{"id":1,"title":"Yahoo Secretly Scanned Customer Emails for the FBI, Say Sources","class":0,"body":"Yahoo secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials, according to people familiar with the matter. The company complied with a classified U.S. government directive, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency or FBI, said two former employees and a third person apprised of the events. Some surveillance experts said this represents the first case to surface of a U.S. Internet company agreeing to a spy agency's demand by searching all arriving messages, as opposed to examining stored messages or scanning a small number of accounts in real time. It is not known what information intelligence officials were looking for, only that they wanted Yahoo to search for a set of characters. That could mean a phrase in an email or an attachment, said the sources, who did not want to be identified.   Reuters was unable to determine what data Yahoo may have handed over, if any, and if intelligence officials had approached other email providers besides Yahoo with this kind of request. According to the two former employees, Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's decision to obey the directive roiled some senior executives and led to the June 2015 departure of Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now holds the top security job at Facebook.  Yahoo is a law abiding company, and complies with the laws of the United States, the company said in a brief statement in response to Reuters questions about the demand. Yahoo declined any further comment.  Through a Facebook spokesman, Stamos declined a request for an interview.  The NSA referred questions to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which declined to comment.  The demand to search Yahoo Mail accounts came in the form of a classified directive sent to the company's legal team, according to the three people familiar with the matter.  U.S. phone and internet companies are known to have handed over bulk customer data to intelligence agencies. But some former government officials and private surveillance experts said they had not previously seen either such a broad directive for real-time Web collection, nor one that required the creation of a new computer program.  I've never seen that, a wiretap in real time on a 'selector,' said Albert Gidari, a lawyer who represented phone and internet companies on surveillance issues for 20 years before moving to Stanford University this year. A selector refers to a type of search term used to zero in on specific information.  It would be really difficult for a provider to do that, he added.  Experts said it was likely that the NSA or FBI had approached other internet companies with the same demand, since they evidently did not know what email accounts were being used by the target. The NSA usually makes requests for domestic surveillance through the FBI, so it is hard to know which agency is seeking the information.  Reuters was unable to confirm whether the 2015 demand went to other companies, or if any complied.  Google and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.   Challenging the NSA   Under laws including the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, intelligence agencies can ask U.S. phone and internet companies to provide customer data to aid foreign intelligence-gathering efforts for a variety of reasons, including prevention of terrorist attack. Some FISA experts said Yahoo could have tried to fight last year's directive on at least two grounds: the breadth of the demand and the necessity of writing a special program to search all customers' emails in transit. Apple made a similar argument earlier this year when it refused to create a special program to break into an encrypted iPhone used in the 2015 San Bernardino massacre. The FBI dropped the case after it unlocked the phone with the help of a third party, so no precedent was set. As tech companies become better at encrypting data, they are likely to face more such requests from spy agencies.  Former NSA General Counsel Stewart Baker said email providers have the power to encrypt it all, and with that comes added responsibility to do some of the work that had been done by the intelligence agencies.  Mayer and other executives ultimately decided to comply with the directive last year rather than fight it, in part because they thought they would lose, said the people familiar with the matter.  In a separate incident, Yahoo last month said state-sponsored hackers had gained access to 500 million customer accounts in 2014. The revelations have brought new scrutiny to Yahoo's security practices as the company tries to complete a deal to sell its core business to Verizon for $4.8 billion."}

{"id":2,"title":"UK security agencies unlawfully collected data for 17 years, court rules","class":0,"body":"Investigatory powers tribunal says secret collection of citizens’ personal data breached human rights law  British security agencies have secretly and unlawfully collected massive volumes of confidential personal data, including financial information, on citizens for more than a decade, senior judges have ruled. The investigatory powers tribunal, which is the only court that hears complaints against MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, said the security services operated an illegal regime to collect vast amounts of communications data, tracking individual phone and web use and other confidential personal information, without adequate safeguards or supervision for 17 years. Privacy campaigners described the ruling as one of the most significant indictments of the secret use of the government’s mass surveillance powers since Edward Snowden first began exposing the extent of British and American state digital surveillance of citizens in 2013. The tribunal said the regime governing the collection of bulk communications data (BCD) – the who, where, when and what of personal phone and web communications – failed to comply with article 8 protecting the right to privacy of the European convention of human rights (ECHR) between 1998, when it started, and 4 November 2015, when it was made public. It added that the retention of of bulk personal datasets (BPD) – which might include medical and tax records, individual biographical details, commercial and financial activities, communications and travel data – also failed to comply with article 8 for the decade it was in operation until it was publicly acknowledged in March 2015. The BPD regime failed to comply with the ECHR principles which we have above set out throughout the period prior to its avowal in March 2015. The BCD regime failed to comply with such principles in the period prior to its avowal in November 2015, and the institution of a more adequate system of supervision as at the same date, the ruling concluded. The ruling comes as the House of Lords is debating the final stages of the investigatory powers bill – the snooper’s charter – which will put the security services’ mass digital surveillance on a clear legal footing for the first time. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the ruling was a sharp reminder that the draconian bill – which Labour has abstained on so far – needed amending to ensure that surveillance powers should not be lightly handed over to the security services without greater accountability. The investigatory powers bill will put mass digital surveillance activities on a clear legal footing for the first time since Snowden’s disclosure. Chaired by Mr Justice Burton, the IPT ruling revealed that security agency staff had been sent internal warnings not to use the databases containing the vast collections of information to search for or access details about other members of staff, neighbours, friends, acquaintances, family members and public figures. It also revealed concerns within the security agencies about the secretive nature of their bulk data collection activities. In February 2010, a Mr Hannigan, then of the Cabinet Office, wrote: It is difficult to assess the extent to which the public is aware of agencies’ holding and exploiting in-house personal bulk datasets, including data on individuals of no intelligence interest … Although existing legislation allows companies and UK government departments to share personal data with the agencies if necessary in the interests of national security, the extent to which this sharing takes place may not be evident to the public. It is not clear from the ruling if this is Robert Hannigan, who went on to run surveillance agency GCHQ from 2014. The campaign group Privacy International said the ruling showed that despite this warning internal oversight failed to prevent the highly sensitive databases being treated like Facebook to check on birthdays, and very worryingly on family members for personal reasons. The IPT ruling included the disclosure from an unpublished 2010 MI5 policy statement that the BPDs included material on the nation’s personal financial activities. The fact that the service holds bulk financial, albeit anonymised, data is assessed to be a high corporate risk, since there is no public expectation that the service will hold or have access to this data in bulk. Were it to become widely known that the service held this data, the media response would most likely be unfavourable and probably inaccurate, it said. The legal challenge centred on the acquisition, use, retention and disclosure by the security services of BCD under section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 and the use of BPDs under a variety of legal powers. The tribunal noted the highly secretive nature of the communications data regime, saying it seems difficult to conclude that the use of BCD was foreseeable by the public when it was not explained to parliament. Mark Scott, of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, who was instructed by Privacy International in the legal challenge, said: This judgment confirms that for over a decade UK security services unlawfully concealed both the extent of their surveillance capabilities and that innocent people across the country have been spied upon. Millie Graham Wood, legal officer at Privacy International, said: [The ruling is] a long overdue indictment of UK surveillance agencies riding roughshod over our democracy and secretly spying on a massive scale. She said the use of BCD carried huge risks. It facilitates the almost instantaneous cataloguing of entire populations’ personal data. It is unacceptable that it is only through litigation by a charity that we have learnt the extent of these powers and how they are used. The public and parliament deserve an explanation as to why everyone’s data was collected for over a decade without oversight in place and confirmation that unlawfully obtained personal data will be destroyed. Privacy International said the judgment did not specify whether the unlawfully obtained, sensitive personal data would be deleted. A government spokesperson said the ruling showed that the regimes used to hold and collect data since March and November 2015 respectively were legal. The powers available to the security and intelligence agencies play a vital role in protecting the UK and its citizens. We are therefore pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes. Through the investigatory powers bill, the government is committed to providing greater transparency and stronger safeguards for all of the bulk powers available to the agencies. Abbott said the disclosure of unlawful activity was shocking: No one is above the law and the security services must be held to account on this. This scandal also has wider political implications, she said adding that the bill places far too much power in the hands of the police and politicians without judicial oversight and diminishes the rights of the citizens. I myself have been a victim of unjustified surveillance over a number of years. To this day I have been given no indication as to whom approved this surveillance and why,she said."}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":3,"title":"UK spy agencies illegally collected data for years, court rules","class":0,"body":"The UK's secret intelligence agencies breached European human rights legislation by secretly collecting communications and personal data in bulk  The U.K.'s spy agencies breached the European Convention on Human Rights for years by secretly collecting almost everything about British citizens' communications except their content, a U.K. court has ruled. However, now that the U.K. government has admitted what it is doing, the collection is legal, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled Monday. It has yet to rule on the issue of proportionality, or whether the agencies' actions were reasonable given the threat they sought to counter. Responding to a June 2015 complaint by campaign group Privacy International, the tribunal said the secret intelligence agencies had breached the ECHR for years because of the way they gathered bulk communications data (BCD) and bulk personal data (BPD). The bulk communications data at issue included who contacted whom, when, where and with what equipment, who paid for the call, and how much they paid. Just about the only information not included is the content of communications, the tribunal said in its ruling. Legally collecting that content would have required an interception warrant. In principle, the government may allow the intelligence agencies to collect communications data from network operators under a 1984 law, the tribunal ruled. However, whether that collection was necessary and proportional is another matter: When the 1984 law was drafted, the tribunal noted, there were no mobile phones and no public internet. Subscriber information was for the most part published in printed directories, so all that network operators could have offered the Security Service and the then officially non-existent Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) was subscriber information for unlisted numbers, and call records, the tribunal noted. The agencies also gathered bulk personal data, including passport databases, telephone directories, and banking records -- even though, the spy agencies acknowledged in a court filing, the majority of the people affected are unlikely to be of intelligence interest. Rules for collection of bulk personal data are not defined in legislation, the tribunal noted. The bulk data gathering remained secret until March 2015, while the collection of bulk communication data was only admitted by the U.K. government in November 2015. While it remained a secret, the collection of both types of data was in breach of the ECHR. After the government admitted what it was doing, and set out oversight rules and a code of practice for the data collection, it became foreseeable, and so legal, as the citizens being spied on could foresee the consequences of their actions, the tribunal ruled. Following the ruling, Privacy International legal officer Millie Graham Wood said the use of bulk communications data poses huge risks. It is unacceptable that it is only through litigation by a charity that we have learned the extent of these powers and how they are used, she said. She called for public confirmation that unlawfully obtained personal data will be destroyed."}

Responding to a complaint brought by Privacy International, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) has ruled that the collection of bulk personal data – conducted by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 between 1998 and 2015 – was unlawful. It ruled that surveillance of individuals’ phone and web use had been taking place without adequate safeguards or supervision for more than a decade. It also says some instances of data collection were in breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which ensures all citizens have the right to a private life and that any interference with personal data must be lawful and necessary. Its collection of ‘Bulk Communications Data’ (BCD) and ‘Bulk Personal Datasets’ (BPD) by the agencies failed to comply with ECHR protections until codes of practices were put in place in 2015, the tribunal added. BCD consists of the ‘where, when and what’ of messages sent to individuals. BDP allows officials to collect information that could cover health, tax and electoral information. While each of these datasets in themselves may be innocuous, intelligence value is added in the interaction between multiple datasets, the court documents state. The tribunal revealed the collection of financial data was also of particular concern. The fact that [MI5] holds bulk financial, albeit anonymised, data is assessed to be a high corporate risk, since there is no public expectation that the service will hold or have access to this data in bulk.

{"id":5,"title":"Security agencies collected data unlawfully, UK court rules","class":0,"body":"British spy agencies collected data illegally for more than a decade, a court has ruled. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which investigates complaints against intelligence services, ruled on Monday that the agencies’ secretive collection and use of bulk communications data (BCD) failed to comply with human rights laws until 2015. The ruling is the result of a case brought by privacy campaigners Privacy International that challenged the collection and use of bulk data by security agencies GCHQ, MI5 and MI6. Since 1998, telecoms companies have been forced to provide the security services with regular access to BCD – the who, what, where and when of personal communications data, including information such as the location and time of a communication made by phone or over the internet, but not the content of the message. This information reveals a lot about you, says Camilla Graham Wood from Privacy International. If someone knows who you’ve been speaking to and when you’ve been speaking to them, they can make some strong conclusions. The right to privacy is enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). For security agencies to legally collect data about the public, they need to disclose information about their activities and have adequate oversight and safeguards in place. That wasn’t done, says Wood. In fact, nobody was told. Not parliament and not the public. The tribunal concluded that BCD was collected unlawfully from March 1998 until November 2015, when the data collection programme was made public and a more adequate system of supervision was introduced. The agencies also breached privacy laws when they collected another type of data called bulk personal data (BPD), the exact details of which are still unknown but which Privacy International says could include tax records and medical records. We know that this personal information has been collected and stored by intellligence agencies since around 2006.The BPD regime failed to comply with the ECHR principles… throughout the period prior to its avowal in March 2015, the tribunal concluded. However, the tribunal found that the agencies’ collection of BCD and BPD both now comply with Article 8. We are pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes, the government said in a statement. The statement didn’t address any of the aspects of previous illegality mentioned in the judgement. One issue that still remains unclear is proportionality – the question of whether the risks associated with such vast data collection programmes are outweighed by the benefits, says Paul Bernal, at University of East Anglia Law School, UK. Every time this issue comes up, the agencies say ‘if we told you we would compromise people in the field’, making it impossible to establish the evidence for each side, he says. The tribunal has not yet come to a conclusion on this issue. In the meantime, the government has made its intentions on surveillance clear with the new Investigatory Powers Bill – also known as the snooper’s charter – which is due to become law in the next few weeks. The bill was overwhelmingly passed during its second reading and strengthens current surveillance legislation, making it easier for government agencies to access data, including requiring content service providers to keep a record of the websites internet users visit. Ever since the Snowden revelations, state surveillance programmes have increasingly come under the spotlight, despite government denials. The obvious question is, says Bernal, what else are they doing that we haven’t yet."}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":6,"title":"MI6, MI5 and GCHQ 'unlawfully collected private data for 10 years","class":0,"body":"GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 unlawfully gathered 'Bulk Communications Data' and 'Bulk Personal Datasets' The UK's security services, including GCHQ, MI5 and MI6, have been unlawfully collecting and using mass datasets of personal information for more than 10 years. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal has ruled in a judgement published online that the bodies had been collecting data without safeguards or supervision. The setups of 'Bulk Communications Data' (BCD) and 'Bulk Personal Datasets' by the agencies did not comply with the right to privacy (Article 8) in the European Convention on Human Rights. The two schemes failed to comply with the ECHR protections until they were admitted and codes of practices were put in place in 2015, the tribunal added. BCD consists of the 'where, when and what' of messages sent between individuals. BPD allow officials to collect mass datasets that could cover health, tax, and electoral information. Both types of datasets have been used as part of criminal investigations, but have been criticised by privacy advocates for being overly intrusive. The tribunal added that the massive datasets (BPD) include considerable volumes of data about biographical details, commercial and financial activities, communications and travel. While each of these datasets in themselves may be innocuous, intelligence value is added in the interaction between multiple datasets, the court documents state. BPD are used by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6; BCD is only obtained and used by GCHQ and MI5. Privacy International, a civil liberties group which took the action to court, said the ruling was highly significant and it confirmed the bodies were secretly spying on a massive scale. When Theresa May, as Home Secretary, introduced the controversial Investigatory Powers Bill – to reform the UK's surveillance laws – in November 2015, it was admitted that the bodies used Section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 to collect data under both the BCD and BPD regimes. The tribunal said a number of opportunities to admit to this before 2015 had not been taken. The powers put in place in 2015 were deemed lawful by the tribunal. However, it is not known what will happen to data collected under the unlawful regimes. In any event it seems difficult to conclude that the use of BCD was foreseeable by the public, when it was not explained to Parliament; and several opportunities arose when legislation or Codes of Practice were being introduced or amended, the tribunal said. It drew particular attention to the passing of S.80 of RIPA in 2000. The court's ruling comes as the government's Investigatory Powers Bill (IP Bill) is in the final stages of becoming law – it is currently passed through the House of Commons and is being debated by the House of Lords. The Bill has been heavily criticised by numerous committees and officials. Powers included in the IP Bill include bulk collection of data, the ability to remotely hack mobile phones and computers, and the storing of website history. The law is the first time these powers have been specifically written into law. In response to the ruling, a government spokesperson said the powers were needed to protect UK citizens. We are therefore pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes, the spokesperson said. Through the Investigatory Powers Bill, the government is committed to providing greater transparency and stronger safeguards for all of the bulk powers available to the agencies."}

No, UK citizens need to keep their eyes on the prize: the ten months or so of legal spying UK intelligence agencies have been engaged in, as well as the eventual codification of other possibly-illegal surveillance programs. This information reveals a lot about you, says Camilla Graham Wood from Privacy International. Bulk communications data includes details of websites visited, email contacts, records of email traffic, the location of mobile phones and call data. The programs were re-introduced in the Investigatory Powers Bill, which has yet to pass, although supposedly some privacy protections have been added this time. Further powers will be given to GCHQ and other spying agencies under the Investigatory Powers Bill, which is now in its final stages before being passed by parliament. BPD can be searched by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6. One of the reasons is that bulk data such as personal financial transactions or communications, for instance, would be too laborious to analyze manually for each individual. While it remained a secret, the collection of both types of data was in breach of the ECHR. Such analysis would nearly always result in high numbers of false positives. However, now that the United Kingdom government has admitted what it is doing, the collection is legal, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled Monday. In February 2010 a Mr Hannigan, then of the Cabinet Office, wrote of their handling of these massive volumes of personal data: It is hard to assess the extent to which the public is aware of agencies' holding and exploiting in-house personal bulk datasets, including data on individuals of no intelligence interest. That's because there was no code of practice nor proper oversight to prevent such abuses. In any event it seems hard to conclude that the use of BCD was foreseeable by the public, when it was not explained to Parliament, the judgement continues. Today's judgment is a long overdue indictment of United Kingdom surveillance agencies riding roughshod over our democracy and secretly spying on a massive scale, said Millie Graham Wood, legal officer at Privacy International. However, Privacy International, which launched a lawsuit against the United Kingdom intelligence agencies over these issues, isn't quite as content with the additional oversight measures. British spy agencies collected data illegally for more than a decade, a court has ruled. He said: 'Allowing the state to collect endless amounts of personal data is not just a gross invasion of privacy, it is a waste of precious resources. Courts have existed for this reason-as a check-but they seem to have been mostly taken out of the equation when it comes to United Kingdom intelligence data requests. As well as this entire databases can be shared with foreign partners, industrial partners and other government agencies.

In a case brought forward by campaigning group Privacy International, the Tribunal found the collection of bulk communications data (BCD) and bulk personal datasets (BPDs) was in breach of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). The BPD regime failed to comply with the ECHR principles which we have above set out throughout the period prior to its avowal in March 2015, the court ruled, adding the BCD regime failed to comply with such principles in the period prior to its avowal in November 2015. In a 70-page ruling, the court found the proper legal backing was finally put in place last year however called out the intelligence community for not reporting the use of bulk collection to elected officials sooner. It said it seems difficult to conclude that the use of BCD was foreseeable by the public, when it was not explained to Parliament. Several opportunities [to inform] arose when legislation or codes of practice were being introduced or amended (and particularly in 2000 when s.80 of RIPA was passed), when the government of the day did not avow the use of section 94 [which governs communications intercepts], it said. Unlike MI6, GCHQ and MI5 both collect and store bulk communications data including the metadata gleaned from internet browsing, emails, GPS locations, phonecalls and text messages. Meanwhile, all three agencies store bulk personal datasets – which can include electoral registers, medical records and tax histories. The majority of individuals whose personal data is contained in a BPD will be of no intelligence interest, the intelligence agencies admit. The judgment does not specify whether the sensitive personal data determined to be collected unlawfully will be deleted. Despite the Tribunal ruling the agencies' use of these bulk data systems now have legal backing, Privacy International maintains that safeguards remain inadequate, arguing that there is still no procedure for notifying the victims of any misuse of bulk data collection. The campaigning group called the released of the IPT report one of the most significant indictments of the secret use of the Government's mass surveillance powers since Edward Snowden first began exposing the extent of US and UK spying in 2013.

{"id":9,"title":"Germany orders Facebook to stop collecting data on WhatsApp users","class":0,"body":"Privacy watchdog says data-sharing scheme is 'an infringement of national data protection law' Facebook has been ordered to stop collecting and storing data on WhatsApp users in Germany, marking the first regulatory challenge to a controversial data-sharing scheme that the social media company announced in August. In a statement published Tuesday, Germany's privacy watchdog said that sharing WhatsApp user data with Facebook, the messaging app's parent company, constitutes an infringement of national data protection law. The regulatory body also ordered Facebook to delete all data that has already been transferred from WhatsApp. Facebook's data-sharing scheme has been closely monitored by privacy groups across Europe. When Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014, the app's co-founder, Jan Koum, assured users that their privacy would not be compromised. Under the policy announced in August, however, WhatsApp will share some user data — including phone numbers — with Facebook, and plans to allow businesses to contact users directly through its app. FACEBOOK HAS TO ASK FOR THEIR PERMISSION IN ADVANCE. THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED. WhatsApp has said that the arrangement will allow Facebook to deliver more targeted advertising and friend suggestions, and that analytics data will help combat spam and fraud. But privacy advocates have criticized the companies for not being transparent about the change. In a blog post published after the announcement, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) described the move as a clear threat to users’ control of how their WhatsApp data is shared and used. Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg data protection commissioner, echoed those concerns in a statement on Tuesday, saying that Facebook has not obtained effective approval of the policy change from WhatsApp users. Caspar also expressed concern that Facebook may eventually seek to collect data on a broader range of users, including those listed in WhatsApp contacts lists who are not connected to Facebook. This administrative order protects the data of about 35 million WhatsApp users in Germany, Caspar said. It has to be their decision, whether they want to connect their account with Facebook. Therefore, Facebook has to ask for their permission in advance. This has not happened. Other privacy regulators have raised concerns over the data-sharing scheme. CNIL, France's data protection authority and the chair of a group of privacy regulators across Europe, said in August that privacy watchdogs will be monitoring the change to WhatsApp's policy with great vigilance. The Information Commission's Office (ICO), Britain's data privacy regulator, also said it would monitor how data is shared across the two platforms, though it does not have the authority to block the scheme altogether. In an email statement, a Facebook spokesperson said that the company will appeal the order from Germany's privacy watchdog. Facebook complies with EU data protection law, the spokesperson said. We will appeal this order and we will work with the Hamburg DPA in an effort to address their questions and resolve any concerns."}

Now, a German regulator thinks so, too.The city of Hamburg’s data protection commissioner ordered Facebook on Tuesday to stop collecting and storing data on WhatsApp users in Germany, the first time a privacy watchdog has waded into the debate. The regulator also called on the social network to delete all information already forwarded from WhatsApp on roughly 35 million German users. It has to be their decision, whether they want to connect their account with Facebook, Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg data protection commissioner, said in a statement. Therefore, Facebook has to ask for their permission in advance. This has not happened. Facebook said on Tuesday, after the order had been issued, that it had complied with Europe’s privacy rules and that it was willing to work with the regulator to address its concerns. The Hamburg regulator has authority over Facebook’s activities in Germany because the company’s German subsidiary is based in the city. The privacy pushback comes as WhatsApp, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion, is trying to forge closer links with the social network and to look for new ways to generate revenue from its more than one billion users worldwide. As part of its proposed overhaul, WhatsApp said it would start disclosing the phone numbers and analytics data of its users to Facebook. WhatsApp also has plans to allow businesses to contact customers directly through its platform. A similar strategy is being tested on Facebook Messenger, a separate messaging service Facebook owns. While WhatsApp has framed the changes as a way to give people a better service, not everyone is convinced. A day after the announcement, the British privacy regulator said that it was looking into the changes. More than any other region, Europe has pushed back against American technology giants’ use of people’s digital information, routinely forcing companies like Google and Facebook to change their policies after they breached the European Union’s tough data protection rules.  In its decision on Tuesday, which would affect only WhatsApp users in Germany, the Hamburg regulator said that neither the internet messenger nor Facebook had received individuals’ permission to share the information and had potentially misled people over how their data would be used in the future. The watchdog added that millions of people whose contact details had been uploaded to WhatsApp could now have that information shared with Facebook against their will, which would infringe German law.Facebook’s answer, that this has merely not been done for the time being, is cause for concern that the gravity of the data protection breach will have a more severe impact, Mr. Caspar said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":11,"title":"Colts app is spying on fans’ conversations, suit claims","class":0,"body":"The official app for the Indianapolis Colts does more than give the latest stats and injury updates — it also eavesdrops on users’ conversations, according to a fan who is suing the team and the app developer. The lawsuit, filed Friday in US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, claims the app is systematically and surreptitiously intercepting consumers’ oral communications whether they’re watching the game at work, checking the waiver wire at home or cheering on quarterback Andrew Luck at Lucas Oil Stadium. With the microphone activated, the app listens to and records all audio within range — including consumer conversations, according to the lawsuit, which was first reported by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Alan Rackemann, of Franklin, Ind., claims he installed the app on his phone in 2012. He stopped using it in September once he realized the app was listening in, the complaint alleges. ackemann, who declined comment when reached by The Post, claims the app has been downloaded as many as 500,000 times and puts all users at risk once they agree to allow it access to their phone’s microphone. The app, according to the suit, activated the microphones on all users’ phones before and during the Colts’ home game in Indianapolis against the Chicago Bears on Oct. 9. Consumers’ microphones were activated no matter where they were — in church, in their cars or in their homes, the complaint reads. Rackemann’s attorney did not immediately return a request for comment. It’s unclear how Rackemann learned that the app was allegedly eavesdropping on him. The lawsuit named the Colts, the app’s developer, Pennsylvania-based YinzCam, and Ohio-based LISNR, which created the technology used in the app, as defendants. The founder and CEO of LISNR, Rodney Williams, denied the allegations, saying the company does not collect or share any personal information and does not record audio. We are stewards of consumer privacy and will defend all allegations vigorously, Williams wrote The Post in a statement. Most sounds that we hear every day, like the sound of a human voice, simply aren’t detectable by LISNR as they fall well below our high frequency range and are filtered out completely by our technology. Priya Narasimhan, founder and CEO of YinzCam, said the Colts moved to a new developer that took over the app, adding new features that are now being challenged in court. Those features were not part of the app as developed by YinzCam, Narasimhan said in an email. YinzCam therefore expects to be dropped from the lawsuit. A message seeking comment from the Colts was not returned. The team partnered with LISNR in 2014 to add beacon technology to its app, the Indy Star reports. The technology allows the Colts to send customized ads, content and promotions to users based on location and preferences. The app locates those fans by using the microphone on users’ phones and the company’s audio beacons."}

Allan, who was formerly commercial director at the theatre and creative director of award-winning Enchanted Forest, is alleged to have kept up the secret spying campaign between 2011 and 2014. He appeared in the dock at Perth Sheriff Court to deny the charge against him and a trial has been scheduled for February next year. He denies that on various occasions between 13 May 2011 and 31 October 2014 he conducted himself in a disorderly manner and breached the peace. Allan denies making offensive remarks to one woman while staring at her breasts at the theatre and secretly filming her and another named woman. It is alleged that several other - as yet unidentified - women were also covertly filmed. Allan, Glebe Street, Dumfries, who now operates a consultancy business, pled not guilty and his solicitor told the court he was planning to prepare a report for the case. Solicitor Andrew Houston said: There are ongoing inquiries which will require the instruction of a professional witness, which is likely to take a number of weeks.

{"id":13,"title":"UK surveillance agencies illegally kept data on British citizens' communications, spying court finds","class":0,"body":"UK spying agencies illegally stored data about the country’s citizens for more than a decade, according to a new judgement. The collection of data on everyone’s communications was illegal between 1998 and 2015, according to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, the watchdog for intelligence agencies.But spying agencies will be able to continue collecting data on citizens because of small tweaks to the law that allow them to get around the ruling. The UK’s bulk collection program was first revealed by Edward Snowden. It allowed GCHQ to break into internet cables and other communications and use that data to build up huge databases about people, with no regulation or oversight. It was doing so illegally, without any code of practice or other rules to govern how the information was being used, according to the secretive spying court. The hearingshowed how information was being abused – with cases including spies who checked information on their friends or public figures, used it to check on birthdays, and spied on family members for personal reasons. The judgement doesn’t make clear whether that information will be deleted or if GCHQ can continue using it. But the spying won’t actually have to stop, despite the decision. Last November, the bulk collection programme was changed so that the agencies had to disclose more about what they’re doing – that made the work legal, despite making no change to how it actually works. Further powers will be given to GCHQ and other spying agencies under the Investigatory Powers Bill, which is currently in its final stages before being passed by Parliament. That law will clear up the regulation of intelligence agencies, but it will also hand over unprecedented powers to those same spying organisations criticised in the new report. Privacy International, which brought the case, said that the judgement showed that spying powers were not being properly regulated or described to the public. Today's judgment is a long overdue indictment of UK surveillance agencies riding roughshod over our democracy and secretly spying on a massive scale. There are huge risks associated with the use of bulk communications data, said Millie Graham Wood, legal officer at Privacy International. It facilitates the almost instantaneous cataloguing of entire populations' personal data. It is unacceptable that it is only through litigation by a charity that we have learnt the extent of these powers and how they are used. The public and Parliament deserve an explanation as to why everyone’s data was collected for over a decade without oversight in place and confirmation that unlawfully obtained personal data will be destroyed. The Liberal Democrats said that the findings showed that as well as intruding on people’s privacy, Britain’s spying agencies were wasting resources. Every pound spent monitoring people’s emails, text messages and calls is a pound taken away from community policing, said the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael. Mass spying on the British people should be replaced with targeted surveillance of specific individuals suspected of wrongdoing."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":14,"title":"U.K. spy agencies illegally collected data for years, court rules","class":0,"body":"The UK's secret intelligence agencies breached European human rights legislation by secretly collecting  communications and personal data in bulk The U.K.'s spy agencies breached the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) for years by secretly collecting almost everything about British citizens' communications except their content, a U.K. court has ruled. However, now that the U.K. government has admitted what it is doing, the collection is legal, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled Monday. It has yet to rule on the issue of proportionality, or whether the agencies' actions were reasonable given the threat they sought to counter. Responding to a June 2015 complaint by campaign group Privacy International, the tribunal said the secret intelligence agencies had breached the ECHR for years because of the way they gathered bulk communications data and bulk personal data. The bulk communications data at issue included who contacted whom, when, where and with what equipment, who paid for the call, and how much they paid. Just about the only information not included is the content of communications, the tribunal said in its ruling. Legally collecting that content would have required an interception warrant. In principle, the government may allow the intelligence agencies to collect communications data from network operators under a 1984 law, the tribunal ruled. However, whether that collection was necessary and proportional is another matter: When the 1984 law was drafted, the tribunal noted, there were no mobile phones and no public internet. Subscriber information was for the most part published in printed directories, so all that network operators could have offered the Security Service and the then officially non-existent Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) was subscriber information for unlisted numbers, and call records, the tribunal noted. The agencies also gathered bulk personal data, including passport databases, telephone directories and banking records -- even though, the spy agencies acknowledged in a court filing, the majority of the people affected are unlikely to be of intelligence interest. Rules for collection of bulk personal data are not defined in legislation, the tribunal noted. The bulk data gathering remained secret until March 2015, while the collection of bulk communication data was only admitted by the U.K. government in November 2015. While it remained a secret, the collection of both types of data was in breach of the ECHR. After the government admitted what it was doing, and set out oversight rules and a code of practice for the data collection, it became foreseeable, and so legal, as the citizens being spied on could foresee the consequences of their actions, the tribunal ruled. Following the ruling, Privacy International legal officer Millie Graham Wood said the use of bulk communications data poses huge risks. It is unacceptable that it is only through litigation by a charity that we have learned the extent of these powers and how they are used, she said. She called for public confirmation that unlawfully obtained personal data will be destroyed."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":15,"title":"Why Google’s Spying on User Data Is Worse than the NSA’s","class":0,"body":"There is an odd cadence to the debate on the National Security Agency spying on user data supplied by social media companies like Google and Facebook, as if the comprehensive, integrated profiles of user data controlled by large multinational corporations was only a problem when the government got hold of them. Don’t get me wrong.  I opposed the Patriot Act and follow-up amendments and think the national security state is a danger that needs to be severely reined in.   Which is why I was quite happy that Edward Snowden’s disclosures have highlighted the problem of national security state access to user data created in the wake of 9-11. But the potential abuses due to corporate access to that data are as bad as the NSA control — and the documented harm to the public has been worse. Illegal Corporate Data Collection Let’s start with data collection itself.  While the legal basis for the NSA collection has been challenged, both the courts and Congressional Committees overseeing the collection have generally approved the program.  Compare that to companies like Google, which have violated the law repeatedly to collect user data. Google’s illegal wi-spy program of collecting user data over home wi-fi hubs using its Street View cars has led to investigations and fines for violations of the law in countries around the world.  Investigators were outraged when they reviewed the downloaded data and found Google had collected massive amounts of personal emails and data revealing everything from people’s medical histories to their sexual preference to marital infidelity.  (Google’s defense that that it was all okay because they never looked at the illegally collected data is eerily similar to the NSA’s). When challenged on its illegal data collection, the company lied and stonewalled investigators around the world, with the Federal Communications Commission finding the company guilty of willfully ignoring subpoenas to delay investigations into the scandal, fining the company in a 25-page condemnation in April 2012 that concluded Google’s failure to cooperate with the Bureau was in many or all cases deliberate. Both Google and Facebook were charged with violating privacy laws in launching their social media networks and both had to agree to 20-year consent decrees to monitor their privacy policies. But a year after entering its consent decree, the Federal Trade Commission found Google had secretly placed cookies to track the online activities of people using the Safari web browser, despite having publicly told these users they would automatically be opted out of such tracking. Google had deliberately found a vulnerability in Safari’s default cookie-blocking setting in order to collect the information for its advertising data collection purposes, while publicly misrepresenting to users that it was not doing so.  The company paid a $22.5 million fine for this illegal data collection operation. The Harm to Users from Corporate Misuse of Personal Data The illegal data collection is just the start of the problem with corporate use of personal data.  At least one reason I think the NSA spying hasn’t led to a public opinion backlash calling for its end is that there’s been no documentation of the program being used to harm individual Americans. But we know for a fact that companies like Google are giving corporate advertisers access to users based on the personal data they control — and many of those advertisers are targeting individuals with the express intent to rip them off, sell them deadly products, and financially impoverish them. Some advertisers are just trying to help customers find a product they might like, but the dark version of online marketing is that it can facilitate what economists call price discrimination, selling the same exact good at a variety of prices in ways unknown to the buyers. Researchers Rosa-Branc Esteves and Joana Resendehighlight how with the low costs of online advertising, such online price discrimination systematically shifts wealth from consumers to corporate profits. One implication of their models is that average prices with mass advertising [i.e. without the discrimination allowed by targeting individual users online] are below those with targeted advertising, which follows the idea that firms will target certain consumers with promotions while enjoying higher prices paid by consumers kept ignorant of lower prices offered to others. Early Internet visionary Jaron Lanier, who pioneered ideas like virtual reality two decades ago, has noted that such access to behavioral targeting has even more appeal to the tawdry kinds of firms than the dignified side of capitalism, since ambulance chasers and snake oil salesmen among the capitalist class thrive on such targeted access to their victims. And the specter of racist use of that data is all too real; As ColorLines magazinehas argued, a user’s browsing history, their location and IP information...combined with information available in Google’s public data explorer (including US census, education, population, STD stats, and state financial data) presumably could also be folded into the personalized search algorithm to surmise a lot more than your race. While not conclusive, there is evidence of companies using names or other evidence such as physical location to offer differential advertising through Google based on race and ethnicity. Targeting Consumers for Financial Ruin What is unquestionable is that Google advertising lay at the heart of the largest example of price discrimination and consumer harm of the last few decades, namely the subprime mortgage destruction of family wealth and the financial crisis that followed.  Google isn’t usually identified as a big player in the subprime mortgage debacle and its aftermath, but a significant portion of Google’s profits in the mid-2000s were coming straight from subprime mortgage lenders advertising on its site.  As Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy said back in 2007, Many online companies depend for a disproportionate amount of their income on financial services advertising, with subprime in some cases accounting for a large part of it. Companies enticed customers with unrealistic teaser rates — heavily advertised online — that burdened borrowers with toxic terms and unmanageable obligations that exploded in later years.   And as the racial and exploitive aspect of the mortgage meltdown was endemic with what some scholars described as reverse redlining, the practice of targeting borrowers of color for loans on unfavorable terms. This offering of differential rates based on the characteristics of the borrower constitutes the most damaging price discrimination inflicting consumer harm in American history, for which Google played an integral (and profitable) role as an advertising intermediary where it was earning billions of dollars a year in that role. The financial industry remains the bedrock of Google’s advertising revenues.  According to WordStream, a company specializing in helping companies bid effectively on Google Ads, the three most expensive categories of keyword searches as measured by cost per click are in financial services (insurance, loans and mortgages), with 45.6 percent of the top 10,000 advertising keywords falling in those categories. And many of those advertising bidders at Google are from the more bottom-feeding aspects of the industry, particularly payday loan lenders, who offer extremely high-interest loans for consumers made in exchange for a commitment to repayment from the person’s next paycheck.  Such loans have been banned or severely restricted as exploitative in multiple states. Google actively solicits ads from the payday lending industry, including setting up a trade booth at the Online Lenders Alliance, a trade group comprised mainly of payday lenders.  Robert X. Cringely, who has covered Silicon Valley for over 25 years, argues that out of financial self-interest, Google is burying bad news about the industry for consumers, since he found Google placed the uniformly negative news items near the bottom of the results, below the fold as we used to say in the newspaper business. Whether Google is actively hiding damning consumer analysis of the evils of its financial advertisers, what is true is that Google maintained ads from fraudulent mortgage loan modification firms preying on desperate homeowners even after the company was alerted to the problem.  Despite consumer group Consumer Watchdog publishing a scathing report highlighting the concentration of such firms advertising online, Google did nothing until the Treasury Department took regulatory action in November 2011 under its TARP authority to shut down 85 of these scam advertisers who were luring customers through Google. Many homeowners who fall prey to these scams, initially do so through these Web banners and other Web advertising, Christy Romero, Deputy Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, said in an interview. You just can’t separate the massive financial destruction of American households in the recent financial crisis and its aftermath from the corporate use of consumer data to target ads and suck consumers into those financial scams. Bottom-Feeders Exploiting User Data Online In a similar vein, a whole range of scam artists, fake drug peddlers and underage escort services use user data provided by corporate partners like Google to find their victims.   In 2012, Google agreed to pay a $500 million civil forfeiture to the federal government, one of the largest in history, as part of a settlement penalizing the company for illegally and knowingly allowing illegal pharmacies to advertise on its site.  This was not passive activity by Google, but active complicity with advertisers often selling fake prescription medicine to desperately ill individuals or marketing illegal steroids.  [Google CEO] Larry Page knew what was going on, Peter Neronha, the Rhode Island U.S. Attorney who led the probe, told the Wall Street Journal. The National Association of Human Trafficking Victim Advocates (NAHTVA) along with 37 other prominent anti-trafficking organizations have accused Google ofprofiting off of the sex trafficking of women, while a recent session of the National Association of Attorneys General noted the widespread targeting of ads for illegal products to users online, including recruiting children as underage escorts and pushing illegal drugs to kids. Given the documented history of online corporate exploitation of user data, it becomes ridiculous to argue that it’s a bigger problem that the NSA was grabbing the data then that corporate exploiters like Google had the data themselves in the first place.   Even a lot of ostensible lefties seem to be a bit too complacent in seeing the only problem with centralized data control being when government has it. Imposing Regulation and Transparency on Data Collection and Use by Both Government and Corporations None of this is to say we don’t need to more tightly rein in how the National Security Agency uses personal data, but some of that has been done already and more is being talked about in Capitol Hill.   The missing piece is any serious movement on reining in corporate control of personal data. Google and Facebook and other data mining companies are trying to position themselves as defenders of user privacy, but when California tried to pass simple law this year to allow users to simply find out what data has been collected about them by online companies — the privacy equivalent of a credit report — those same companies mobilized and killed the bill dead in its tracks. (See Silicon Valley Stomps on Digital Disclosure Bill).Governments and companies are going to have more data about than we are comfortable with — that’s a fact of life in the digital age. In many cases, I’m actually happier to have government with the data than private companies — we all know the ways private insurance companies have used health data to discriminate against sick patients. But across the board, people should have far greater knowledge of exactly what data governments and corporations have about them and we need much tougher rules to make sure that the national security state can’t abuse potential dissidents with that data and that predatory financial firms aren’t assisted by companies like Google in preying on consumers using their data either."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":16,"title":"UK internet providers to collect data on illegal downloaders - reports","class":0,"body":"Media companies have asked UK broadband providers to collate info on illegal downloaders, which could violate data protection laws. Those caught committing piracy could be subject to internet throttling and even prosecution. In an attempt to clamp down on the illegal downloading of music and films, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the British Video Association have requested BT, Virgin Media, BSkyB and TalkTalk to record information on piracy. The new code of conduct would oblige the companies to gather data on illegal downloaders and store it in a database. The information could then lead to repeat offenders having their internet cut-off or being prosecuted. Internet users will reportedly been given warnings by letter before these measures are taken, reports the Guardian. The move has attracted controversy amid speculation that it may violate the Data Protection Act, as the law says that companies may only retain personal data relating to a client if it is for commercial purposes. Music and film companies are speaking to broadband providers about how to address illegal file-sharing, but what they're currently proposing is unworkable, Virgin Media spokeswoman Emma Hutchinson told the Guardian. While a spokeswoman from TalkTalk said the new measure was currently under discussions, but customers' rights always come first and we would never agree to anything that could compromise them.The proposal comes as part of a nationwide clampdown on growing internet piracy. Between November 2012 and January 2013, UK watchdog Offcom reported that 280 million music tracks had been pirated, as well as 52 million television programs. Furthermore, Offcom found that 18 percent of internet users aged over 12 had recently committed internet piracy, while one 9 percent actually fear getting caught. Weeding out piracy The UK has already taken some measures to cut down on internet piracy. The website The Pirate Bay is now blocked in Britain and the government has threatened legal action against six members of the Pirate Party for refusing to take down a Pirate Bay proxy website.  Following legal threats by the BPI, the Pirate Party UK decided to shut down the proxy website. Moreover, the BPI launched an unprecedented attack on torrent sites in May, seeking to block 25 web addresses.  The BPI maintain that the measures are taken to ensure protect the artists’ and legal services’ rights. However, UK Pirate Party leader Loz Kaye told RT that record labels were using the measures to maintain their monopoly and push smaller companies out of business."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":17,"title":" N.S.A. Collection of Bulk Call Data Is Ruled Illegal s","class":0,"body":" WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court in New York ruled on Thursday that the once-secret National Security Agency program that is systematically collecting Americans’ phone records in bulk is illegal. The decision comes as a fight in Congress is intensifying over whether to end and replace the program, or to extend it without changes. In a 97-page ruling, a three-judge panel for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that a provision of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, known as Section 215, cannot be legitimately interpreted to allow the bulk collection of domestic calling records. The provision of the act used to justify the bulk data program is to expire June 1, and the ruling is certain to increase tension that has been building in Congress. It also comes as controversy over electronic surveillance is building in Europe, including a push in France to increase domestic spying and a decision by Germany to reduce cooperation on surveillance with the United States. The ruling puts new pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to make serious changes to the Patriot Act, which he has so far aggressively defended against any alteration, even as recently as Thursday on the Senate floor. Mr. McConnell has pressed to maintain the N.S.A.’s existing program against bipartisan efforts to scale it back, and has proposed simply extending the statute by the June 1 deadline. But the court’s ruling calls into question whether that statute can still be used to issue new orders to phone companies requiring them to turn over their customers’ records. Thursday’s ruling is the first time a higher-level court in the regular judicial system has reviewed the N.S.A. phone records program. It did not come with any injunction ordering the program to cease, and it is not clear that anything else will happen in the judicial system before Congress has to make a decision about the expiring law. The data collection had repeatedly been approved in secret by judges serving on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, known as the FISA court, which oversees national security surveillance. Those judges, who hear arguments only from the government, were willing to accept an interpretation of Section 215 that the appeals court rejected on Thursday. The court, in a unanimous ruling written by Judge Gerard E. Lynch, held that Section 215 cannot bear the weight the government asks us to assign to it, and that it does not authorize the telephone metadata program. It declared the program illegal, saying, We do so comfortably in the full understanding that if Congress chooses to authorize such a far-reaching and unprecedented program, it has every opportunity to do so, and to do so unambiguously. The House appears ready to pass a bill next week that would end the government’s bulk collection of phone records. That bill, known as the U.S.A. Freedom Act, would replace it with a new program that would preserve the N.S.A.’s ability to analyze links between callers to hunt for terrorists, but keep the bulk records in the hands of phone companies, which would be free to dispose of them after 18 months. The N.S.A. keeps them for five years. But the appeals court ruling raises the question of whether Section 215, extended or not, has ever legitimately authorized the program. The statute on its face permits only the collection of records deemed relevant to a national security case. The government secretly decided, with the FISA court’s secret approval, that this could be interpreted to mean collection of all records, so long as only those that later turn out to be relevant are scrutinized by analysts. However, Judge Lynch wrote: Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans. Perhaps such a contraction is required by national security needs in the face of the dangers of contemporary domestic and international terrorism. But we would expect such a momentous decision to be preceded by substantial debate, and expressed in unmistakable language. The White House argued that the ruling in effect validated President Obama’s support for legislation taking the government out of bulk data collection and leaving the information with the telecommunications companies. Our team is still reviewing the details of the ruling, Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, told reporters. But we believe that regardless of the fine print of that ruling, that legislation is the way to go. Judge Lynch, who was appointed by Mr. Obama, was joined in the decision by Judge Robert D. Sack, a Clinton appointee, and Judge Vernon S. Broderick, another Obama appointee. Judge Broderick usually hears Federal District Court cases but was sitting on the appeals court for this case as a visiting judge. The appeals court sent the matter back to a Federal District Court judge to decide what to do next. The government could also appeal the ruling to the full appeals court, or to the Supreme Court. Parallel cases are pending before two other appeals courts that have not yet ruled. Alexander Abdo, who argued the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, praised the ruling as a victory for the rule of law that should spur Congress into action. Several lawmakers who helped draft the U.S.A. Freedom Act seized on it as justification for enacting their bill. Among them, Senators Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, said in a joint statement: Congress should not reauthorize a bulk collection program that the court has found to violate the law. We will not consent to any extension of this program. But Mr. McConnell gave no ground. On Thursday he blasted the House bill as an untested, untried and more cumbersome system that would neither keep us safe or protect our privacy. Section 215 helps us find a needle in the haystack, he said. But under the U.S.A. Freedom Act, there might not be a haystack at all. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said both sides now have to come to the table because it was not clear that either option — the U.S.A. Freedom Act or extending the existing program — has the 60-vote support necessary to overcome a filibuster. Mr. McConnell has the power to decide which bills get brought up for a vote. To create more time for debate, Democrats might permit an extension of the existing statute for a month, said a person familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss their progress. The Democrats would do that in exchange for a promise by Mr. McConnell to allow a vote on the House bill in June. Still, even if there were votes in Congress for a short-term extension of the existing statute, Thursday’s ruling would create potential political and legal difficulties for keeping the program going in the interim. To bridge any gap between the existing program and a new one, the Obama administration would have to ask the FISA court to reauthorize the program, and a FISA judge would have to agree to do so, notwithstanding the Second Circuit’s ruling that Section 215 cannot authorize such an order. (The FISA court is not directly subject to the Second Circuit’s authority because it has its own appeals court.) In a statement, Edward Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the administration was still evaluating the ruling but reiterated Mr. Obama’s support for legislation that would transform the program is in line with the U.S.A. Freedom Act. The bulk phone records program traces back to October 2001. After the Sept. 11 attacks, President George W. Bush secretly authorized the N.S.A. to begin a group of surveillance and data-collection programs, without obeying statutory limits on government spying, for the purpose of hunting for terrorist cells. Over time, the legal basis for each component of that program, known as Stellarwind, evolved. In 2006, the administration persuaded a FISA court judge to issue an order approving the bulk phone records component, based on the idea that Section 215 could be interpreted as authorizing bulk collection. Many other judges serving on the FISA court have subsequently renewed the program at roughly 90-day intervals. It came to light in June 2013 as part of the leaks by the intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden. The revelation led to a series of lawsuits challenging the program. Different district court judges reached opposing conclusions about its legality. Thursday’s ruling did not address the A.C.L.U.’s separate argument that bulk collection of records about Americans is unconstitutional regardless of any laws that support it."}

Patient confidentiality? Personal data protection? Presumption of innocence? Apparently, for the National Police these are just empty words, but not the inherent principles of their daily law-enforcement efforts. The society has just started forgetting the brilliant idea of Illia Kiva to introduce criminal responsibility for using drugs, so the Department of Countering Drug-Related Crime decided to remind about itself by starting to collect data about all patients of drug treatment clinics due to the operational needs to create a database of individuals who use narcotic drugs for non-medical purposes. [1] Since January 2016, the Alliance for Public Health has been receiving information from the regions of Ukraine on the national policemen illegally collecting information about drug dependent individuals, allegedly as instructed by administration of the National Police of Ukraine. Until recently, there were no documented evidence of the existence of such instructions, but our partners on a regular basis informed us about the cases of visits by law enforcers to treatment institutions offering Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST), mass detention of dozens of drug dependent patients right in the territory of such medical institutions, in particular in Sloviansk, Lysychansk and other cities of Ukraine. But one of these days Alliance got a documented proof of the existence of centralized instructions from the Department of Countering Drug-Related Crime of the National Police to collect personal data of all people registered with drug treatment centers – request of the First Territorial Administration (covering Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Zakarpattia oblasts) of the Department of Countering Drug-Related Crime, reference number 196/40-TU/Z-2016 dated 19.05.2016 to the chief doctor of Zakarpattia oblast drug treatment center. This fact is an evident proof of the National Police unduly initiating centralized collection of personal information on drug dependent individuals in breach of articles 19 and 32 of the Constitution of Ukraine, articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, article 286 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, articles 7, 19, 24, 25 of the Law of Ukraine On Protection of Personal Data, articles 39-1 and 40 of the Law of Ukraine Fundamentals of Healthcare Legislation of Ukraine, and articles 7, 8, 25-28 of the Law of Ukraine On the National Police. Such impudent and systematic violation of human rights is intolerable in a law-governed democratic state, which, besides, is declaring rigorous compliance with the strict conditions of personal data protection, stipulated by the Action Plan on Visa Liberalization by European Union for Ukraine. The Alliance for Public Health would like to draw the attention of all responsible persons – chief law enforcement officers, Ministry of Health, Ombudsman of Ukraine, heads of the special committees of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, other government officials as well as representatives of civil society and media – and today it officially called to immediately intervene with this situation, stop the unlawful collection of information on drug dependent individuals and initiate a complex investigation (criminal proceedings, internal investigations, etc.) based on this fact to avoid such cases in future. At the same time, Alliance would like to bring to notice of administrations of the treatment facilities, where almost 85,000 drugs users are registered, that disclosure of personal information, in particular containing patients’ confidential data, in response to such unlawful requests is unacceptable. For information: The Alliance for Public Health as one of co-implementers of the National Targeted Social Program of Combating HIV/AIDS in 2014-2018 approved with the Law of Ukraine No. 1708-VII dd. 20.10.2014 is responsible for implementing HIV prevention programs, which cover over 212,000 drug dependent people in our country, including more than 8,600 patients of Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). At the end of 2014, in drug treatment institutions of Ukraine there were 84,739 officially registered individualswith mental and behavioral disorders caused by drug abuse.

Security analytics startup SourceDNA told Ars Technica that it is the first time it has found apps live in the App Store that are violating user privacy by pulling data from private APIs. The situation represents a significant issue for Apple which usually operates a tight vetting process and a strict privacy policy regarding personal data collection.Chinese mobile ad provider Youmi developed the software for the apps in question and SourceDNA estimates that a million people, mostly in China, have downloaded the apps in total. In response the findings Apple released the following statement: We’ve identified a group of apps that are using a third-party advertising SDK, developed by Youmi, a mobile advertising provider, that uses private APIs to gather private information, such as user email addresses and device identifiers, and route data to its company server. This is a violation of our security and privacy guidelines. The apps using Youmi’s SDK will be removed from the App Store and any new apps submitted to the App Store using this SDK will be rejected. We are working closely with developers to help them get updated versions of their apps that are safe for customers and in compliance with our guidelines back in the App Store quickly. The discovery comes just a week after Apple removed several apps that had the ability to spy on encrypted traffic."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":20,"title":"Google cleared of illegally collecting smartphone location data in Korea","class":0,"body":"Google and Korean Internet search specialists Daum have been cleared of suspicions that they were illegally collecting location data on locations of smartphone users in the country. Yonhap News reports that the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office reached its decision on Friday, after finding that although both companies did collect location data from their users, it was only related to the specific global position of the user and did not identify them in any way. Speaking to the Korean news outlet, one of the prosecutors said that it was difficult to use a smartphone owner’s IP address as information as they move around, suggesting that the GPS coordinates of a user would be permitted as long as they did not also obtain personal information. The move came seven months after police raided the local office of Google Inc. to secure hard drives and other computer data related to the company’s AdMob platform. In May, police also conducted a similar raid on the headquarters of local portal site Daum. Google was accused of using its AdMob platform to collect data on smartphone users in Korea, utilising its advertising platform to capture data from within third-party Android apps. It was thought that the search giant was able to obtain a user’s location, names of wireless networks they use and their signal density, sending the information back to its servers. The search giant is also in hot water over claims it blocked search rivals from including third-party applications on their Android handsets. In fact, the company premises in the Korean capital were searched during September as the KFTC investigated similar mobile-related complaints from NHN — the organisation behind leading search engine Naver — and Daum, which is Korea’s second largest search firm (yes, the same company that was cleared of capturing user data on Friday). The duo accused Google of banning all South Korean phone manufacturers from including third-party search applications under its marketing contract as well as delaying the certification of handset makers that violated the condition."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":21,"title":"Facebook lawsuit calls collection of biometrics data illegal","class":0,"body":"A new class action suit against Facebook alleges that the social media giant violated its users’ privacy rights to acquire the largest privately held database of facial recognition data in the world, according to a report by Courthouse News Service.Lead plaintiff Carlo Licata, represented by attorney Jay Edelson, claims that Facebook first began violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy act of 2008 in 2010, in a purported attempt to make the process of tagging friends easier.The lawsuit, recently filed in Cook County Court, relates to Facebook’s tag suggestions program, which scans users’ uploaded pictures and identifies any Facebook friends they may potentially want to tag.The facial recognition technology is taken from Israeli firm Face.com, which Facebook eventually acquired. The lawsuit argues that this method of data mining directly violates users’ privacy laws, describing the facial recognition feature as a brazen disregard for its users’ privacy rights, through which Facebook has secretly amassed the world’s largest privately held database of consumer biometrics data.The tagging feature works by scanning the faces of Facebook friends in photos and extracting facial feature data to cross-match it against their faceprint database, or what the company refers to as templates. However, Licata’s lawsuit alleges that Facebook actively conceals this information from its user base, and doesn’t disclose its wholesale biometrics data collection practices in its privacy policies, nor does it even ask users to acknowledge them – a practice that is illegal in Illinois.According to the Illinois Biometrics Information Privacy Act, it is unlawful to acquire biometric data without first providing the subject with a written disclaimer that details the purpose and length of the data collection, and without the subject’s written consent. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission also backs this same sentiment by suggesting that private companies should provide clear notice of how the technology works, what data they are collecting and for what reasons, and attain consent from the subject, before using biometric data. The lawsuit alleges that Facebook automatically enrolled its users into its facial recognition program to collect their biometric identifiers-a practice that continues to this day, as well as being calculatedly elusive in describing how the program works.At a 2012 Senate hearing on biometric technology, Facebook privacy and public policy manager Robert Sherman said that the tag suggestions program is simply a convenience feature and assured the Senate that users’ data is secure . He also added that Facebook’s faceprint database works only with its own software, and alone, the templates are useless bits of data. The lawsuit also states that in 2011 the FTC was concerned about a third party maliciously breaching a database of biometric information, and that once exposed, a victim has no recourse to prevent becoming victim to misconduct like identity theft and unauthorized tracking. Finally, the lawsuit seeks class certification and an injunction ordering Facebook to comply with the Illinois law, to put a stop to its surreptitious collection, use and storage of users’ biometric data. In an email statement, a Facebook spokesperson called the lawsuit without merit, and stated that the company will defend [itself] vigorously. The statement also said that the face-tagging feature could be disabled, which deletes the data used to suggest tags to other people."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":22,"title":"Cellphone data spying: It's not just the NSA","class":0,"body":"The National Security Agency isn't the only government entity secretly collecting data from people's cellphones. Local police are increasingly scooping it up, too. Armed with new technologies, including mobile devices that tap into cellphone data in real time, dozens of local and state police agencies are capturing information about thousands of cellphone users at a time, whether they are targets of an investigation or not, according to public records obtained by USA TODAY and Gannett  ewspapers and TV stations. The records, from more than 125 police agencies in 33 states, reveal:• About one in four law-enforcement agencies have used a tactic known as a tower dump, which gives police data about the identity, activity and location of any phone that connects to the targeted cellphone towers over a set span of time, usually an hour or two. A typical dump covers multiple towers, and wireless providers, and can net information from thousands of phones. • At least 25 police departments own a Stingray, a suitcase-size device that costs as much as $400,000 and acts as a fake cell tower. The system, typically installed in a vehicle so it can be moved into any neighborhood, tricks all nearby phones into connecting to it and feeding data to police. In some states, the devices are available to any local police department via state surveillance units. The federal government funds most of the purchases, via anti-terror grants.The National Security Agency isn't the only government entity secretly collecting data from people's cellphones. Police are increasingly scooping it up, too.VPC• Thirty-six more police agencies refused to say whether they've used either tactic. Most denied public records requests, arguing that criminals or terrorists could use the information to thwart important crime-fighting and surveillance techniques.Police maintain that cellphone data can help solve crimes, track fugitives or abducted children or even foil a terror attack.Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Privacy Information enter (EPIC) say the swelling ability by even small-town police departments to easily and quickly obtain large amounts of cellphone data raises questions about the erosion of people's privacy as well as their Fourth Amendment protections against nreasonable search and seizure.I don't think that these devices should never be used, but at the same time, you should clearly be getting a warrantALAN BUTLER OF EPICI don't think that these devices should never be used, but at the same time, you should clearly be getting a warrant, said Alan Butler of EPIC.In most states, police can get many kinds of cellphone data without obtaining a warrant, which they'd need to search someone's house or car. Privacy advocates, legislators and courts are debating the legal standards with increasing intensity as technology — and the amount of sensitive information people entrust to their devices — evolves.VAST DATA NETMany people aren't aware that a smartphone is an adept location-tracking device. It's constantly sending signals to nearby cell towers, even when it's not being used. And wireless carriers store data about your device, from where it's been to whom you've called and texted, some of it for years. The power for police is alluring: a vast data net that can be a cutting-edge crime-fighting tool. In October 2012, in Colorado, a 10-year-old girl vanished while she walked to school. Volunteers scoured Westminster looking for Jessica Ridgeway. Local police took a clandestine tack. They got a court order for data about every cellphone that connected to five providers' towers on the girl's route. Later, they asked for 15 more cellphone site data dumps. Colorado authorities won't divulge how many people's data they obtained, but testimony in other cases indicates it was at least several thousand people's phones. The court orders in the Colorado case show police got cellular telephone numbers, including the date, time and duration of any calls, as well as numbers and location data for all phones that connected to the towers searched, whether calls were being made or not. Police and court records obtained by USA TODAY about cases across the country show that's standard for a tower dump. The tower dump data helped police choose about 500 people who were asked to submit DNA samples. The broad cell-data sweep and DNA samples didn't solve the crime, though the information aided in the prosecution. A 17-year-old man's mother tipped off the cops, and the man confessed to kidnapping and dismembering the girl, hiding some of her remains in a crawl space in his mother's house. He pleaded guilty and last month was sentenced to more than 100 years in prison. Not every use of the tower dumps involved stakes so high. We had to find out as much information as we could.Richland County (S.C) Sheriff Leon Lott ordered four cell-data dumps from two towers in a 2011 investigation into a rash of car break-ins near Columbia, including the theft of collection of guns and rifles from his police-issued SUV, parked at his home. We were looking at someone who was breaking into a lot of vehicles and was not going to stop, Lott said. So, we had to find out as much information as we could. The sheriff's office says it has used a tower dump in at least one prior case, to help solve a murder. Law-enforcement records show police can use initial data from a tower dump to ask for another court order for more information, including addresses, billing records and logs of calls, texts and locations. Cellphone data sweeps fit into a broadening effort by police to collect and mine information about people's activities and movements. Police can harvest data about motorists by mining toll-road payments, red-light cameras and license-plate readers. Cities are installing cameras in public areas, some with facial-recognition capabilities, as well as Wi-Fi networks that can record the location and other details about any connecting device. SECRET STINGRAYS Local and state police, from Florida to Alaska, are buying Stingrays with federal grants aimed at protecting cities from terror attacks, but using them for far broader police work. With the mobile Stingray, police can get a court order to grab some of the same data available via a tower dump with two added benefits. The Stingray can grab some data from cellphones in real time and without going through the wireless service providers involved. Neither tactic — tower dumps or the Stingray devices — captures the content of calls or other communication, according to police. Typically used to hunt a single phone's location, the system intercepts data from all phones within a mile, or farther, depending on terrain and antennas. The cell-tracking systems cost as much as $400,000, depending on when they were bought and what add-ons they have. The latest upgrade, code-named Hailstorm, is spurring a wave of upgrade requests. Initially developed for military and spy agencies, the Stingrays remain a guarded secret by law enforcement and the manufacturer, Harris Corp. of Melbourne, Fla. The company would not answer questions about the systems, referring reporters to police agencies. Most police aren't talking, either, partly because Harris requires buyers to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Any idea of having adequate oversight of the use of these devices is hampered by secrecy, says Butler, who sued the FBI for records about its Stingray systems. Under court order, the FBI released thousands of pages, though most of the text is blacked out. When this technology disseminates down to local government and local police, there are not the same accountability mechanisms in place. You can see incredible potential for abuses, American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Catherine Crump says. PRIVACY CONCERNS Crump and other privacy advocates pose questions such as Is data about people who are not police targets saved or shared with other government agencies? and What if a tower dump or Stingray swept up cell numbers and identities of people at a political protest? When Miami-Dade police bought their Stingray device, they told the City Council the agency needed to monitor protesters at an upcoming world trade conference, according to purchasing records. Most of the police agencies that would talk about the tactics said they're not being used for intelligence gathering, only in search of specific targets. Lott, the sheriff in the South Carolina gun-theft case, said police weren't interested in seeing data about the other residents whose information was collected as a byproduct of his agency's tower dumps. We're not infringing on their rights, Lott said. When they use that phone, they understand that information is going to go to a tower. We're not taking that information and using it for any means whatsoever, unless they're the bad guy or unless they're the victim. Brian Owsley, a former magistrate who reviewed many police requests for bulk cellphone data, grew skeptical because authorities were not always forthcoming about the technology or what happened with collateral data of innocent bystanders. What is the government doing with the data? asks Owsley, now a law professor at Texas Tech University. What is the government doing with the data? BRIAN OWSLEY, LAW PROFESSOR AT TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY Surveillance regulation is being tinkered with piecemeal by courts and legislators. This year, Montana and Maine passed laws requiring police to show probable cause and get a search warrant to access some cellphone data, as they would to search a car or home. State and federal courts have handed down seemingly contradictory rulings about which cellphone data is private or not. Seattle's City Council requires police to notify the council of new surveillance technology deployed in the city. We have to be careful because Americans deserve an expectation of privacy, and the courts are mixed right now as to what is an expectation of privacy when using a cellphone, says U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., who says Congress needs to clarify the law. More and more, we're seeing an invasion of what we would expect to be private parts of our lives. Legislative and judicial guidance is needed to match police surveillance rules to today's technology, says Wayne Holmes, a prosecutor for two Central Florida counties. He has weighed frequent local police requests for tower dumps and Stingray surveillance. The clearer the law, the better the law is. Americans are sensitized right now to cellphone surveillance because of reports about potential abuses by the NSA, said Washoe County Sheriff Michael Haley of Reno. He is opting not to use the Stingray. I'm being cautious about how I access information, because at the end of the day I know that I will be in court if I access information using systems and techniques that are not constitutionally vetted, Haley said."}

The Information Commissioner’s Office today demanded the US web firm deletes immediately all discs containing the information. And Britain’s privacy watchdog gave Google 35 days to abide by its ruling or face being in contempt of court, which is a criminal offence. The company had harvested information, such as email addresses and passwords, from open wi-fi networks using its fleet of Street View cars that builds its Google Maps product.Google had pledged to destroy the illegally held data but admitted last year it accidentally kept four discs. The watchdog found the additional discs had been held in quarantine cages and had not been accessed. But the ICO ordered the company to flag immediately if it found any further Street View discs with personal data. Stephen Eckersley, the watchdog’s head of enforcement, said: Google Street View should be an example of what can go wrong if technology companies fail to understand how their products are using personal information. Google admitted in 2010 it had hoarded information from unsecured wireless networks as its vehicles roamed residential streets to create its popular maps. In November 2010, the ICO ordered Google to destroy all data obtained in this way but in February 2012 the company discovered further discs that had not been deleted. The watchdog then reopened its investigation after a report by America’s Federal Communications Commission found an engineer deliberately wrote the software to capture the information. But despite today’s damning verdict, the ICO sparked anger by refusing to hit Google with a fine. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: Google collected information it was not entitled to, infringing people’s privacy on a huge scale, then said it had deleted the data when it had not. The basis of privacy law is that companies don’t collect information without permission. This episode is worryingly close to severely undermining this principle and setting a precedent that companies can collect data illegally and not face any action if they promise to delete it later on. People will rightly look at the UK’s approach to this issue and ask why, given that regulators in the US, Germany and other countries have fined Google for the same infringement, it is being allowed to escape with a slap on the wrist in Britain. A Google spokesman said: We work hard to get privacy right at Google – but in this case we didn’t, which is why we quickly tightened up our systems to address the issue. The project leaders never wanted this data and didn’t even look at it.We co-operated fully with the ICO and having received its order we are proceeding with our plan to delete the data. * Take a look at some of the weird and wonderful images picked up by Google Street View cameras below."}

The incident derailed an important summit meeting between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that was scheduled for later that month. The U-2 spy plane was the brainchild of the Central Intelligence Agency, and it was a sophisticated technological marvel. Traveling at altitudes of up to 70,000 feet, the aircraft was equipped with state-of-the-art photography equipment that could, the CIA boasted, take high-resolution pictures of headlines in Russian newspapers as it flew overhead. Flights over the Soviet Union began in mid-1956. The CIA assured President Eisenhower that the Soviets did not possess anti-aircraft weapons sophisticated enough to shoot down the high-altitude planes. On May 1, 1960, a U-2 flight piloted by Francis Gary Powers disappeared while on a flight over Russia. The CIA reassured the president that, even if the plane had been shot down, it was equipped with self-destruct mechanisms that would render any wreckage unrecognizable and the pilot was instructed to kill himself in such a situation. Based on this information, the U.S. government issued a cover statement indicating that a weather plane had veered off course and supposedly crashed somewhere in the Soviet Union. With no small degree of pleasure, Khrushchev pulled off one of the most dramatic moments of the Cold War by producing not only the mostly-intact wreckage of the U-2, but also the captured pilot-very much alive. A chagrined Eisenhower had to publicly admit that it was indeed a U.S. spy plane. On May 16, a major summit between the United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and France began in Paris. Issues to be discussed included the status of Berlin and nuclear arms control. As the meeting opened, Khrushchev launched into a tirade against the United States and Eisenhower and then stormed out of the summit. The meeting collapsed immediately and the summit was called off. Eisenhower considered the stupid U-2 mess one of the worst debacles of his presidency. The pilot, Francis Gary Powers, was released in 1962 in exchange for a captured Soviet spy."}

Austria demands clarification, Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said. German media, quoting leaked documents, said European firms and French politicians were among those monitored. It said Germany's national intelligence agency, the BND, was working on behalf of the US National Security Agency. Ms Mikl-Leitner said there was no evidence yet it had been a target, but warned it was not far-fetched to suspect that Austria was also spied on. Today we have filed a legal complaint with the prosecutor's office against an unknown entity due to secret intelligence services to Austria's disadvantage, she said. 'Just not done' There was outrage in Germany after the huge scale of National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance - together with that of the UK's surveillance agency, GCHQ - was revealed in 2013 by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. In the latest revelations, German reports said the Bad Aibling listening post in Bavaria was used by the BND to spy on the French presidential palace, French foreign ministry and European Commission. The German newspaper, Bild am Sonntag, said the BND also spied on Austrian federal agencies using search terms provided by the NSA. The agency also reportedly collected information at Washington's behest on European firms including Airbus and Eurocopter - now known as Airbus Helicopters - to check if they were breaking trade embargoes. The German government has come under pressure to reveal how much it knew about the alleged espionage and disclose a list of spying targets given to German intelligence by the US. Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose own mobile phone conversations were allegedly snooped on by the NSA, has defended the BND, saying intelligence agencies had to co-operate with their foreign counterparts to combat international terror threats. The reports are likely to cause embarrassment for the chancellor. In 2013, when she was the target of US spying, she admonished the Americans with the words: Spying between friends, that's just not done. Mrs Merkel grew up in East Germany, where citizens were routinely spied on by their own government. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has meanwhile denied having had any knowledge of German intelligence malpractice. He was directly responsible for the BND in 2008, when the agency first allegedly informed the chancellery that it was helping the NSA to spy on European aviation, aerospace and defence companies.

Top-secret documents from the archive of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden show the National Security Agency can now automatically recognize the content within phone calls by creating rough transcripts and phonetic representations that can be easily searched and stored. The documents show NSA analysts celebrating the development of what they called Google for Voice nearly a decade ago. Though perfect transcription of natural conversation apparently remains the Intelligence Community’s holy grail, the Snowden documents describe extensive use of keyword searching as well as computer programs designed to analyze and extract the content of voice conversations, and even use sophisticated algorithms to flag conversations of interest. The documents include vivid examples of the use of speech recognition in war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in Latin America. But they leave unclear exactly how widely the spy agency uses this ability, particularly in programs that pick up considerable amounts of conversations that include people who live in or are citizens of the United States. Spying on international telephone calls has always been a staple of NSA surveillance, but the requirement that an actual person do the listening meant it was effectively limited to a tiny percentage of the total traffic. By leveraging advances in automated speech recognition, the NSA has entered the era of bulk listening. And this has happened with no apparent public oversight, hearings or legislative action. Congress hasn’t shown signs of even knowing that it’s going on. The USA Freedom Act — the surveillance reform bill that Congress is currently debating — doesn’t address the topic at all. The bill would end an NSA program that does not collect voice content: the government’s bulk collection of domestic calling data, showing who called who and for how long. Even if becomes law, the bill would leave in place a multitude of mechanisms exposed by Snowden that scoop up vast amounts of innocent people’s text and voice communications in the U.S. and across the globe. Civil liberty experts contacted by The Intercept said the NSA’s speech-to-text capabilities are a disturbing example of the privacy invasions that are becoming possible as our analog world transitions to a digital one. I think people don’t understand that the economics of surveillance have totally changed, Jennifer Granick, civil liberties director at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, told The Intercept. Once you have this capability, then the question is: How will it be deployed? Can you temporarily cache all American phone calls, transcribe all the phone calls, and do text searching of the content of the calls? she said. It may not be what they are doing right now, but they’ll be able to do it. And, she asked: How would we ever know if they change the policy? Indeed, NSA officials have been secretive about their ability to convert speech to text, and how widely they use it, leaving open any number of possibilities. That secrecy is the key, Granick said. We don’t have any idea how many innocent people are being affected, or how many of those innocent people are also Americans. I Can Search Against It NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake, who was trained as a voice processing crypto-linguist and worked at the agency until 2008, told The Intercept that he saw a huge push after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks to turn the massive amounts of voice communications being collected into something more useful. Human listening was clearly not going to be the solution. There weren’t enough ears, he said. The transcripts that emerged from the new systems weren’t perfect, he said. But even if it’s not 100 percent, I can still get a lot more information. It’s far more accessible. I can search against it. Converting speech to text makes it easier for the NSA to see what it has collected and stored, according to Drake. The breakthrough was being able to do it on a vast scale, he said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":29,"title":"Snowden documents reveal how the NSA searches voice calls","class":0,"body":"The Intercept has released a new document from Edward Snowden's cache of government files describing how the NSA has been converting voice calls to searchable text documents for nearly a decade. The NSA has long monitored signals intelligence (SIGNIT) around the world (as is its primary function), especially in active combat zones like Afghanistan and Iraq as well as in Latin America. Traditionally, this sort of data gathering required that a live operator listen in on calls and translate them in real-time. However, the NSA has reportedly developed what it calls Google for Voice; an automated system that provides a rough but keyword searchable transcription. According to the documents, the NSA has also developed analytical programs and sophisticated algorithms to flag conversations for human review. What's more, these do so on an automated and industrial scale, allowing the NSA to monitor larger amounts of the total SIGNIT traffic within a given region. Granted, these transcriptions aren't perfect -- they're pretty rough in fact -- but as NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake explained to The Intercept, But even if it's not 100 percent, I can still get a lot more information.

{"id":30,"title":"NSA PLANNED TO HIJACK GOOGLE APP STORE TO HACK SMARTPHONES","class":0,"body":"The National Security Agency and its closest allies planned to hijack data links to Google and Samsung app stores to infect smartphones with spyware, a top-secret document reveals. The surveillance project was launched by a joint electronic eavesdropping unit called the Network Tradecraft Advancement Team, which includes spies from each of the countries in the Five Eyes alliance — the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. The top-secret document, obtained from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, was published Wednesday by CBC News in collaboration with The Intercept. The document outlines a series of tactics that the NSA and its counterparts in the Five Eyes were working on during workshops held in Australia and Canada between November 2011 and February 2012. The main purpose of the workshops was to find new ways to exploit smartphone technology for surveillance. The agencies used the Internet spying system XKEYSCORE to identify smartphone traffic flowing across Internet cables and then to track down smartphone connections to app marketplace servers operated by Samsung and Google. (Google declined to comment for this story. Samsung said it would not be commenting at this time.) As part of a pilot project codenamed IRRITANT HORN, the agencies were developing a method to hack and hijack phone users’ connections to app stores so that they would be able to send malicious implants to targeted devices. The implants could then be used to collect data from the phones without their users noticing. Previous disclosures from the Snowden files have shown agencies in the Five Eyes alliance designed spyware for iPhones and Android smartphones, enabling them to infect targeted phones and grab emails, texts, web history, call records, videos, photos and other files stored on them. But methods used by the agencies to get the spyware onto phones in the first place have remained unclear. The newly published document shows how the agencies wanted to exploit app store servers — using them to launch so-called man-in-the-middle attacks to infect phones with the implants. A man-in-the-middle attack is a technique in which hackers place themselves between computers as they are communicating with each other; it is a tactic sometimes used by criminal hackers to defraud people. In this instance, the method would have allowed the surveillance agencies to modify the content of data packets passing between targeted smartphones and the app servers while an app was being downloaded or updated, inserting spyware that would be covertly sent to the phones. But the agencies wanted to do more than just use app stores as a launching pad to infect phones with spyware. They were also keen to find ways to hijack them as a way of sending selective misinformation to the targets’ handsets as part of so-called effects operations that are used to spread propaganda or confuse adversaries. Moreover, the agencies wanted to gain access to companies’ app store servers so they could secretly use them for harvesting information about phone users. The project was motivated in part by concerns about the possibility of another Arab Spring, which was sparked in Tunisia in December 2010 and later spread to countries across the Middle East and North Africa. Western governments and intelligence agencies were largely blindsided by those events, and the document detailing IRRITANT HORN suggests the spies wanted to be prepared to launch surveillance operations in the event of more unrest. The agencies were particularly interested in the African region, focusing on Senegal, Sudan and the Congo. But the app stores targeted were located in a range of countries, including a Google app store server located in France and other companies’ app download servers in Cuba, Morocco, Switzerland, Bahamas, the Netherlands and Russia. (At the time, the Google app store was called the Android Market; it is now named Google Play.) Another major outcome of the secret workshops was the agencies’ discovery of privacy vulnerabilities in UC Browser, a popular app used to browse the Internet across Asia, particularly in China and India. Though UC Browser is not well-known in Western countries, its massive Asian user base, a reported half billion people, means it is one of the most popular mobile Internet browsers in the world. According to the top-secret document, the agencies discovered that the UC Browser app was leaking a gold mine of identifying information about its users’ phones. Some of the leaking information apparently helped the agencies uncover a communication channel linked to a foreign military unit believed to be plotting covert activities in Western countries. The discovery was celebrated by the spies as an opportunity where potentially none may have existed before. Citizen Lab, a human rights and technology research group based at the University of Toronto, analyzed the Android version of the UC Browser app for CBC News and said it identified major security and privacy issues in its English and Chinese editions. The Citizen Lab researchers have authored their own detailed technical report outlining the many ways the app has been leaking data, including some users’ search queries, SIM card numbers and unique device IDs that can be used to track people. Citizen Lab alerted UC Browser to the security gaps in mid-April; the company says it has now fixed them by rolling out an update for the app. A spokesperson for UC Browser’s parent company, Chinese e-commerce giantthe Alibaba Group, told CBC News in a statement that it took security very seriously and we do everything possible to protect our users. The spokesperson added that the company had found no evidence that any user information has been taken — though it is not likely that surveillance of the leaking data would have been detectable. The case strikes at the heart of a debate about whether spy agencies are putting ordinary people at risk by secretly exploiting security flaws in popular software instead of reporting them so that they can be fixed. According to Citizen Lab Director Ron Deibert, the UC Browser vulnerability not only exposed millions of the app’s users to surveillance carried out by any number of governments — but it could also have been exploited by criminal hackers to harvest personal data. Of course, the security agencies don’t [disclose the information], Deibert said. Instead, they harbor the vulnerability. They essentially weaponize it. Taking advantage of weaknesses in apps like UC Browser may make sense from a very narrow national security mindset, Deibert added, but it’s at the expense of the privacy and security of hundreds of millions of users worldwide. The revelations are the latest to highlight tactics adopted by the Five Eyes agencies in their efforts to hack computers and exploit software vulnerabilities for surveillance. Last year, The Intercept reported that the NSA has worked with its partners to dramatically increase the scope of its hacking attacks and use of implants to infect computers. In some cases, the agency was shown to have masqueraded as a Facebook server in order to hack into computers. The Intercept and CBC News contacted each of the Five Eyes agencies for comment on this story, but none would answer questions on record about any of the specific details. A spokesperson for Canada’s Communications Security Establishment said that the agency was mandated to collect foreign signals intelligence to protect Canada and Canadians from a variety of threats to our national security, including terrorism, adding that it does not direct its foreign signals intelligence activities at Canadians or anywhere in Canada. British agency Government Communications Headquarters said that its work was carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate. Australia’s Signals Directorate said it was long-standing practice not to discuss intelligence matters and would not comment further. New Zealand’s Government Communications Security Bureau said that it has a foreign intelligence mandate and that everything it does is explicitly authorised and subject to independent oversight. The NSA had not responded to repeated requests for comment at time of publication."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":31,"title":"Chrome extensions will soon have to tell you what data they collect","class":0,"body":"New rules mean no more sneaky collection of user data without prominent notifications Google is about to make it harder for Chrome extensions to collect your browsing data without letting you know about it, according to a new policy announced Friday. Starting in mid-July, developers releasing Chrome extensions will have to comply with a new User Data Policy that governs how they collect, transmit and store private information. Extensions will have to encrypt personal and sensitive information, and developers will have to disclose their privacy policies to users. Developers will also have to post a prominent disclosure when collecting sensitive data that isn't related to a prominent feature. That's important, because extensions have tremendous power to track users' browsing habits and then use that for nefarious purposes. With this change, an extension that's marketed as a way to add themes to social media sites but also scrapes the number of friends a user has on that site for sale or research purposes will have to prominently tell users about it. By requiring developers to be up front about what they might be collecting behind the scenes, Google can help make sure that its users are protected from shady extensions, and make sure that people know how their information is being used. However, users shouldn't expect prominent disclosures for every piece of information collected. For example, Google allows developers to collect anonymized data about how people use their extensions without a prominent disclosure (though it should be represented in their privacy policies). Google has given developers until July 14 to update their extensions to comply with the new policy. After that, extensions that don't follow Google's new guidelines will be removed from the Chrome Web Store."}

That’s the bottom line of a Federal Communications Commission vote Thursday that split 3-2 along party lines, with a Democratic majority. The vote affirms a broad reclassification of broadband providers like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon as common carriers, much like long-distance telephone companies. The ruling will make it difficult for ISPs to build advertising or data businesses based on tracking user web surfing or behavior because in many markets they are monopolies and deemed to play too vital a role in accessing the internet. By contrast, web companies like Google, Facebook, AOL and thousands of advertising technology companies may continue to collect data unless users opt out.There’s one indisputable fact, and that’s it’s the consumer’s information, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said. Comcast Senior Executive Vice President David Cohenargued the ruling will not provide meaningful consumer internet privacy protections, and will block ISPs from bringing competition to the online advertising market that would benefit consumers. Indeed, the online ad marketplace is increasingly dominated by two companies: Google and Facebook, and, as Comcast pointed out, the top 10 players in online advertising control 70 percent of the market, and none of those companies is an ISP. One of those companies — AOL — is owned by Verizon. Privacy and open-internet advocates applauded the decision. By virtue of their position, ISPs have near-unfettered access to our internet traffic, allowing them to build comprehensive profiles of their users by surveilling the websites they visit and tracking services they use online, Free Press Policy Counsel Gaurav Laroia said in a statement."}

{"id":34,"title":"FAQ: What You Need to Know About the NSA’s Surveillance Programs","class":0,"body":"What information does the NSA collect and how? We don’t know all of the different types of information the NSA collects, but several secret collection programs have been revealed: A record of most calls made in the U.S., including the telephone number of the phones making and receiving the call, and how long the call lasted. This information is known as metadata and doesn’t include a recording of the actual call (but see below). This program was revealed through a leaked secret court order instructing Verizon to turn over all such information on a daily basis. Other phone companies, including AT&T and Sprint, also reportedly give their records to the NSA on a continual basis. All together, this is several billion calls per day. Email, Facebook posts and instant messages for an unknown number of people, via PRISM, which involves the cooperation of at least nine different technology companies. Google, Facebook, Yahoo and others have denied that the NSA has direct access to their servers, saying they only release user information in response to a court order. Facebook has revealed that, in the last six months of 2012, they handed over the private data of between 18,000 and 19,000 users to law enforcement of all types -- including local police and federal agencies, such as the FBI, Federal Marshals and the NSA. Massive amounts of raw Internet traffic The NSA intercepts huge amounts of raw data, and stores billions of communication records per day in its databases. Using the NSA’s XKEYSCORE software, analysts can see nearly everything a user does on the Internet including emails, social media posts, web sites you visit, addresses typed into Google Maps, files sent, and more. Currently the NSA is only authorized to intercept Internet communications with at least one end outside the U.S., though the domestic collection program used to be broader. But because there is no fully reliable automatic way to separate domestic from international communications, this program also captures some amount of U.S. citizens’ purely domestic Internet activity, such as emails, social media posts, instant messages, the sites you visit and online purchases you make. The contents of an unknown number of phone calls There have been severalreports that the NSA records the audio contents of some phone calls and a leaked document confirms this. This reportedly happens on a much smaller scale than the programs above, after analysts select specific people as targets. Calls to or from U.S. phone numbers can be recorded, as long as the other end is outside the U.S. or one of the callers is involved in international terrorism. There does not seem to be any public information about the collection of text messages, which would be much more practical to collect in bulk because of their smaller size. The NSA has been prohibited from recording domestic communications since thepassage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act but at least two of these programs -- phone records collection and Internet cable taps -- involve huge volumes of Americans’ data. Does the NSA record everything about everyone, all the time? The NSA records as much information as it can, subject to technical limitations (there’s alot of data) and legal constraints. This currently includes the metadata for nearly all telephone calls made in the U.S. (but not their content) and massive amounts of Internet traffic with at least one end outside the U.S. It’s not clear exactly how many cables have been tapped, though we know of at least one inside the U.S., a secret report about the program by the NSA’s Inspector General mentions multiple cables, and the volume of intercepted information is so large that it was processed at 150 sites around the world as of 2008. We also know that Britain’s GCHQ, which shares some intelligence with the NSA, had tapped over 200 cables as of 2012, belonging to seven different telecommunications companies.    Until 2011 the NSA also operated a domestic Internet metadata program which collectedmass records of who emailed who even if both parties were inside the U.S. Because it is not always possible to separate domestic from foreign communications by automatic means, the NSA still captures some amount of purely domestic information, and it is allowed to do so by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The collected information covers nearly everything a user does on the Internet, according to a presentation on the XKEYSCORE system. The slides specifically mention emails, Facebook chats, websites visited, Google Maps searches, transmitted files, photographs, and documents of different kinds. It’s also possible to search for people based on where they are connecting from, the language they use, or their use of privacy technologies such as VPNs and encryption, according to the slides. This is a massive amount of data. The full contents of intercepted Internet traffic can only be stored for up to a few days, depending on the collection site, while the associated metadata (who communicated with whom online) is stored up to 30 days. Telephone metadata is smaller and is stored for five years. NSA analysts can move specific data tomore permanent databases when they become relevant to an investigation. The NSA also collects narrower and more detailed information on specific people, such as the actual audio of phone calls and the entire content of email accounts. NSA analysts can submit a request to obtain these types of more detailed information about specific people.Watching a specific person like this is called targeting by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the law which authorizes this type of individual surveillance. The NSA is allowed to record the conversations of non-Americans without a specific warrant for each person monitored, if at least one end of the conversation is outside of the U.S. It is also allowed to record the communications of Americans if they are outside the U.S. and the NSA first gets a warrant for each case. It’s not known exactly how many people the NSA is currently targeting, but according to a leaked report the NSA intercepted content from 37,664 telephone numbers and email addresses from October 2001 to January 2007. Of these, 8% were domestic: 2,612 U.S. phone numbers and 406 U.S. email addresses. How the NSA actually gets the data depends on the type of information requested. If the analyst wants someone's private emails or social media posts, the NSA must request that specific data from companies such as Google and Facebook. Some technology companies (we don't know which ones) have FBI monitoring equipment installed on the premises and the NSA gets the information via the FBI's Data Intercept Technology Unit. The NSA also has the capability to monitor calls made over the Internet (such as Skype calls) and instant messaging chats as they happen. For information that is already flowing through Internet cables that the NSA is monitoring, or the audio of phone calls, a targeting request instructs automatic systemsto watch for the communications of a specific person and save them. It’s important to note that the NSA probably has information about you even if you aren’t on this target list. If you have previously communicated with someone who has been targeted, then the NSA already has the content of any emails, instant messages, phone calls, etc. you exchanged with the targeted person. Also, your data is likely in bulk records such as phone metadata and Internet traffic recordings. This is what makes these programs mass surveillance, as opposed to traditional wiretaps, which are authorized by individual, specific court orders. What does phone call metadata information reveal, if it doesn’t include the content of the calls? Even without the content of all your conversations and text messages, so-called metadata can reveal a tremendous amount about you. If they have your metadata, the NSA would have a record of your entire address book, or at least every person you’ve called in the last several years. They can guess who you are close to by how often you call someone, and when. By correlating the information from multiple people, they can do sophisticated network analysis  f communities of many different kinds, personal or professional -- or criminal. Phone company call records reveal where you were at the time that a call was made, because they include the identifier of the radio tower that transmitted the call to you. The government has repeatedly denied that it collects this information, but former NSA employee Thomas Drake said they do. For a sense of just how powerful location data can be, see this visualization following a German politician everywhere he goes for months, based on his cellphone’s location information. Even without location data, records of who communicated with whom can be used todiscover the structure of groups planning terrorism. Starting from a known target (see above), analysts typically reconstruct the social network two or three hops out, examining all friends-of-friends, or even friends-of-friends-of-friends, in the search for new targets. This means potentially thousands or millions of people might be examined when investigating a single target. Metadata is a sensitive topic because there is great potential for abuse. While no one has claimed the NSA is doing this, it would be possible to use metadata to algorithmically identify, with some accuracy, members of other types of groups like the Tea Party or Occupy Wall Street, gun owners, undocumented immigrants, etc. An expert in network analysis could start with all of the calls made from the time and place of a protest, and trace the networks of associations out from there. Phone metadata is also not anonymous in any real sense. The NSA already maintains adatabase of the phone numbers of all Americans for use in determining whether someone is a U.S. person (see below), and there are several commercial number-to-name services in any case. Phone records become even more powerful when they are correlated with other types of data, such as social media posts, local police records and credit card purchase information, a process known as intelligence fusion. Does the NSA need an individualized warrant to listen to my calls or look at my emails? It’s complicated, but not in all cases. Leaked court orders set out the minimization procedures that govern what the NSA can do with the domestic information it has intercepted. The NSA is allowed to store this domestic information because of the technical difficulties in separating foreign from domestic communications when large amounts of data are being captured. Another document shows that individual intelligence analysts make the decision to look at previously collected bulk information. They must document their request, but only need approval from their shift coordinator. If the analyst later discovers that they are looking at the communications of a U.S. person, they must destroy the data. However, if the intercepted information is reasonably believed to contain evidence of a crime then the NSA is allowed to turn it over to federal law enforcement. Unless there are other (still secret) restrictions on how the NSA can use this data this means the police might end up with your private communications without ever having to get approval from a judge, effectively circumventing the whole notion of probable cause. This is significant because thousands or millions of people might fall into the extended social network of a single known target, but it is not always possible to determine whether someone is a U.S. person before looking at their data. For example, it’s not usually possible to tell just from someone’s email address, which is why the NSAmaintains a database of known U.S. email addresses and phone numbers. Internal documents state that analysts need only 51% confidence that someone is a non-U.S. person before looking at their data, and if the NSA does not have specific information about someone, that person is presumed to be a non-United States person. Also, the NSA is allowed to provide any of its recorded information to the FBI, if the FBI specifically asks for it. Is all of this legal? Yes, assuming the NSA adheres to the restrictions set out in recently leaked court orders. By definition, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court decides what it is legal for the NSA to do. But this level of domestic surveillance wasn’t always legal, and the NSA's domestic surveillance program has been found to violate legal standards on more than one occasion. The NSA was gradually granted the authority to collect domestic information on a massive scale through a series of legislative changes and court decisions over the decade following September 11, 2001. See this timeline of loosening laws. The Director of National Intelligence says that authority for PRISM programs comes from section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Verizon metadata collection order citessection 215 of the Patriot Act. The author of the Patriot Act disagrees that the act justifies the Verizon metadata collection program.The NSA's broad data collection programs were originally authorized by President Bush on October 4, 2001. The program operated that way for several years, but in March 2004 a Justice Department review declared the bulk Internet metadata program was illegal. President Bush signed an order re-authorizing it anyway. In response, several top Justice Department officials threatened to resign, including acting Attorney General James Comey and FBI director Robert Mueller. Bush backed down, and the Internet metadata program was suspended for several months. By 2007, all aspects of the program were re-authorized by court orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. In 2009, the Justice Department acknowledged that the NSA had collected emails and phone calls of Americans in a way that exceeded legal limitations.In October 2011, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ruled that the NSA violated the Fourth Amendment at least once. The Justice Department has said that this ruling must remain secret, but we know it concerned some aspect of the minimization rules the govern what the NSA can do with domestic communications. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court recently decided that this ruling can be released, but Justice Department has not yet done so. Civil liberties groups including the EFF and the ACLU dispute the constitutionality of these programs and have filed lawsuits to challenge them. How long can the NSA keep information on Americans?The NSA can generally keep intercepted domestic communications for up to five years. It can keep them indefinitely under certain circumstances, such as when the communication contains evidence of a crime or when it’s foreign intelligence information, a broad legal term that includes anything relevant to the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States. The NSA can also keep encrypted communications indefinitely. That includes any information sent to or from a secure web site, that is, a site with a URL starting with https. Does the NSA do anything to protect Americans’ privacy? Yes. First, the NSA is only allowed to intercept communications if at least one end of the conversation is outside of the U.S. -- though it doesn't have to distinguish domestic from foreign communication until the earliest practicable point which allows the NSA to record bulk information from Internet cables and sort it out later. When the NSA discovers that previously intercepted information belongs to an American, it must usually destroy that information. Because this determination cannot always be made by computer, this sometimes happens only after a human analyst has already looked at it. The NSA also must apply certain safeguards. For example, the NSA must withhold the names of U.S. persons who are not relevant to ongoing investigations when they distribute information -- unless that person’s communications contain evidence of a crime or are relevant to a range of national security and foreign intelligence concerns. Also, analysts must document why they believe someone is outside of the U.S. when they ask for addition information to be collected on that person. An unknown number of these cases are audited internally. If the NSA makes a mistake and discovers that it has targeted someone inside the U.S., it has five days to submit a report to the Department of Justice and other authorities.What if I’m not an American? All bets are off. There do not appear to be any legal restrictions on what the NSA can do with the communications of non-U.S. persons. Since a substantial fraction of the world’s Internet data passes through the United States, or its allies, the U.S. has the ability to observe and record the communications of much of the world’s population. The European Union has already complained to the U.S. Attorney General. The U.S. is hardly the only country doing mass surveillance, though its program is very large. GCHQ, which is the British counterpart to the NSA, has a similar surveillance program and shares data with the NSA. Many countries now have some sort of mass Internet surveillance now in place. Although passive surveillance is often hard to detect, more aggressive governments use intercepted information to intimidate or control their citizens, including Syria, Iran, Egypt, Bahrain and China. Much of the required equipment is sold to these governments by American companies."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":35,"title":"No, NSA Phone Spying Has Not Ended","class":0,"body":"At 11:59 P.M. on Saturday night, the U.S. National Security Agency supposedly yanked the cord on its bulk telephone records collection, thereby ending an expansive surveillance program that the nation’s intelligence community put in place in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. There will be no analytic access to the collected metadata after this time, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement. The public learned of the agency’s spying program after Edward Snowden—ex-NSA contractor and whistleblower extraordinaire—leaked information about it to news outlets in 2013. That revelation provoked an uproar among privacy advocates, and Congress eventually reacted by replacing parts of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, which authorized the privacy-invasive program, with a seemingly-less-intrusive piece of legislation, the U.S.A. Freedom Act, over the summer. It would be wrong to conclude, however, that this moment signaled the demise of the agency’s surveillance powers. Rather, the NSA has transitioned to a new system. The reformed scheme addresses the most controversial aspects of the collection program, but questions remain about its implementation. Here’s everything you need to know about the change. What happened at midnight on Saturday? When the clock struck midnight, a 6-month-long orderly transition period for the NSA expired. After the Freedom Act became law in early June, the agency was granted a 180-day grace period to get its affairs in order before putting an end to the bulk phone metadata collection program authorized by a particular portion—Section 215—of the Patriot Act. Under the new guidelines, the NSA no longer may directly collect and hold data about the domestic phone records of U.S. citizens. Instead, telecom companies will retain and access the data on their customers. The NSA may then seek warrants from the secretive courts created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in order to compel these companies to hand over pertinent information on terrorism suspects and affiliates. The requests are not done in bulk, but rather require specific selectors such as the phone number of an individual. The NSA then has up to 180-days to query the telecom companies for more data—on socially connected persons of interest, so-called one-to-two degree hops on their networks—before seeking a renewed authority from a FISA court. There are exceptions to these items though. What kinds of exceptions? Notably, the NSA’s bulk collection database still exists. The agency has requested permission to keep its records for the past five years intact through Feb. 29, 2016. This will ostensibly allow the agency to make sure nothing has gone awry during the transition. Access will be limited to technical personnel and solely for the purpose of verifying that the new targeted production mechanism authorized by the USA FREEDOM Act is working as intended, ODNIsaid in a statement. The database is hands off for analysts. Additionally, it’s worth noting that the NSA must retain these records until all lawsuits regarding the original program are resolved. What’s inside the database? As mentioned, the database contains metadata. It includes information on phone calls such as who, when, and how long—for instance, the identity of the sender and recipient, the duration, and the time and date. Metadata does not include the content of conversations. However, that doesn’t make it any less of a treasure trove for dot-connecting investigators. Why did the NSA need such broad powers to begin with? The agency argued that it needed quick insight about possible terrorists’ networks in case another attack struck. That way the NSA could find out vital intel in emergency situations at the drop of a hat. On the face of it, that capability might seem reasonable. The argument gains support in the wake of the recent terror attacks in Paris as well as other places around the world. An investigation into the success of the program, however, revealed no evidence that the program ever helped in any case. We have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the telephone records program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation,concluded a privacy and civil liberties board set up by the president last year, which reviewed the program’s efficacy (or lack thereof). Plus, privacy advocates have been quick to note the potential for abuse and lack of checks and balances for whomever has access to the database. Will any parts of the old program continue? In addition to the technical extension of the database until Feb. 29, 2016, as mentioned above, there is another quandary. An overlooked clause in a note accompanying the Patriot Act seems to authorize bulk collection indefinitely for ongoing investigations. There’s some debate about what this means exactly, as the New York Times has reported. For instance, does the authority of that supplementary note supersede the Freedom Act? The answer is not immediately clear. Also, do campaigns against al-Qaeda and ISIS qualify as ongoing investigations? And if so, if they drag on—does this then give intelligence agencies carte blanche to continue collecting phone metadata in bulk? Also unclear. Are there any other potential legal loopholes? In fact, yes. An executive order—number 12333—signed originally by Ronald Reagan—could be interpreted to authorize the continuance of bulk collection, so long as it is incidentally collected in the course of a lawful foreign intelligence investigation, as the Washington Post explains. Given the global nature of the world’s telecommunications infrastructure, that capability could easily allow the agency to continue its snooping on just about anyone. The national security blogger Marcy Wheeler recently raised this pointon her site Empty Wheel, suggesting that the agency’s phone metadata dragnet could potentially continue unabated under the earlier authority. By justifying the program through other means, the NSA could find a functional workaround just as it did for its seemingly retired email metadata bulk collection program, Stellarwind. How big a deal is the program’s sunsetting really? The American Civil Liberties Union called the Freedom Act’s passage a milestone. Snowden called it an important step. One of the reasons so much attention has been paid to the bulk collection program for phone metadata is because it represented the first explosive revelation that the Guardian published from Snowden’s files. In that sense, this Saturday marked a significant and tangible victory springing from his leaks. But there is plenty of surveillance still going on. For instance, the NSA continues to collect tremendous amounts of Internet data—a practice that has been slightly less controversial since it focuses on international targets. Of course, the agency almost certainly scoops up domestic data in the process.

{"id":36,"title":"How Are the NSA and Others Collecting and Using our Data? ","class":0,"body":"A metadata expert reveals the sobering implications of personal data collection by governments and companies. Earlier this month, former NSA employee Edward Snowden revealed the agency is collecting data on millions on Americans, from phone call durations to Facebook posts, all through a program codenamed PRISM. The resulting media backlash has revived the debates about internet privacy and government surveillance techniques, but questions remain: how is the National Security Agency taking in the data, and how much of a threat to our civil liberties does such data-collection efforts pose? To find out, Scientific American spoke with metadata expert Mark Herschberg, CTO at Madison Logic and instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Herschberg has worked with the programs used to gather big data and was able to elucidate how our internet data has become an important—if not invasive—commodity. An edited transcript of the interview follows. What kind of software can be used to collect big data? It can be collected a number of different ways. It sounds like the NSA is going into the servers of Facebook and others and accessing their log files through some kind of backdoor. In that case, you can write pretty simple programs that can copy those files and transfer them to local servers. You could also get this data by installing spying software on an individual’s computer. The third option is actually listening through the pipe, the digital version of wiretapping. When an individual downloads something or visits a webpage, all the data go through the Internet service provider. By effectively wiretapping their line, you can see every single byte they're sending back and forth.  Why would the NSA want access to things like Facebook posts? What you can get are signals. For example, if you look at teens committing suicide, they often spend a lot of time thinking about it and planning. There are signs that professionals have been trained to look for, such as saying goodbye to people before they take their own life. Similarly, you might see signals among the bad guys before they're going to do something. They might change their habits. These are things that professionals in counterterrorism can interpret. You can also use personal data to find out where people have been and what they're doing. Photos taken with cellphones contain geotagging information: I can look at a photo that someone has posted and know exactly where that photo was taken. We can also see who is talking to whom and observe important changes. I'll give you an analogy: suppose there's a house, and there's people going in and out. I can't actually see the people going in and out, but I can see the number of cars that pull up to the house. Say I normally see two to three cars a day and I suddenly see 20 cars pull up today. That tells me something is going on. Even if you can't get the detailed information, just looking at changes in communication patterns can alert you that something is happening. There’s a lot of information to collect and store. How can the NSA possibly catalogue all of this data? I suspect the NSA doesn't have large files on each and every one of us. I'm sure on particularly well-known targets they have information, but I presume you and I aren’t on watch lists. Brewster Kahle produced a model that said if someone took all the domestic phone calls made in one year and put them into cloud storage, it would cost roughly $27 million a year to store. That's chump change for agencies like the NSA, the Department of Defense and others. Storage is getting so cheap these days that we can store mountains of data at relatively low cost. When you think about the number of phone calls one can make in a year, there's an upper bound to that. Technology doesn't let me speak any faster—we're not making a much higher magnitude of calls than we were a few years ago, but the storage capacity has gone up many times. Our storage is outpacing our ability to produce information. We are sending more emails than we were years ago, but at a certain point, I can only bang out emails so fast. But the ability to store those emails? That continues to increase exponentially. Do you see a future where entities store all the information we produce? It's not the future. It's the present, and it’s called Google, it's called Yahoo, it's called Facebook. Facebook already has every IM you've ever sent [through Facebook]. Google has saved all those emails you've been sending [through Gmail]. They have it, they've indexed it, and they’ve generated models on you. This isn't the future; this is the last few years. Is that data collection for advertising purposes? Definitely. In advertising, retailers build certain models. If every week I'm buying beer and chips, and then suddenly they see me buying a pregnancy test, and then they see me buying diapers. They can say Oh, okay. Single life is over. We know what's going on, we're going to send this guy info about baby products. Everyone is doing predictive modeling. On that note, do you see a privacy issue here? There's a huge privacy issue. There's this great video from the ACLU about ordering a pizza in the future that sums it up. There aren't really any data privacy laws in place. In terms of what a website or retailer can track about you, I'm not aware of any laws on that subject. We as individuals generally value that information at zero. In studies tresearchers have asked people: For this particular website or service, we'll give you two choices: you can either pay for it, or you get it free, but it comes with ads. Everyone took it for free with ads. What they don't realize, or what they know and don't care about, is that those ads come with tracking cookies. They're collecting these massive data sets on us, and we as Americans just don't mind. Both culturally and legally, we don't seem to care. I think that's very unfortunate. Is there anything unquestionably positive we can do with data collection beyond counterterrorism and advertising? Big data is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or bad. The Internet can be used to disseminate information on an unimaginable scale, and it can be used for child porn. So it’s really in the hands of the people who use it. We can build models like we never have before. In crime, New York is famous for the Compstat system, where police look at what crimes occurred and when and where it happened. They allocate the police force based on that. A more efficient police force is wonderful for society. Again, these models can be used for good or bad. Those police could be used to stop the criminals, or in the extreme police state, those officers could be used to crack down on dissenters. In the end, companies are collecting an obscene amount of data on us, and I think that’s just as much a threat to individuals as government data collection might be."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":37,"title":"Canadian casino in cyber attack","class":0,"body":"River Cree Resort suffers theft of customer and employee data Hackers have stolen customer and employee information from one of the biggest casinos in Canada in the latest in several cyber attacks in recent weeks. Sample the FT’s top stories for a week The River Cree Resort and Casino said on Friday it was the victim of a cyber attack on Monday and immediately alerted law enforcement and cyber security experts. We wanted to alert anyone potentially affected quickly and directly, said Robert Morton, River Cree chief executive. We are in the process of contracting those patrons and employees whose information may have been compromised and will provide them with recommended steps they can now take to protect themselves. River Cree, in Alberta, has more than 1,000 slot machines, 38 gaming tables, two ice rinks and an adjoining 249-bed hotel. Few details of the computer hacking have been released to the public, although casino management said in a statement that no information from the casino floor was stolen. The hacking incident follows the disclosure of the theft of tens of millions of dollars from Bangladesh’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York this week and a separate admission by a Californian hospital that it paid a ransom of $17,000 to hackers to regain control of its computer systems after a hack. Kevin Mandia, president of FireEye, a US-based cyber security company that is investigating the Bangladesh and Canadian casino hack, said these are examples of the growing sophistication of cyber criminals. Cyber extortion in the 1990s was on a different level of scale and scope, typically demands were for $5-15,000 to make a problem go away; now its millions, he said. He said hackers have begun to shift their focus away from stealing credit card numbers. Now we have an anonymous currency, bitcoin, and I’ve always learned that anonymity does wonders for the criminal element far more than it helps well intentioned people, he said. Special Report Cyber Security Sentiment towards cyber defence industry sours as backers look harder at what companies offer FireEye has dispatched investigators to Bangladesh and the Canadian casino to collect and analyse data from the computer systems and try to determine how the breaches took place. They look at the malware used by the hackers to breach a system, the source and destination IP addresses, the internet domains used and who registered them to try and determine who is behind the attack. Mr Mandia said it was unusual for cyber criminals to enlist insiders when breaking into banks’ systems as they generally liked to remain out of reach in safe harbour locations. It’s one more example of why we need to have a little more international co-operation. If we have world were you can steal millions of dollars and there are no risks or repercussions at all, we are not doing something right, he said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":38,"title":"NSA's Bulk Collection Of Americans' Phone Data Is Illegal, Appeals Court Rules","class":0,"body":"The National Security Agency's practice of collecting data about Americans' telephone calls in bulk goes beyond what Congress intended when it wrote Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act, a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday. The three-judge panel was asked to consider whether the program violated the Constitution. Instead, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel punted on the constitutional claim, deciding the program was simply not authorized by federal law. One of the big reasons it is hard to discern congressional intent in this case, the court wrote, is that the bulk collection program has been shrouded in secrecy. So it cannot reasonably be said that Congress OK'd a program of which many members of Congress — and all members of the public — were not aware. The court concludes that it has no qualms about taking this step because if Congress wants to authorize such a far-reaching and unprecedented program, it has every opportunity to do so, and to do so unambiguously. According to The New York Times, this is the first time a higher-level court in the regular judicial system has reviewed the program, which since 2006 has repeatedly been approved in secret by a national security court. The NSA's collection of phone metadata came back into the spotlight after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents that shed light on the scope of the program. One of the first leaked documents was a secret court ruling that ordered Verizon to hand over the telephone metadata of all its customers. Metadata does not mean the content of calls. Instead it means things like time, phone numbers and duration of calls. The panel has vacated a lower court's decision to dismiss the case and has sent it back for further review. The panel also refused to order a preliminary end to the program, saying Congress is currently debating the NSA's bulk collection program. We deem it prudent to pause to allow an opportunity for debate in Congress that may (or may not) profoundly alter the legal landscape, the panel wrote.Update at 11:47 a.m. ET. Obama Believes Bulk Collection Should End: Without specifically commenting on the court's ruling, Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said President Obama has already expressed a preference for ending the bulk collection of metadata as it exists today. As we reported back in January 2014, Obama said he would prefer that the government not keep a massive database of Americans' telephone data. Instead, the data could live elsewhere and the U.S. government could query the information based on each investigation. We continue to work closely with members of Congress from both parties to do just that and we have been encouraged by good progress on bipartisan, bicameral legislation that would implement these important reforms, Price said in a statement.Update at 11:44 a.m. ET. 'Resounding Victory For The Rule Of Law': This decision is a resounding victory for the rule of law, ACLU Staff Attorney Alex Abdo, who argued the case before the three-judge panel last September, said in a statement. For years, the government secretly spied on millions of innocent Americans based on a shockingly broad interpretation of its authority. The court rightly rejected the government's theory that it may stockpile information on all of us in case that information proves useful in the future. Mass surveillance does not make us any safer, and it is fundamentally incompatible with the privacy necessary in a free society. The ACLU also urged Congress to up its reform game to align itself with the concerns raised by the 2nd Circuit. Update at 10:21 a.m. ET. 'Preceded By Substantial Debate': The panel argued that when Congress passed the Patriot Act, it could not have understood the sweeping nature of the program. The panel explains: Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans. Perhaps such a contraction is required by national security needs in the face of the dangers of contemporary domestic and international terrorism. But we would expect such a momentous decision to be preceded by substantial debate, and expressed in unmistakable language. There is no evidence of such a debate in the legislative history of § 215, and the language of the statute, on its face, is not naturally read as permitting investigative agencies, on the approval of the FISC [the secret national security court], to do any more than obtain the sorts of information routinely acquired in the course of criminal investigations of 'money laundering [and] drug dealing.'  Update at 9:57 a.m. ET. Echoes Some Members Of Congress:NPR's David Welna, who covers national security for the network, tells us the ruling echoes what some members of Congress have been saying. David reports: This ruling dovetails with what one of the lead authors of the Patriot Act — former House Judiciary Committee chairman James Sensenbrenner — said last week about Section 215: 'I can say in no uncertain terms that Congress did not intend to allow the bulk collection of Americans' records. The government's overbroad collection is based on a blatant misreading of the law.' The House Judiciary Committee last week approved a revision of Section 215 that bars bulk data collection under that provision. Senate Majority Leader McConnell has a bill pending that would extend Section 215 without changes until 2020."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":39,"title":"Cyber hack got access to over 700,000 IRS accounts","class":0,"body":"A 2015 cyber hack of the IRS potentially gained access to personal data from more than 700,000 taxpayer accounts, more than double the total previously estimated, the tax agency said Friday. The information potentially stolen includes Social Security numbers, birth dates and other data that cyber thieves could use to impersonate a real taxpayer, file a false federal tax return and collect a refund. The unidentified electronic attackers got in, giving the IRS an embarrassing black eye, by taking taxpayer information they acquired elsewhere and using it to correctly answer personal identity-verification questions in the Get Transcript application on the agency's website. The function, disabled after the IRS discovered the breach last May, enabled legitimate taxpayers to view their tax account transactions or line-by-line tax return information for a specific tax year. The IRS initially said approximately 100,000 taxpayer accounts had been compromised, then raised the total to as many as 334,000 in August. Friday's estimate added an additional 390,000 accounts, boosting the estimated total to more than 700,000. The cyber thieves unsuccessfully tried to gain access to more than 500,000 other taxpayer accounts, the IRS said. That total is also far higher than previously estimated. The heightened threat to U.S. taxpayers was documented in a nine-month review conducted by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which oversees the IRS. The cyber thieves gained access to taxpayer accounts between January 2014, the launch for the Get Transcript function, and May 2015, the IRS said. TIGTA officials are expected to release an audit report on the findings later this year. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said his agency plans to mail notifications and assistance offers to taxpayers whose accounts showed signs of suspicious access. The offers include a free Equifax identity theft protection product for one year, along with IRS personal identification numbers. Additionally, the IRS is placing extra scrutiny on taxpayers' Social Security numbers, and sharing information about the attack with state tax officials. The IRS is committed to protecting taxpayers on multiple fronts against tax-related identity theft, and these mailings are part of that effort, said Koskinen. The cyber breach represents one of many computer problems the IRS has confronted in recent years. An electronic outage caused by sequential failure of a voltage regulator and backup regulator on a computer that handles tax returns for millions of Americans halted processing for approximately 30 hours early this month before service was restored. The tax agency also disclosed this month that it had detected unauthorized efforts to gain access to e-file personal identification numbers for more than 450,000 Social Security numbers. Approximately 101,000 of those efforts, which occurred in January, succeeded in accessing an e-file ID number, the IRS said. Separately, at least seven federal audits and other reports from 2007 to 2014 outlined computer dangers that ranged from failures in IRS database controls to hiring an ex-convict without a background check and failing to screen  other workers who had access to personal data for millions of taxpayers. Computer security has been problematic for the IRS since 1997, the IRS inspector general warned in an an October 2014 report . Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Operations, accused the IRS of incompetency over the two hacking incidents during a hearing earlier this month. The IRS doesn't have its house in order at any level, said Chaffetz, who has urged the House to impeach Koskinen."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":40,"title":"Government alleges former NSA contractor stole ‘astonishing quantity’ of classified data over 20 years","class":0,"body":"Federal prosecutors in Baltimore on Thursday said they will charge a former National Security Agency contractor with violating the Espionage Act, alleging that he made off with an astonishing quantity of classified digital and other data over 20 years in what is thought to be the largest theft of classified government material ever. In a 12-page memo, U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein and two other prosecutors laid out a much more far-reaching case against Harold T. Martin III than was previously outlined. They say he took at least 50 terabytes of data and six full banker’s boxes worth of documents, with many lying open in his home office or kept on his car’s back seat and in the trunk. Other material was stored in a shed on his property.  One terabyte is the equivalent of 500 hours’ worth of movies. Martin, who will appear at a detention hearing in U.S. District Court in Baltimore on Friday, also took personal information about government employees as well as dozens of computers, thumb drives and other digital storage devices, the government memo said. The government has not alleged that Martin passed any material to a foreign government, but contends that if he is released on bail he could do so. Though he lacks a valid U.S. passport, the government said Martin could still flee to a foreign government that might wish to help him. Prosecutors said he has communicated with unnamed people in Russian and in June downloaded information on Russian and other languages. The prosecutors also said Martin had an arsenal of weapons in his home and car, including an assault-rifle-style tactical weapon and a pistol-grip shotgun with a flash suppressor. In a complaint unsealed earlier this month, the government charged him with felony theft of government property and the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials, a misdemeanor. The prosecutors said that when an indictment is filed, they expect charges to include violations of the Espionage Act, offenses that carry a prison term of up to 10 years for each count. Prosecutors will argue Friday that Martin, 51, of Glen Burnie, Md., presents a high risk of flight, a risk to the nation and to the physical safety of others, and that he should not be released from jail. The case against the defendant thus far is overwhelming, and the investigation is ongoing, said Rosenstein, Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Myers and trial attorney David Aaron. The defendant knows, and, if no longer detained, may have access to a substantial amount of highly classified information, which he has flagrantly mishandled and could easily disseminate to others. Continued detention without bail is necessary, prosecutors said, because of the grave and severe danger that pretrial release of the defendant would pose to the national security of the United States. Martin’s attorneys argued in a memo filed Thursday that their client is not a flight risk and should be released under court-approved conditions pending trial. The government concocts fantastical scenarios in which Mr. Martin — who, by the government’s own admission, does not possess a valid passport — would attempt to flee the country, wrote public defenders James Wyda and Deborah L. Boardman. Martin’s wife and home are in Maryland, they said. He has served in the U.S. Navy. There is no evidence he intended to betray his country, they said. The government simply does not meet its burden of showing that no conditions of release would reasonably assure Mr. Martin’s future appearance in court. The government also alleged that Martin took a top-secret document detailing specific operational plans against a known enemy of the United States. Prosecutors did not name the enemy. The document, prosecutors said, contained a warning, in capital letters, that said: This conop [concept of operations] contains information concerning extremely sensitive U.S. planning and operations that will be discussed and disseminated only on an absolute need to know basis. Martin was not involved in the operation, the government said, and had no need to have the document or know its specifics. Another document found in his car contained handwritten notes describing NSA’s classified computer systems and detailed descriptions of classified technical operations, the prosecutors said. In an interview before his arrest, Martin denied having taken classified material and only admitted to it when confronted with specific documents, prosecutors said. He had access to classified data beginning in 1996, when he was with the Navy Reserve, and that access continued through his employment with seven private government contractors. The government alleged that Martin was able to defeat myriad, expensive controls placed on classified information. They said the devices seized show he made extensive use of sophisticated encryption. He also used a sophisticated software tool that runs without being installed on a computer and provides anonymous Internet access, leaving no digital footprint on the machine, they said. In August, a cache of highly sensitive NSA hacking tools mysteriously appeared online. Although investigators have not found conclusive evidence that he was responsible for that, he is the prime suspect, said U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. That is the event that set off the search that turned up Martin, the officials said. In July, according to the prosecutors’ memo, he watched a video about how law enforcement authorities catch computer users who wish to remain anonymous on the Internet. He has a demonstrated ability to conceal his online communications and his access to the Internet, the prosecutors said. To support their argument that Martin poses a danger to the community, they noted that in late July, he went to Connecticut to buy a Detective Special police-package Chevrolet Caprice. While searching his house, the FBI also recovered 10 firearms, only two of which were registered, the government said. Prosecutors said a loaded handgun was found in a case on the floorboard of the Caprice, in violation of Maryland law. Martin’s wife, Deborah Vinson, was very upset to learn about his arsenal, prosecutors said, and asked the FBI to take custody of the firearms because she was afraid that he would kill himself if he thought it was all over. If Martin had taken the classified material for his own edification, as he has claimed, there would be no reason to keep some of it in his car, and arm himself as though he were trafficking in dangerous contraband, prosecutors said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":41,"title":"Feds seized 50TB of data from NSA contractor suspected of theft","class":0,"body":"It's still not clear if Harold Martin was connected to the Shadow Brokers NSA dump.In a new Thursday court filing, federal prosecutors expanded their accusations against a former National Security Agency contractor. Federal investigators seized at least 50 terabytes of data from Harold Thomas Martin III, at least some of which was national defense information. If all of this data was indeed classified, it would be the largest such heist from the NSA, far larger than what former contractor Edward Snowden took. Prosecutors also said that Martin should remain locked up and noted that he will soon becharged with violations of the Espionage Act. That law, which dates back nearly a century, is the same law that was used to charge Chelsea Manning and Snowden, among others. If convicted, violators can face the death penalty. United States Attorney Rod Rosenstein and two other prosecutors laid out new details in the case against Martin, whose arrest only became public earlier this month. Martin had been a contractor with Booz Allen Hamilton and possessed a top-secret clearance. The new filing states that Martin also took six full bankers’ boxes worth of paper documents, many which were marked Secret or Top Secret. The documents date from between 1996 through 2016. The weight of the evidence against the Defendant is overwhelming, court document plainly state. For example, the search of the Defendant’s car revealed a printed email chain marked as Top Secret and containing highly sensitive information. The document appears to have been printed by the Defendant from an official government account. On the back of the document are handwritten notes describing the NSA’s classified computer infrastructure and detailed descriptions of classified technical operations. The handwritten notes also include descriptions of the most basic concepts associated with classified operations, as if the notes were intended for an audience outside of the Intelligence Community unfamiliar with the details of its operations. The government also presents new biographical information about Martin, noting that he has obtained advanced educational degrees and has taken extensive government training courses on computer security, including in the areas of encryption and secure communications. Martin allegedly used a sophisticated software tool which runs without being installed on a computer and provides anonymous Internet access, leaving no digital footprint on the Machine, and he tried to run operating systems on his machines that would not leave any forensic evidence of his computer activities. That could suggest Martin was using TAILS or another USB-bootable operating system in conjunction with Tor or a VPN. While the new filing does not specifically mention it, the New York Times reported Wednesday that Martin may have been involved in the Shadow Brokers dump of NSA exploits. As the Times reported: But so far, the investigators have been frustrated in their attempt to prove that Mr. Martin deliberately leaked or sold the hacking tools to the Shadow Brokers or, alternatively, that someone hacked into his computer or otherwise took them without his knowledge. While they have found some forensic clues that he might be the source, the evidence is not conclusive, according to a dozen officials who have been involved in or have been briefed on the investigation. The former NSA contractor is accused of owning 10 guns, only two of which were registered, including an AR-style tactical rifle. Martin’s wife, Deborah Shaw, was very upset to learn about the Defendant’s arsenal. According to the new court filing, Shaw asked all the firearms to be removed from her home, and they were taken away by the FBI. Among the documents seized, investigators found a letter sent in 2007 to Martin’s colleagues, in which he criticizes the government’s information security practices and refers to those same co-workers as clowns. Martin is set to appear before US Magistrate Judge Beth P. Gesner for a detention hearing on Friday at 2:15pm ET in Baltimore."}

It's not known exactly what Martin allegedly stole, but a report from The New York Times on Wednesday suggests that the recently leaked hacking tools used by the agency to conduct surveillance were among the stolen cache of files. Prosecutors will on Friday charge Martin with violating the Espionage Act. If convicted, he could face 10 years in prison on each count. The charges, news of which was first reported by The Washington Post, outline a far deeper case than first thought, compared to the felony theft and a lesser misdemeanor charge of removal and retention of classified information revealed in an unsealed indictment last month. According to the Post citing a memo written by US Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the contractor presents a high risk of flight, a risk to the nation, and to the physical safety of others.

Retired US Navy officer Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, has been dubbed ‘the second Snowden’ by the press. He worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, the same firm that employed the famous whistleblower who revealed global surveillance programs run by the US.  Snowden on US pardon: Congress, president, courts changed policies, but no individuals hurt Martin was arrested late August, but his case was only made public earlier this month. He allegedly hoarded at least 50,000 gigabytes (or 50 terabytes) of classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA), reportedly including the US government’s hacking tools. For reference, one gigabyte is enough to store some 10,000 pages of documents containing both images and text, so Martin allegedly stole enough data to fill 10,000 DVDs. Federal prosecutors called Martin’s alleged data theft breathtaking in its scale and longevity, as his actions appear to predate those of Edward Snowden. The defendant was in possession of an astonishing quantity of marked classified documents which he was not entitled to possess, including many marked [secret], prosecutors said on Thursday, as cited by theAP. Originally charged with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials, Martin now also faces charges under the Espionage Act, which would expose him to harsher penalties if he is convicted. A contractor with the federal government since 1996, Martin worked in the Tailored Access Operations unit, the department responsible for hacking the networks of foreign governments. Through this job, he had access to classified information for the past two decades.  According to prosecutors, agents who searched Martin's home and car found dozens of computers and electronic devices, as well as classified government material dating from 1996 to 2016. The information includes an email chain marked ‘Top Secret’ apparently printed from an official government account. Prosecutors say that on the back of the document they found handwritten notes describing the NSA's classified computer infrastructure, written in a way that suggests they were intended for an audience outside of the Intelligence Community, AP reports. Adding to the prosecutors’ belief that Martin was aiming to make the data public is the allegation he was trying to use technology designed to encrypt communication and allow online anonymity. At the time of his arrest he was enrolled in a doctoral program on information security management, and as his computers showed, he appeared to be trying to connect to the internet anonymously using a specialized operating system. The espionage charge, however, was proposed after prosecutors discovered Martin had online communication in languages other than English, including in Russian, which made them believe he could be cooperating with a foreign government. Best of the worst: Here are the most shocking WikiLeaks Podesta emails so far Given the nature of his offenses and knowledge of national secrets, he presents tremendous value to any foreign power that may wish to shelter him within or outside of the United States, prosecutors said, describing the total amount of evidence against Martin as overwhelming. The evidence is overwhelming that the defendant abused [America's] trust and chose to repeatedly violate his agreements, his oaths and the law, and to retain extremely sensitive government information to use however he wished, prosecutors stated. Neither investigators nor prosecutors, however, revealed what prompted the initial search of Martin’s property that led to his arrest. Martin has so far admitted to storing classified materials, but has not replied to accusations of intending to pass them on. Martin’s defense attorneys claim that their client took the information from the office solely to work on it further and improve his job-related skills, maintaining that there is no clear evidence he intended to betray his country and leak the data.  ccording to agents that searched Martin’s home, many of the documents were lying openly in his home study or were scattered in the backseat and trunk of his vehicle.Booz Allen Hamilton fired Martin soon after his arrest and offered the authorities full cooperation on the investigation. If convicted, Martin faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for unauthorized removal of classified data, and 10 years in prison for theft of government property. The espionage charge, however, is regarded as a serious crime under US federal law and can result in stronger punishments, including life in prison."}

We're confident these are not amateurs [but are] actually organized crime syndicates that not only we but everyone in the financial industry are dealing with, Koskinen said. The IRS, in a statement, said the criminals gained sufficient information from an outside source before trying to access the IRS site, which allowed them to clear a multi-step authentication process, including several personal verification questions that typically are only known by the taxpayer. The agency said the Treasury inspector general for tax administration and the IRS's Criminal Investigation unit are reviewing the breach; the Get Transcript application has been shut down temporarily.

These are the names of surveillance devices that the Obama administration uses to spy on American citizens through their cellphones. US Approves $1.2Bln Sale of Long-Range Surveillance Drones to Japan A secret internal US government catalogue detailing dozens of surveillance devices that law enforcement agencies use to spy on Americans' cellphones was leaked to The Intercept, the investigative news site reported Thursday. The Intercept obtained the catalogue from a source within the intelligence community concerned about the militarization of domestic law enforcement, the report stated. The report, received from an anonymous source within the intelligence community, covers spy techniques used by local and federal US law enforcement. The devices have several modes of use. Some are portable, others are designed to be used at static locations. The CIA, the NSA, and US Special Forces were indicated to be developers and vendors of the devices, according to the document. While developed primarily for military and intelligence targets, the devices are known to be widely used by local police who justify their use in the wake of a perceived local terrorist threat. One device is capable of spying on 10,000 mobile phone users simultaneously, to identify their location, wiretap, and catch SMS-messages. © FLICKR/ THOMAS HEYLEN Privacy Activists Warn Cyber Spying Bill May Pass Congress in Secret US law enforcement agencies have been widely criticized by privacy advocates and civil liberties groups for employing invasive surveillance technologies to spy on ordinary US citizens. Civil liberties activists slammed the use of devices, pointing out that their use by local police contravenes the constitutional rights of US citizens and is different from a military context, as the country is not at war. Cellphone surveillance is a contentious issue. It's no secret that the intelligence community has traditionally spied for the military and government. Now surveillance has gone beyond traditional use. It can take decades for the public to learn what our police departments are doing, by which point constitutional violations may be widespread, Nathan Wessler, a staff attorney with the Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project of the American Civil Liberties Union said. By showing what new surveillance capabilities are coming down the pike, these documents will help lawmakers, judges, and the public know what to look out for as police departments seek ever-more powerful electronic surveillance tools. The catalogue includes details on the Stingray cellphone surveillance technology and dozens of more obscure devices that can be mounted on vehicles, drones and piloted aircraft, which are designed to track the physical location of a suspected terrorist. Whistleblower provides @the_intercept w/ doc exposing cellphone spy tech used by US agencies December 17, 2015 Some 60 law enforcement agencies in the US are believed to possess a Stingray or some other type of cellphone-site simulator. Many pundits claim that the number is far below the real total. How much of their budget local law enforcement spends on Stingray, or similar technologies, is not known, as many systems are purchased with proceeds from the sale of assets seized under federal civil forfeiture law, in drug busts or other operations. Police in Illinois, Michigan, and Maryland have reportedly used asset forfeiture funds to pay for Stingray-like equipment. The full extent of the secrecy surrounding cell-site simulators is completely unjustified and unlawful, Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation said. No police officer or detective should be allowed to withhold information from a court or criminal defendant about how the officer conducted an investigation. FBI, NSA, and the US military have not commented on the report despite requests by The Intercept. In November, the US Supreme Court rejected a request to reconsider a lower court decision allowing the federal government to access cellphone location data without warrant."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":46,"title":" Big Brother is tapping your mobile phone: Obama admits NSA routinely spying on all Verizon phone customers in the USA","class":0,"body":"NaturalNews) The USA is reeling today from the explosive discovery that the Obama administration has been spying on all Verizon phone customers by surveilling their phone usage on a daily basis for the last several years. This is a wholesale, routine spy surveillance program that has Big Brother written all over it. It was first exposed by The Guardian which has published the secret court order requiring Verizon to hand over all phone call data on an ongoing, daily basis. As the Guardian writes:  Under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk -- regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.  As background, please note that websites like Natural News and www.InfoWars.com have been warning people for years that the NSA was secretly listening to their phone calls and surveilling their bank accounts, emails and web surfing behavior. Giggling deniers in the liberal media have routinely referred to all this as a conspiracy theory while deriding those who warned about all this as tin foil hat wearing people or even promoters of hate speech. As it turns out, we were once again right all along: the government really is spying on all your phone calls, emails and other records. The NSA routinely records everything you do even though such actions are blatantly illegal under federal law. Every time the NSA taps your mobile phone (which happens every day, we now know), they are committing a felony crime. But no one is stopping them. And why? Because the government itself has become a lawless criminal operation that answers to no one. Obama admits it's all true Today Obama himself admitted the wholesale surveillance of Verizon phone users is, indeed, taking place. Yes, the NSA is vacuuming up all phone records on an ongoing, daily basis, completely outside of law. But it's a good thing, Obama insists. So what was Obama's justification for all this? The secret NSA surveillance is a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats, he now says, almost as if the ghost of George W were speaking through Obama's lips. From a civil liberties perspective, the program could hardly be any more alarming, said It's a program in which some untold number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance of government agents, said Jameel Jaffer, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. It is beyond Orwellian, and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies. Exactly what data is being surveilled by the NSA? According to the secret surveillance order that has now been exposed, Verizon is handing over all the following information to the NSA for every phone call being made from a Verizon device: • The phone number of both people on the call• The geographic location of the Verizon phone user (whoa!) • Call duration • Unique identifiers (i.e. phone ID, allowing that phone to be tracked) According to the Guardian, this information can then be used by the NSA to reveal:  Your name • Your home address • Your social security number • Your driver's license number • Your credit history • Your place of employment • Your criminal history  Yes, just from surveilling your phone, the NSA can acquire all this information about you. And this is just fine with Obama, who actually defends the program even though it is wildly illegal to conduct such surveillance domestically, against the American people. Oh, and by the way, the government's surveillance order specifically forbids Verizon from disclosing the existence of the secret order to anyone else. So while the government is secretly surveilling all Verizon phone users, the company itself would face criminal charges if it warned its own users about the surveillance. How's that for freedom in a free society?   It's not just Verizon, folks Don't ditch your Verizon phone out of fear of being tracked, however. The fact is the NSA has similar surveillance orders in place with all mobile phone companies. Every American who uses a mobile phone is being tracked on a daily basis by their own government. It's being done routinely, and the NSA is building a massive data center in Utah in order to be able to analyze, in real time, the actual voice content of all phone calls. Those phone calls are already being recorded and archived, by the way. That's been admitted by the FBI. But in the near future, the government will be able to analyze every phone call happening in real time, then flag suspicious conversations for possible action against the offending phone users. This is your America, folks: A runaway criminal police state where the routine government spying on your private conversations is openly admitted and even justified by the President.Oh, but giggling control freaks like Rachel Maddow have always insisted this was nothing but loony conspiracy theory talk. You can trust your government, she says. Because government would never do anything bad... like tapping all your phone calls. That's hate speech to even suggest such a thing!  Wake up, people! The U.S. government is a criminal operation. Just in the last few months, we've learned that the Department of Justice secretly taps the phones of reporters and journalists. The IRS secretly intimidates and terrorizes selected groups based on their political speech. And now we learn the NSA has been routinely spying on us all through a super-secret surveillance program that means none of our electronic communications are private from the government. At what point do you realize just how onerous, dangerous and out of control this has all become? As Mark Rumold, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a Guardian story: This is confirmation of what we've long feared, that the NSA has been tracking the calling patterns of the entire country. We hope more than anything else that the government will allow a judge to decide whether this is constitutional, and we can finally put an end to this practice. Good luck with that. The abuses of government are already so far out of control that it's questionable whether we can reign in this criminal government with anything less than a full-fledged citizens revolt."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":47,"title":"Germany orders Facebook to stop collecting data on WhatsApp users","class":0,"body":"Facebook has been ordered to stop collecting and storing data on WhatsApp users in Germany, marking the first regulatory challenge to a controversial data-sharing scheme that the social media company announced in August. In a statement published Tuesday, Germany's privacy watchdog said that sharing WhatsApp user data with Facebook, the messaging app's parent company, constitutes an infringement of national data protection law. The regulatory body also ordered Facebook to delete all data that has already been transferred from WhatsApp. Facebook's data-sharing scheme has been closely monitored by privacy groups across Europe. When  acebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014, the app's co-founder, Jan Koum, assured users that their privacy would not be compromised. Under the policy announced in August, however, WhatsApp will share some user data — including phone numbers — with Facebook, and plans to allow businesses to contact users directly through its app. WhatsApp has said that the arrangement will allow Facebook to deliver more targeted advertising and friend suggestions, and that analytics data will help combat spam and fraud. But privacy advocates have criticized the companies for not being transparent about the change. In a blog post published after the announcement, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) described the move as a clear threat to users’ control of how their WhatsApp data is shared and used. Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg data protection commissioner, echoed those concerns in a statement on Tuesday, saying that Facebook has not obtained effective approval of the policy change from WhatsApp users. Caspar also expressed concern that Facebook may eventually seek to collect data on a broader range of users, including those listed in WhatsApp contacts lists who are not connected to Facebook. This administrative order protects the data of about 35 million WhatsApp users in Germany, Caspar said. It has to be their decision, whether they want to connect their account with Facebook. Therefore, Facebook has to ask for their permission in advance. This has not happened. Other privacy regulators have raised concerns over the data-sharing scheme. CNIL, France's data protection authority and the chair of a group of privacy regulators across Europe, said in August that privacy watchdogs will be monitoring the change to WhatsApp's policy with great vigilance. The Information Commission's Office (ICO), Britain's data privacy regulator, also said it would monitor how data is shared across the two platforms, though it does not have the authority to block the scheme altogether. In an email statement, a Facebook spokesperson said that the company will appeal the order from Germany's privacy watchdog. Facebook complies with EU data protection law, the spokesperson said. We will appeal this order and we will work with the Hamburg DPA in an effort to address their questions and resolve any concerns."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":48,"title":"UK spy agencies illegally collected data for years, court rules","class":0,"body":"The UK's secret intelligence agencies breached European human rights legislation by secretly collecting communications and personal data in bulk.The U.K.'s spy agencies breached the European Convention on Human Rights for years by secretly collecting almost everything about British citizens' communications except their content, a U.K. court has ruled. However, now that the U.K. government has admitted what it is doing, the collection is legal, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled Monday. It has yet to rule on the issue of proportionality, or whether the agencies' actions were reasonable given the threat they sought to counter. Responding to a June 2015 complaint by campaign group Privacy International, the tribunal said the secret intelligence agencies had breached the ECHR for years because of the way they gathered bulk communications data (BCD) and bulk personal data (BPD). The bulk communications data at issue included who contacted whom, when, where and with what equipment, who paid for the call, and how much they paid. Just about the only information not included is the content of communications, the tribunal said in its ruling. Legally collecting that content would have required an interception warrant. In principle, the government may allow the intelligence agencies to collect communications data from network operators under a 1984 law, the tribunal ruled. However, whether that collection was necessary and proportional is another matter: When the 1984 law was drafted, the tribunal noted, there were no mobile phones and no public internet. Subscriber information was for the most part published in printed directories, so all that network operators could have offered the Security Service and the then officially non-existent Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) was subscriber information for unlisted numbers, and call records, the tribunal noted. The agencies also gathered bulk personal data, including passport  tabases, telephonedirectories, and banking records -- even though, the spy agencies acknowledged in a court filing, the majority of the people affected are unlikely to be of intelligence interest. Rules for collection of bulk personal data are not defined in legislation, the tribunal noted. The bulk data gathering remained secret until March 2015, while the collection of bulk communication data was only admitted by the U.K. government in November 2015. While it remained a secret, the collection of both types of data was in breach of the ECHR. After the government admitted what it was doing, and set out oversight rules and a code of practice for the data collection, it became foreseeable, and so legal, as the citizens being spied on could foresee the consequences of their actions, the tribunal ruled. Following the ruling, Privacy International legal officer Millie Graham Wood said the use of bulk communications data poses huge risks. It is unacceptable that it is only through litigation by a charity that we have learned the extent of these powers and how they are used, she said. She called for public confirmation that unlawfully obtained personal data will be destroyed."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":49,"title":"Court Rules NSA Bulk Data Collection Was Never Authorized By Congress","class":0,"body":"AS AMERICANS WAIT for Congress to decide next month whether to renew the Patriot Act and the vast NSA metadata surveillance program it’s made possible, a panel of three appellate judges has made the decision on its own: The Patriot Act, they’ve now ruled, was never written to authorize the sort of sweeping surveillance the NSA interpreted it to allow. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled on Thursday that the bulk collection of Americans’ phone metadata by the NSA wasn’t in fact authorized by section 215 of the Patriot Act, as the intelligence community has argued since the program was first revealed in the leaks of Edward Snowden two years ago. The ruling doesn’t immediately halt the domestic phone records surveillance program. But if it’s not overturned by a higher court it could signal the program’s end—and it at least forces Congress to choose whether it wishes to explicitly authorize the program when the Patriot Act comes up for renewal on June 1st. We hold that the text of § 215 cannot bear the weight the government asks us to assign to it, and that it does not authorize the telephone metadata program, the rulingreads. We do so comfortably in the full understanding that if Congress chooses to authorize such a far-reaching and unprecedented program, it has every opportunity to do so, and to do so unambiguously. Until such time as it does so, however, we decline to deviate from widely accepted interpretations of well‐established legal standards. The ruling comes as the latest surprise development in a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union against the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that immediately followed Edward Snowden’s revelations of the NSA’s mass domestic surveillance under the 215 section’s purported authorization. The lawsuit had been dismissed by a lower court in 2013, but the three appellate judges overruled decision. Since it was first revealed, the 215 metadata surveillance program has been under attack from privacy advocates, and even the White House has said it’s exploring alternatives to the current system of collecting every American’s phone records. In a statement responding to the ruling, a spokesperson for the National Security Council writes that it’s already looking at a replacement for the program. The President has been clear that he believes we should end the Section 215 bulk telephony metadata program as it currently exists by creating an alternative mechanism to preserve the program’s essential capabilities without the government holding the bulk data, writes the NSC’s assistant press secretary Ned Price. We continue to work closely with members of Congress from both parties to do just that.But the new court ruling will nonetheless have real significance for Congress’s upcoming decision as to whether and how to reform the Patriot Act. A reform bill known as the USA Freedom Act, which would limit the 215 metadata collection, has advanced in the House. But that bill has been opposed by Republicans. Now, says Cato Institute privacy researcher Julian Sanchez, reform is almost inevitable. This changes the calculus. You now have a federal appellate court saying that the statute in its current form does not authorize this program. If the program needs to continue, it may not be allowed under a straight reauthorization, Sanchez says. If your goal is to preserve this program, reform becomes the surest way to preserve some version of it. In addition to questioning the program’s authorization, the ACLU has also argued that the program violated Americans’ fourth amendment rights to protection from warrantless search and seizure. But the judges were careful not to address that constitutional argument. Instead the court narrowed its ruling to state only that the hoovering up of every Americans’ phone metadata is beyond the scope of what the US Congress had in mind when it passed section 215 of the Patriot Act after September 11, 2001. Despite its reluctance to rule the NSA’s metadata program unconstitutional, the ruling seems to recognize the invasive potential of a system that monitors who calls whom, rather than the content of those calls. That telephone metadata do not directly reveal the content of telephone calls, it reads, does not vitiate the privacy concerns arising out of the government’s bulk collection of such data. A call to a single‐purpose telephone number such as a hotline might reveal that an individual is: a victim of domestic violence or rape; a veteran; suffering from an addiction of one type or another; contemplating suicide; or reporting a crime. Metadata can reveal civil, political, or religious affiliations; they can also reveal an individual’s social status, or whether and when he or she is involved in intimate relationships. Even so, the ruling notes that such metadata isn’t owned by the individuals whose privacy is at stake. Instead, it’s held by phone carriers, leaving it open to what’s known as the third-party doctrine, the legal argument that Americans don’t have an expectation of privacy for records held by a third party, and thus they don’t have protection under the fourth amendment. The ruling declines to contradict that argument. Instead, it attacks the notion that Congress ever intended to authorize such a sweeping, mass collection of metadata. As the judges read the Patriot Act, they say it’s intended for targeted investigations in a specific cases, not dragnet surveillance with no limits in time or target. The government effectively argues that there is only one enormous ‘anti‐terrorism’ investigation, and that any records that might ever be of use in developing any aspect of that investigation are relevant to the overall counterterrorism effort, the ruling reads. The records demanded are not those of suspects under investigation, or of people or businesses that have contact with such subjects, or of people or businesses that have contact with others who are in contact with the subjects – they extend to every record that exists, and indeed to records that do not yet exist, as they impose a continuing obligation on the recipient of the subpoena to provide such records on an ongoing basis as they are created. The ruling notes that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the defendant in the case, had argued that Congress had implicitly approved the mass metadata collection when it reauthorized that section of the Patriot Act in 2010 and 2011. But the judges point out that most members of Congress weren’t even aware of the program, and that showing it had truly been authorized would require evidence of explicit discussion, not closed-door hints and whispers. Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans, the judges write. Perhaps such a contraction is required by national security needs in the face of the dangers of contemporary domestic and international terrorism.  But we would expect such a momentous decision to be preceded by substantial debate, and expressed in unmistakable language. Congress will have its chance to make that decision in unmistakable language in less than a month, when the Patriot Act comes up again for renewal. In a statement, Senator Ron Wyden says that it should take this opportunity to end the program altogether. This dragnet surveillance program violates the law and tramples on Americans’ privacy rights without making our country any safer. It is long past time for it to end, writes Wyden, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee who has been a longtime critic of the 215 program. Now that this program is finally being examined in the sunlight, the Executive Branch’s claims about its legality and effectiveness are crumbling. The President should end mass surveillance immediately. If not, Congress needs to finish the job and finally end this dragnet."}

It also allegedly spied on European firms. Among individuals targeted was German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Germany has drastically reduced internet surveillance for the NSA, reports say, after the US agency failed to provide clear justification for each search. Analysis: Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Washington Members of Congress could help reinforce the court's decision next week, American University's Gordon Adams tells me. That's when House members are expected to vote on a bill, the USA Freedom Act, that would end the NSA's collection of bulk data. Some senators, however, want things to remain the same. They've pushed for an extension of a provision, Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act that allows the NSA to collect the data. Section 215 expires in June, and an extension would allow the NSA to carry on with its work. The latest verdict, by the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, came after New York District Judge William Pauley had dismissed a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) which argued that the way the NSA tracked million of calls contravened the US constitution.The 97-page ruling says that a provision of the USA Patriot Act permitting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to collect business records deemed relevant to a counterterrorism investigation cannot be legitimately interpreted to permit the systematic bulk collection of domestic calling records. However, the appeals court stopped short of ruling on the constitutionality of the programme, launched after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US. The Snowden revelations in June 2013 caused an international outcry, despite US administrations insisting the programme has been fully authorised. The measures - repeatedly approved in secret by a national security court since 2006 - are set to expire on 1 June. Leaders of the lower US House of Representatives would prefer to pass a bill to end the government's bulk collection of phone records and replace it with legislation that supporters say protects civil liberties. But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he wants to extend the Patriot Act and retain the bulk collection programme. The White House supports an alternative mechanism to preserve the program's essential capabilities without the government holding the bulk data, said Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council.

{"id":58,"title":"Russia's absence means nuclear summit likely to end in anticlimax for Obama ","class":0,"body":"When Barack Obama welcomes more than 50 world leaders to Washington on Thursday ahead of his fourth and final nuclear security summit, one of the most important chairs will be empty. Russia is thought to possess more nuclear weapons than any other country, including the US. Together the cold war foes share more than 90% of the world’s arsenal. So President Vladimir Putin’s decision to boycott the high-level talks threatens to turn them into an elaborate anticlimax, even as fears of nuclear terrorism are on the up. This is the last of the summits and Putin isn’t even participating, said Professor Peter Kuznick, director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American University in Washington DC. It’s going to lose momentum at a time we need to be increasing momentum. Indeed, one of Obama’s signature foreign policy initiatives is now seen by some as a metaphor for his presidency: laudable for some real and significant achievements but incremental rather than revolutionary, ultimately falling short of ambitious goals, including his own. Nuclear talks appear to be a victim of the tensions between Washington and Moscow in general and Obama and Putin in particular. Earlier this week, for example, the American president memorably recalled how Putin had disagreed with some of the statements about foreign policy he had made in an interview with the Atlantic magazine. I pointed out to him, of course, that unlike you, Vladimir, I don’t get to edit the piece before it’s published. In an opinion column in the Washington Post on Wednesday, Obama argued that the US and Russia should negotiate to further reduce their nuclear stockpiles. Our massive cold war nuclear arsenal is poorly suited to today’s threats, he said. But the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told Reuters that Russia was skipping the summit because of a shortage of mutual cooperation in working out the agenda. Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, described the decision as a missed opportunity for Russia above all, adding: Frankly, all they’re doing is isolating themselves in not participating as they have in the past. But he insisted that the countries have ongoing cooperation and dialogue. But there is still plenty to talk about in Washington. The recent terrorist attacks in Brussels have fuelled concerns that Islamic State could eventually target nuclear plants and develop radioactive dirty bombs. Two of the suicide bombers involved in this month’s attack secretly filmed the daily routine of the head of Belgium’s nuclear research and development programme and considered an attack on a nuclear site in the country, according to Belgian media. There will be a special session during the summit aimed at coordinating efforts to defeat Isis. Experts warn that much of the world’s plutonium and highly enriched uranium remains vulnerable to theft at thousands of sites, including universities and hospitals. But Laura Holgate, the White House National Security Council’s senior director for weapons of mass destruction, pointed to commitments from 30 countries at the 2014 summit to secure their most dangerous material. The international community has made it harder than ever for terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons, and that has made us all more secure, she told reporters. Then there is the North Korea question, following Pyongyang’s detonation of a nuclear device in January and long-range rocket launch a month later. On Thursday Obama will meet the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, followed by separate talks with President Xi Jinping of China. The international community must remain united in the face of North Korea’s continued provocations, he wrote in the Washington Post. North Korea shows off a new type large-calibre multiple rocket launching system at an undisclosed location. Kim Jong-un has claimed a ‘historic’ advance in the country’s nuclear strike capability. North Korea shows off a new rocket launching system. Obama inaugurated the nuclear security summit nearly six years ago after a landmark speech in Prague in 2009 that defined ridding the world of nuclear weapons as a central theme of his presidency. He can certainly claim victories, notably the recent Iran deal and 12 countries having completely eliminated highly enriched uranium or separated plutonium, but commentators say progress has slowed since the last summit in 2014 and now Pakistan, India and Japan are moving towards an increase of their stockpiles. The Nuclear Threat Initiative, an anti-proliferation watchdog, found that over the past two years there has been no improvement in measures including on-site physical protection, security during transport and the ability to recover lost radioactive materials. It said: The nuclear security summits have had a positive effect, but the strategic goal of developing an effective global nuclear security system remains unachieved. Kuznick estimates that on Obama’s watch little more than a ton of nuclear materials has been removed – which still leaves 500 tons of plutonium and 1,300 tons of highly enriched uranium. Of countries that eliminated potential weapons-grade material, he added, some still have nuclear weapons on their soil. If we want to say this is the best thing that came out of Obama’s Prague speech then I think it’s very disappointing, he said. Any even small step in the direction of securing these highly dangerous materials is a step in the right direction and worth taking. But in the broader spectrum of the entire nuclear threat, the steps have been relatively minor. On that day seven years ago in the Czech capital, Obama declared that as the only country to have ever used a nuclear weapon, the US has a moral responsibility to act. To put an end to cold war thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same, he pledged. Yet the Nobel peace prize winner has since laid out plans to modernise the US nuclear arsenal over the next 30 years at a potential cost of nearly $1tn. Kuznick said: I applaud Obama for what he’s trying to do but I think he sends such mixed messages that he undercuts the moral authority of what we’re doing. It’s the height of hypocrisy. Other commentators, however, suggest that Obama’s record compares favourably with other nuclear powers such as Russia, Pakistan and Israel. Jim Walsh, research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s security studies programme, said: He deserves credit among the nuclear weapons states for being a leader trying to move things in the right direction. You can’t say that about anybody else. Assessing the legacy of the Prague speech, Walsh added: Would you like to have cleared up all the nuclear materials? Of course. Was it realistic? Of course not. But we got a new start. Whoever succeeds Obama – and the prospect of Donald Trump gaining access to the nuclear codes fills some with dread – it is very possible that the issue will be less of a diplomatic priority for the next president. Walsh added: I’m a fan of the summit process but over time the momentum has slowed. Among those attending there’s a bittersweet feeling this may be the last one for a while. It’s hard to build an international regime in six to eight years."}

TEHRAN (Sputnik) — Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has invited his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to attend the upcoming Gas Exporting Countries Forum in Iran’s capital Tehran, a Sputnik correspondent reported Thursday.

Why Putin Is So Scared of Debates Once again, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has refused to participate in presidential debates. He skipped out in the 2000 and 2004 presidential races, and two weeks ago Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, announced that Putin was too busy to participate in the 2012 debates, scheduled for next month. Taking time off for debates would impede his ability to carry out his duties, Peskov told Interfax. This explanation is hardly convincing. Throughout his decade in power, Putin has found the time to conduct 10 live call-in shows — each lasting from three to four hours and famous for their soft, staged questions. He also found time to dive for amphorae, meet with bikers and drive a yellow Lada 2,000 kilometers across Siberia — an adventure that took four days to complete. But he apparently has no time to debate his rivals in an important election year polemicized by large street protests and tainted by election fraud. Even more ridiculous was Putin's statement that he could just as well send one of his authorized representatives to debate in his place. United Russia pulled this trick during the debates before the December State Duma elections when the party's leader, Boris Gryzlov, sent other party functionaries on his behalf to debate with leaders of other parties. Putin would have been better sticking to the I'm too busy to bother excuse. His blunder about sending someone else to debate for him became the butt of many jokes. Satirist Viktor Shenderovich quipped on Ekho Moskvy radio that sending a representative to debate in your place is like finding a trusted friend to fill in for you when you are too tired or disinterested to fulfill your marital obligations to your wife. At the same time, however, it is understandable why Putin is more scared of debates this time around. A Levada Center poll in early January showed that only 42 percent of voters would vote for Putin in the first round. By facing even mildly uncomfortable questions from the other four candidates in the debate, all of whom are considered Kremlin friendly, Putin would still run the risk that this rating could drop even further before the election. Despite Putin's superior orator skills and sharp mind, he prefers to play it safe and opt out of the debates. Meanwhile, the Levada poll that gives Putin only 42 percent support is causing serious concerns in the Putin campaign because it wants to avoid a second round at all costs. If this number doesn't increase by March 4, this would mean that electoral manipulations and fraud of about 10 percent of the vote are inevitable to push Putin over 50 percent in the first round. As the country's national leader, Putin will probably want to show at least 53 percent, which is what he got when he was a little-known novice back in 2000. It is a matter of honor and pride. This may be one of the reasons why the Central Elections Commission announced Tuesday that Yabloko founder Grigory Yavlinsky would be disqualified from the presidential race. Although he was expected to receive only about 1 percent of the vote, if he had been approved as a presidential candidate, more than 57,000 Yabloko members would have been allowed special access to monitor polling stations on March 4 — and this would have been dangerous for Putin. After all, Putin promised honest elections this time around, and the last thing he wants is liberal do-gooders from Yabloko raining on his parade by presenting evidence of election fraud. Putin has always been the ultimate Teflon president — but certainly not in the Ronald Reagan sense of the word, for whom the phrase was coined and who participated in numerous presidential debates in 1980 and 1984 election campaigns. Putin's brand of Teflon is clearly made in Russia — with several components imported from Belarus — and the product is marketed extensively on the country's state-run television every day. In an election year especially, Putin would like to apply a couple of new layers of Teflon, and walking away from debates provides this added protection. But tough questions during debates are the sine qua non of any democratic election. A leader's refusal to participate is clear evidence that he is shirking his main public responsibility of being accountable to the people and shows that he is not willing — or able — to defend his record. It also undermines the legitimacy of the election itself. Remember how much attention rock singer Yury Shevchuk attracted in May 2010, when he posed a sharp question to Putin about the sad state of democracy under his rule during a videotaped roundtable discussion that went viral on the Internet. The event was remarkable precisely because it was so rare to see Putin facing a tough question publicly. It shouldn't be this way. In real democracies, of course, leaders face tough questions virtually every day — from journalists, lawmakers and other members of civil society. Opposition parties have been lobbying for years to change the election law to require all candidates to participate directly in debates for Duma and presidential elections. But as long as Putin has been in power, every one of these attempts has been defeated by United Russia. In February, Putin needs to step up to the plate and debate his opponents — even the soft ones. Imagine, for a second, a debate between Putin and opposition leaders who are not loyal to the Kremlin, such as Boris Nemtsov or Vladimir Ryzhkov. Now this would be a real debate. Putin would have to answer for the toughest, most incriminating issues that he has eluded over the past 12 years. Sparks would definitely fly if Nemtsov or Ryzhkov were given the chance to grill Putin about, for example, the botched Beslan and Dubrovka rescue missions that resulted in more than 460 civilian deaths; Baikal Finance Group and the Yukos affair; how Gennady Timchenko, the Rotenberg brothers and dozens of other Putin friends and colleagues got so wealthy so quickly; or even allegations that Putin plagiarized part of his doctoral dissertation, a topic that would be fair game in a presidential debate. Of course, Putin could grill Nemtsov and Ryzhkov about their records in public office, too. In the end, live televised debates would allow voters to make an informed, balanced decision and help them decide which candidate is more qualified to run the country. Debates are much more effective in this regard than staged call-in shows or long-winded, tedious political manifestos. What's more, a majority of Russians want to see live televised presidential debates with all of the candidates participating directly. In a November VTsIOM poll, Putin was the candidate Russians most wanted to see participate in debates. Unfortunately, the 2012 presidential debates will be without Russia's main hero. There is a popular saying in Russian: The truth comes out in an argument. But Putin's latest refusal to participate in presidential debates shows how little he wants the truth to be known. Merkel states conditions under which Putin can participate in Normandy format summit The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is ready to invite the Russian President Vladimir Putin for the Normandy format summit, in case there is a chance to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, announced the spokesman of the German government Steffen Seibert, reports the DW. If there are created prerequisites for a progress, there can take place a direct and personal meeting in Berlin at a high level, said Seibert. According to him, it is necessary to continue contacts and involve Russia in the negotiation process, no matter what is going on in Syria. Seibert and an official representative of the German Foreign Ministry confirmed that the adviser of Merkel and the head of the German Foreign Ministry’s department of political issues are holding talks in Minsk.

{"id":61,"title":" Spotlight: Putin cancels visit to France, throwing ties into uncertainty","class":0,"body":"MOSCOW, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday canceled his visit to France scheduled for Oct. 19 after his French counterpart Francois Hollande insisted on putting Syria on their meeting agenda, throwing Russia-France relations into uncertainty. The president has decided to cancel the visit, as some of the planned events related to the opening of the Russian cultural and spiritual center and an exhibition, unfortunately, have been dropped from the program, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. However, he added that Putin was ready to visit France whenever it is convenient for President Hollande. Putin had been due in Paris on Oct. 19 to inaugurate a spiritual center at a Russian Orthodox church near the Eiffel Tower. The Kremlin announcement was made after Hollande said France and Russia had a major disagreement over Syria, and the Elysee proposed a working meeting only to discuss the Syrian civil war and excluded other topics. Experts believed that the disagreement over Syria between Paris and Moscow has been growing over the last several months, and Putin's cancellation was a culmination of that divergence. On Saturday, Russia vetoed a draft French resolution on Syria at the United Nations (UN) Security Council, and offered its own draft which was also blocked by France, the United States and Britain. Analysts said the Russian veto was another message to the west that any move to support the radical rebels is unacceptable. If it wasn't for the Russian veto, the Western powers would have repeated their hegemony and irresponsible actions, which we have seen in Iraq and Libya, they wanted to create a no-fly zone to support the rebels on ground, and prevent the Syrian government from dislodging the insurgents out of eastern Aleppo, Ahmad al-Ashkar, a journalist and political analyst, told Xinhua. Dozens of militants with the Islamic State were killed Tuesday by a Syrian air strike in the northern province of Aleppo, Syria's national TV reported. Adding that Saudi IS commanders were among those killed in the cave strike. The Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj.-Gen. Igor Konashenkov on Monday listed points of progress as a result of Russia's actions in Syria, including over 1,000 liberated settlements, huge areas freed from the Islamic State, and thousands of tons of humanitarian aid delivered to the needy. It is necessary to have a dialogue with Russia, but it must be firm and frank, otherwise it has no place and it is a sham negotiation, Hollande said in a speech on Tuesday at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, adding that he was ready to meet President Putin at any moment if they can make progress on peace, stop the bombing and declare a truce. Also on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that France remains open for talks with Russia, and the cancellation of Putin's visit to Paris did not mean that the two sides would never hold discussions again. Putin could still meet Hollande at a Berlin meeting on the Ukraine crisis. The leaders of France, Germany and Ukraine in the so-called Normandy format are expected to meet on Oct. 19. Kremlin spokesman Peskov did not confirm Putin's participation in the meeting. He only said that Russia was preparing to participate in such a meeting and will announce its date and time as soon as we are ready."}

{"id":64,"title":"Saudi Arabia And Russia To Meet Ahead Of OPEC Meeting ","class":0,"body":" Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak are said to be heading to Qatar later this week for an unscheduled meeting, according to industry sources quoted by Reuters. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) is meeting in Doha, and though OPEC’s de factor leader Saudi Arabia is not a member of the gas forum, OPEC’s Algeria, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, the UAE, and Venezuela are. According to Reuters sources who had spoken on the condition of anonymity, the Saudi minister was expected to meet other OPEC ministers, and maybe Russia’s Novak, this coming Friday. Some may see this as a good opportunity for the Saudis to take stock of where some OPEC producers and Russia stand on the issue of possible freezes/cuts in production, although most members, including Iraq and Iran, have been pretty vocal about where they stand. The meeting—an unscheduled one —is likely a sign that things are not progressing as planned, and more discussions are required to reach some consensus. The Saudis - OPEC’s biggest producer - who have so often been the ones to cut, said just yesterday that this time around, they will not cut unless there is collective action. According to OPEC sources, Saudi Arabia has said which conditions need to be met so that a deal could go through—and those terms are strict, which is probably telling of the kingdom’s bond sale that went through last month, giving them a bit more of a lifeline than they had before the borrowing. Still, its hardline stance, which was probably never meant to be publicized at this point and could be interpreted as some type of ultimatum, is a bit puzzling given that Saudi Arabia just announced it cut $266 billion in projects—clearly it is feeling the weight of low oil prices. The Saudi terms are: collective action, each producer sharing the burden of the cuts equitably, transparent production figures used for determining the starting point of a cut/freeze, i.e. figures as reported by OPEC, and expectations that Iraq would cut production. So is Iran feeling the crunch to the same degree as Saudi Arabia? Is Iraq? We know Venezuela is, and Angola can’t afford toilet paper for its state-run oil firm employees, but Angola and Venezuela really don’t hold the same sway with production volumes being significantly less than Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq. This week’s meetings on the sidelines of the Doha forum could be another informal round of talks for Falih as the Saudi minister tries to push the kingdom’s agenda and bring the other OPEC members around to the importance of a freeze. Just how important Iran and Iraq see this freeze will likely determine the fate of the OPEC deal, if one is to be had. Although it’s not clear if Falih would meet his Iranian counterpart Bijan Zanganeh - and it’s not even clear yet if Zanganeh would attend in person – the Saudi minister might have plenty of opportunities to discuss the possible deal, not only with fellow OPEC producers, but with Russia as well, who has publicly agreed to a cut, if and only if OPEC members reach a consensus. And while Russia is said to be on board give those conditions, they do not appear to be in the dire straits that many of the OPEC members find themselves in. Al-Falih has a tough road ahead indeed, given that Iran is ramping up output, and Iraq is pleading for an exemption because it is fighting Islamic State. As if this was not enough for a deal-breaker, Iraq and Iran are disputing OPEC figures and are self-reporting higher numbers. On top of that, there’s non-OPEC Russia, which has said that it could join efforts to stabilize markets, yet like OPEC, is showing no signs of stopping, and continues to increase its oil output. With November 30 just two weeks away, reports of diplomatic efforts to clinch some kind of a feasible deal pushed oil prices surging more than 4 percent on Tuesday. As of 1:05 PM (EST), WTI Crude was soaring 4.8 percent to US$45.40, while Brent Crude was up 4.5 percent at US$46.43. According to Tamas Varga, oil analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates, as quoted by Reuters, said: Reports of a diplomatic push by OPEC to strike a deal are supporting the markets. The rally could last a little while but the underlying fundamental picture is still bearish."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":65,"title":"Saudi, Russian energy ministers may meet in Doha ahead of OPEC: sources","class":0,"body":" Saudi Arabian and Russia energy ministers could meet in Qatar this week on the sidelines of a major energy forum, industry sources said on Tuesday as OPEC and non-OPEC members try again to clinch an oil output limiting deal. In September, OPEC agreed at a meeting in Algeria on modest, preliminary, oil output cuts in the first such deal since 2008, with special conditions given to Libya, Nigeria and Iran, whose output has been hit by wars and sanctions. The agreement is expected to be finalised at the next OPEC meeting on Nov. 30 in Vienna but with two weeks to go to the next gathering, disagreements persist among OPEC members and non-OPEC Russia on the exact details of the deal. Oil prices have fallen toward $45 per barrel from over $53 per barrel in recent weeks after experts including the International Energy Agency said a failure by OPEC to reach a deal would mean the market might remain oversupplied for whole of 2017. Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak was due in the Qatari capital, Doha, this week for the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), which unites 12 countries including OPEC members Algeria and Iran. Even though Saudi Arabia is not a member of GECF, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih was due to travel to Doha this week for meetings with peers on the sidelines of the forum, three sources familiar with the matter said. Falih was expected to meet other energy ministers from OPEC and possibly Novak on Friday, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meetings were not made public. It was not immediately clear whether Falih would meet Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, the sources said, as there was no confirmation from Tehran yet on whether Zanganeh would attend the gas forum. Iran, which remains one of the main stumbling blocks to a final deal, has refused to cap production below 4 million barrels per day (bpd) as it seeks to regain market share lost under sanctions. Tehran said it pumped 3.92 million bpd in October. Russia has said it prefers to freeze output while OPEC wants Moscow to contribute to cuts. Iraq has also signaled it wanted its production to be calculated according to its own estimates and not the estimates of OPEC."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":66,"title":"Saudi, Russian energy ministers may meet in Doha ahead of OPEC","class":0,"body":"Saudis, Iran Said to Meet Again for Oil Talks, No Agreement Yet – Bloomberg OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose rivalry derailed an oil supply accord earlier this year, met in Vienna for a second day of discussions to prepare for wider group talks next week in Algiers. The two oil producers met at the headquarters of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna in preparation for informal discussions between energy ministers from OPEC and Russia in Algiers next week, according to two people briefed on the discussions. The two nations have not yet reached an agreement, one of the people said, asking not to be identified because the meeting was private. The rare private talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran -- OPEC’s two leading members and regional rivals -- show diplomatic efforts to secure a meaningful deal in Algiers are still under way. Prices have retreated this month amid concern there will be no serious commitment to constrain supply and all but two of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg this week predict there will be no agreement next week. This time, we believe that the environment is more conducive to some type of deal, Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets LLC, said in a note. The odds are in favor of the cartel opting for pragmatism. OPEC’s last attempt to reach a deal, which also involved Russia, the largest non-OPEC producer, fell apart in Doha in mid-April when Saudi Arabia insisted at the last minute that Iran also had to freeze production. Iran had refused because it was just starting to revive exports following the end of international sanctions. The discussions this week in Vienna marked the latest step in a flurry of shuttle diplomacy that has seen OPEC officials meet from Paris to Moscow and the Middle East. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo visited Qatar and Iran earlier this month to build consensus before the Algiers conference. President Vladimir Putin said on Sept. 2 that the producers can overcome their divisions to reach a deal. With Iran having restored lost output since international sanctions were lifted in January, the chances of a deal now are higher than at any time since OPEC launched its strategy two years ago, according to Jamie Webster, a fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York. The growing pressure from low oil prices may also give Saudi Arabia, which has depleted its cash reserves to cover a budget deficit, an incentive to compromise, according to Abhishek Deshpande, chief energy analyst at Natixis SA in London. Still, a number of obstacles to securing an agreement remain, including tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran as they continue to clash in proxy conflicts around the region from Syria to Yemen. OPEC also remains locked in a contest for market share, both between members and with competitors outside the group like U.S. shale drillers, making a deal difficult. Some OPEC members such as Iran and Iraq aim to boost capacity, while de facto group leader Saudi Arabia is pumping at record levels to maintain its sales volumes. The group is also reluctant to enter into a pact with Russia, which it doubts would deliver on any pledge to curb supply, according to Citigroup Inc."}

The meeting was held today in Makkah. The minister expressed his delight to be in Mecca and to take part in this important meeting that reflects the gravity of the events and embodies the unified Islamic stance aimed at ensuring that no person or entity can defile the sanctity of the holy lands. The Foreign Minister stated, We are seeing a major turn in events, and an unacceptable precedent committed by the criminal militias that have no respect for the sanctity of the holiest of Muslim sites. These militias did not take into account the gravity of this matter which effects more than 1.5 billion Muslims. They cannot be trusted and Muslims are not safe from their criminal agendas. Those who do not respect the sanctity of Mecca will not respect the sanctity of any nation, and this terrorist act, using ballistic missiles, is evidence of how set these militias are in their path of defiance of the international community and its resolutions and its constant efforts to ensure that any political solution not be reached in Yemen. Shaikh Khalid reiterated that the terrorist act that targeted the Holy House of Allah is a violation of all religious, humane and moral principles and that Allah Almighty prepared the valiant Royal Saudi Air Force and enabled them to destroy the missiles before reaching their target. His Excellency affirmed: every Muslim must feel great pride in what the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under the leadership of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in protecting the holy lands with the Saudi heroic soldiers in the service of their religion and country. They protect all of pilgrims and visitors and provide them with safety and piece of mind. These efforts cannot be doubted or denied. The minister reiterated Bahrain’s solidarity with Saudi Arabia in the face all forms of terrorism and against anyone that aims to destabilize it and targets its Holy sites. His Excellency reaffirmed his support to all steps undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ensure its safety and stability reiterating that any attempts targeting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s security is targeting the security of the entire Islamic world. Shaikh Khalid also affirmed that the coup militias in Yemen have become an anti-Muslim and anti-Arab tool that seeks to destabilize, terrorize and ignite sectarian hatred among all Muslims. H.E. also indicated that the Arab Coalition supporting legitimacy in Yemen will continue its efforts to enable the legitimate Yemeni government under the leadership of President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi to carry on its duties and restore peace and security to the Yemeni Republic and to reach a peaceful solution based on the principles agreed upon in the Gulf initiative, the outcomes of the national dialogue and Security Council Resolution 2216 (2015). We are not against any Yemeni side working in the best interest of the Yemen, and we will continue to stand firmly with the Yemeni people against anyone wishing to harm or prolong their suffering, the minister said. This emergency meeting of OIC’s council of foreign ministers issued a resolution backing the statement of the Ministerial Executive Committee meeting that adjourned on November 5 in Jeddah, in which the OIC member states demanded a unified stance against the attacks perpetrated by the Houthi-Saleh militias targeting the holy mosque in Makkah. The member states also considered all those standing behind and arming them as accomplices in the attacks on Islamic holy sites and active participant in efforts to ignite sectarianism and condone terrorism.The resolution focused on creating a task team from member states in the executive committee to define clear steps to ensure that such event do not reoccur as well as submit a complaint to the United Nations to take proper international action to ensure that Makkah and other Islamic holy sights are not targeted, and that the OIC’s Secretary-General carry out this resolution and report back to the council of foreign ministers as soon as possible. During the meeting, Dr. Yusuf Bin Ahmed Al-Othaimeen was appointed as the OIC’s new Secretary-General.

{"id":70,"title":"Saudi Arabian Meetings","class":0,"body":" By Western standards, meetings in Saudi Arabia can seem unusual affairs with many of the commonplace procedures and processes being ignored. Firstly, when meeting someone for the first time, do not be surprised to find yourself ushered into a room with several other people who you have never met and do not know. It is likely that the other people present do not know each other either. Your contact is then likely to give you some undivided attention before returning to a conversation he was having with someone else prior to your arrival. You might then be expected to sit in the room for a considerable period of time before your turn comes around again.This process can be very frustrating for the task-oriented, time-dominated Westerner. Meetings can drag on for hours with little, if anything, being achieved. Indeed, because of this process it can be difficult to schedule more than one meeting per day. Secondly, as relationships are all-important, many meetings can be spent in a seemingly endless round of 'getting to know you sessions.' It would be highly unusual to go into a meeting with a formal agenda and a designated chairman. Discussions can, therefore, appear disjointed with several people speaking at the same time. Try not to show annoyance or disapproval if meetings do not proceed along western patterns. Your ability to interact effectively in the eyes of your Saudi contacts will, in large measure, determine their opinion of you. It is not obligatory to give gifts when visiting a Saudi - either at the office or at home - but gifts can be helpful in the relationship building process. When offering a gift, it is likely that the gift will not be opened in front of the giver. When giving gifts be conscious of Muslim sensitivities and avoid the following."}

Ivanka Trump, who features in handout photos of the impromptu gathering, plays a significant role in managing Mr Trump’s businesses, along with his other adult children. Unlike other presidents, Mr Trump’s children are part of his transition team, which has been beset by problems since its inception. The inclusion of Mr Trump’s children - none of whom have been elected to any public office - in the political process has raised questions over how Mr Trump would deal with potential conflicts of interest between his business and political duties. As well as being a key player in her father's business empire, Ivanka Trump has her own fashion label and jewellery line, and active Twitter and Instagram accounts that promote her brand. Newly appointed National Security advsisor to Mr Trump, General Mike Flynn, was also in the meeting. It is not known how much Ms Trump participated in the discussions with Mr Abe, or if – as some observers have speculated – she was merely there as ‘decoration’. Her presence at the meeting was only revealed after the Japanese government released the pictures, thanks to a freeze-out of US journalists by the President-elect's team. But the pictures attracted attention in protocol-conscious Japan.  It's quite unusual to see a family member attending the first encounter between two leaders even if it's informal, said Yoshinobu Yamamoto, a professor of International Relations at the University of Niigata Prefecture, to AFP.  Donald Trump's most controversial quotes It indicates that she would be playing some important role in the Trump administration. But it's no surprise to see her there as she has already been involved in politics. Anyway, that's the Trump way. The move also prompted criticism among US commentators. There is literally zero reason for Ivanka Trump to be sitting in on meetings with heads of state other than her own personal benefit, Simon Maloy, political writer at Salon, wrote on Twitter. There have been unconfirmed rumours in Japan that Ms Trump could become ambassador to the country. Mr Abe was visiting Mr Trump after the President-elect made comments during the campaign suggesting Japan, officially a pacifist country, should obtain nuclear weapons and not rely so much on the US for security. Following the meeting, Mr Abe told the media he was confident Mr Trump was a trustworthy leader. Mr Trump released a separate photograph of himself and Mr Abe on Facebook. A caption said: It was a pleasure to have Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stop by my home and begin a great friendship."}

In the process, she has drawn attention to troubling questions about potential conflicts of interest that have existed since Trump began the transition process before taking power. Jared Kushner, the president-elect’s son-in-law, was also in attendance. Although Trump has denied reports of trying to obtain top secret security clearances for his children, Kushner has already emerged as one of his closest advisers and is reported to have consulted a lawyer about forgoing his pay and putting his business interests into a blind trust so he would not violate federal anti-nepotism laws. (Experts do not believe these steps would exempt him.) Ivanka has long been considered one of the greatest influences on her father’s thinking, and she and her siblings Donald Jr. and Eric have been named to the executive committee of Trump’s transition team. This isn’t the first time that the potential for conflicts of interest has arisen since Trump’s election. Because real estate businesses like the Trump empire often depend on bank loans, Trump’s involvement in those businesses while serving as president would pose a clear conflict of interest, both because of his support for banking deregulation and since many of his loans have been taken out from banks in foreign nations like China. Although Trump has tried to avoid this potential problem by promising not to run those businesses during his presidency, he has given power over his empire to his eldest three children — meaning that, even if their presence in his administration doesn’t violate anti-nepotism laws, their involvement on any level could still be illegal. Those issues aside, the meeting between Trump and Abe at least appears to have gone well. I renewed my conviction that together with Mr Trump I will be able to establish a relationship of trust, Abe said in a statement after the meeting. As an outcome of today’s discussions, I am convinced Mr Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":73,"title":"Obama and King Salman of Saudi Arabia Meet, but Deep Rifts Remain","class":0,"body":"President Obama and King Salman of Saudi Arabia spent more than two hours in a closed-door meeting that American officials said was cordial but underscored deep differences with the kingdom over Iran, human rights and the best way to fight terror. The two leaders met in Riyadh on Wednesday against the backdrop of a public debate in the United States Congress about a bill that would allow the Saudi government to be held legally responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks if it is established that any officials played a role — a charge Saudi officials have long denied. Administration officials said the issue of the Sept. 11 attacks did not come up during the meeting with the king at Erga Palace, an opulent compound lined with palm trees and well-manicured royal grounds. American officials said Mr. Obama pressed King Salman to be more open to engaging in diplomacy with Iran and to find alternatives to direct confrontation with Iranian leaders and other rivals in the region. They described the king as highly skeptical of efforts to work with Iran, the Saudis’ chief rival in the region and the backer of rebels in Yemen that the Saudis are fighting. Mr. Obama also reiterated his view that Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations needed to rely less on the United States for their security, officials said. Similar comments by Mr. Obama in a recent article in the magazine The Atlantic had increased the friction between the two governments, but American officials who attended the meeting with the king said the president did not apologize for them. In a statement released after the meeting, the White House stressed the areas of agreement between Mr. Obama and the king, saying that they reaffirmed the historic friendship and deep strategic partnership between their two nations. But the statement also noted that the two leaders merely exchanged views on several topics, suggesting a lack of agreement in those areas. The meeting exposed what one senior administration official at the meeting said were tactical differences even as the two nations broadly have similar goals on fighting terror and maintaining stability in the Middle East. The official said the Saudis preferred to confront terror threats only with force while the United States was seeking an approach that also included diplomatic efforts in the region. The sharpest exchange, the official said, came when Mr. Obama criticized the kingdom’s human rights record, raising the issues of harsh sentences and beheadings. The king repeatedly defended the Saudi justice system. Mr. Obama also met separately with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, before Thursday’s summit meeting of several Persian Gulf nations. A statement from White House officials said the two men discussed the war in Yemen, the Islamic State, Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region and the volatile political situation in Libya. The United Arab Emirates has taken an aggressive military role in the Middle East, sending troops and fighter aircraft for the war in Yemen and joining the coalition striking the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Saudis on social media were quick to note that while state television had closely covered the arrival of Persian Gulf heads of state, who were welcomed on the tarmac with embraces and kisses by King Salman, Mr. Obama had been received by a much smaller delegation, headed by the governor of Riyadh, the Saudi capital. His arrival was not shown on state television. American officials said they did not perceive the reception at the airport as a snub of Mr. Obama, noting that the Saudis had offered to host a grand lunch buffet for the president — complete with much more royal pomp and circumstance — but Mr. Obama’s schedule required him to arrive too late for that. Interactive Feature | G.C.C. Essential Facts A quick look at what the Gulf Cooperation Council is, the size and economic strength of its member states and some of its key initiatives. Mr. Obama arrived in the kingdom barely a day after publicly expressing support for releasing the Sept. 11 documents. Those documents — 28 pages of intelligence from a congressional report — have fueled suspicions for years that some Saudi officials played a role in the attack. Just before leaving for his six-day trip to the Middle East and Europe, Mr. Obama told CBS News that he hoped that the confidential section of the congressional report would be released soon, though he cautioned that the information it contained might not be conclusive. Before Mr. Obama’s trip, White House officials repeatedly acknowledged tensions between the two governments. The Obama administration’s deal with Iran to limit that country’s nuclear program has unnerved the kingdom. The president’s decision not to order airstrikes against the forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in 2013 was viewed in the kingdom as hesitation in the face of an implacable foe. Aides had said they hoped that the common cause of combating terrorism and regional instability would be enough to ensure a productive meeting with the king. For their part, Saudi officials used the meeting to gauge the extent of change in their decades-old alliance with the United States, while also knowing that Mr. Obama’s days in the White House are counting down. The Saudis enjoyed a good strategic relationship that kept the region stable and allowed them to benefit from their wealth, so when this changed, there was a psychological response, said Awadh al-Badi, a scholar at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh. This is the defining moment: Is it the country, or is it Obama? If it is the country, then things here need to change. After the Gulf summit meeting on Thursday, Mr. Obama will head to London, where he will also try to mend fences after he suggested in The Atlantic article that Europeans were free riders in securing the Continent. And he specifically criticized the British prime minister, David Cameron, as being distracted during the 2011 military campaign that led to the ouster and killing of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya. The president is also likely to weigh in on the fate of the European Union as British voters prepare to decide in a referendum whether the country will leave the bloc. Mr. Obama has said he opposes a British exit. Mr. Obama will conclude his trip with a visit to Germany, where he plans to tour the country’s largest industrial trade show and deliver a speech about the broad challenges still facing Europe. Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president’s deputy national security adviser, said the speech presented an opportunity for Mr. Obama to step back and talk about the future of Europe even as it faces terrorism, a refugee crisis, a continued tug-of-war with Russia over Ukraine and economic slowdowns."}

Announcing the Kingdom’s participation at the forthcoming conference, Information and Technology Minister Mohammed Al-Suwaiyel told Bangladeshi Ambassador Golam Moshi during a meeting at his office on Thursday that he admired the socioeconomic development of Bangladesh, particularly in the IT sector. The Minister said that the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on IT cooperation between the two countries has been finalized and would be signed soon depending on the convenience of the two parties. It could be signed by next week when the deputy minister will be in Bangladesh, if the final authorization is given by the Saudi Council of Ministers, he noted. Al-Suwaiyel also underlined the importance of regular and increased interaction between IT professionals of both countries to enhance better understanding of the needs of IT sector and its services. Speaking to Arab News following the meeting, Moshi said that under the new agreement, there will be new areas of bilateral cooperation in the IT sector such as in the fields of expatriate welfare, telemedicine, immigration and labor recruitment. Ambassador Moshi recalled that the last visit of Bangladeshi IT Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak in October 2015 created a platform for further cooperation between the two countries in this growing sector. During the meeting, there were extensive discussions about cooperation in the IT sector through the sharing of experiences, and through training and research collaboration among IT professionals of both countries for the benefit of the citizens of both nations, he noted. Moshi enumerated the recent initiatives and measures taken for the improvement in the IT sector in Bangladesh under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and sought the support of the Kingdom for further improvement of the IT industry in Bangladesh. This vision for a digitalized Bangladesh is being vigorously pursued by the IT affairs adviser to the prime minister, Sajeeb Wajed Joy, he said. The ambassador said Bangladesh has earmarked a space for Saudi and GCC investors in the recently launched Hightech Park for IT industries in Bangladesh. During the discussions, Deputy Minister Al-Otaibi was also present on the Saudi side, while Maryland Nazrul Islam, deputy chief of the mission, and Abul Hassan, counsellor for economic affairs, represented the Bangladesh embassy in Riyadh."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":80,"title":"Senior executives from listed Saudi firms attend London investment forum ","class":0,"body":"Saudi Arabia’s international capital markets charm offensive continues this week, with a series of high-level meetings with London’s investment community. Senior executives from corporations such as Sabic, Saudi Telecom and insurer Tawuniya, together with representatives from the Tadawul and Capital Market Authority (CMA), kicked off a series of meetings yesterday during a two-day investment forum hosted by Morgan Stanley. The meetings follow similar events last month in New York, sponsored by JP Morgan. A third event, hosted by HSBC, is scheduled to take place in Hong Kong during the first quarter of next year. Increasing foreign participation in Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is among the key provisions of the country’s ambitious National Transformation Programme. Saudi Arabia stunned international investors in January when it announced plans to list a stake in oil major Saudi Aramco by early 2018, in what is expected to be the largest IPO in history. In recent months the country has significantly relaxed requirements for foreign investors, announced plans for a secondary index and changes to settlement cycles, and last week introduced regulations for trading Reits for the first time. An IPO in the Tadawul itself is expected to be launched by 2018. Investor interest in the Saudi capital markets is very strong, as shown by the number attending this conference in London, said the CMA vice chairman, Mohammed Elkuwaiz. This reflects both the size of the country’s equity market, which is the largest in the Mena region, and its continuing integration in global markets. The Tadawul has been one of the world’s best-performing stock indexes over the past month, following Saudi Arabia’s record US$17.5 billion bond issue last month. However, the bourse remains 11 per cent lower for the year, prompted in part by a 13 per cent slump in January following a collapse in global oil prices. Foreign investors held 4.16 per cent of total market capitalisation as of Thursday, according to data from the Tadawul."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":81,"title":" Saudi king will not attend Obama-Gulf summit","class":0,"body":"King Salman of Saudi Arabia will not be attending a landmark summit hosted by President Barack Obama, amid worries over US-Iran nuclear negotiations. Obama had invited six Gulf Arab leaders to the presidential retreat at Camp David, seeking to shore up wavering trust while Washington negotiates with Tehran.  Only two heads of state are now expected to attend the Thursday meeting. Saudi Arabia's embassy in Washington said Sunday that recently named Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef would instead lead the Saudi delegation to the meeting.  The king's son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who has driven recent military operations in Yemen, will also attend.  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Salman would miss the meeting due to the timing of the summit, the scheduled humanitarian ceasefire in Yemen and the opening of the King Salman Centre for Humanitarian Aid, according to the embassy statement. Oman's Sultan Qaboos has been ill, and diplomats said Muscat will be represented by the deputy prime minister. Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan will attend, according to diplomats, as United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan is also unwell. As late as Friday, US officials said they had expected Salman to come to Washington, before learning of the change in plan. This is not in response to any substantive issue, insisted one senior US administration official. Bahrain's King Hamad bin Issa al-Khalifa will also miss the meeting, officials indicated Sunday, with the crown prince coming instead. That means Obama will likely meet only the leaders of Kuwait and Qatar.  Iran worries The summit comes amid unease over Washington's nuclear talks with Tehran and perceived US disengagement in the region under Obama's administration. US officials stress there is no broader detente or a de facto blessing of Iran's destabilising support for proxy groups in the region. They also point to the presence of the US 5th Fleet in Bahrain and a military base and command centre in Qatar as evidence of sustained engagement. But Gulf states look anxiously at Iran's growing influence in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. In the last two years….we have seen an increase in Iranian activity in the region, we are seeing more arms shipments, more money…. said a Gulf diplomat.  No permission needed Already calculations about US engagement are changing actions on the ground. Our Gulf allies aren't waiting for US action anymore, they don't think it's coming soon enough, or strong enough. Or at all, said Lori Plotkin Boghardt, a former CIA analyst now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Officials from the region and beyond point to the Arab-led intervention in Yemen as a harbinger of things to come. Yemen shows you that we will not wait for permission anymore, one Gulf official said. But Yemen brings significant problems for Obama, which he will not want to see repeated elsewhere.  His administration has misgivings about Saudi Arabia's military action to degrade Houthi militia, which have cut through government forces. They have pressed Saudi Arabia to ease an air campaign that appears to have had a limited impact beyond destroying missiles that could reach the Saudi homeland, and which may have simply escalated the conflict. Around 1,200 people have been killed in the Yemen war.  US support for a humanitarian pause in Saudi military operations, and backing for talks leading to a unity government and prising away former Yemen president Ali Abdullah Saleh from the houthis could all help Saudi Arabia.  Gulf leaders will also come with a wish list of weapons to counter the threat from Iran. Officials say the Gulf leaders will seek advanced US weapons systems including F-35 stealth fighters to help establish an Arab qualitative military edge as Iran grows its advanced missile capabilities. Russia recently agreed to sell Iran the S-300 air defence missile system capable of shooting down fighters currently used by Gulf states.  US backing for Saudi or Emirati nuclear programmes are off the table, but missile defence is not. But diplomats warn that with existing US military commitments to Israel, Japan, Egypt and Turkey, determining who gets what weapons and when, while maintaining a favourable military balance, will be fraught."}

The two men both gave positive feedback about the 90-minute conversation but after years of clashing, it was clear there was some tension between them.  Patti Wood, a body language expert, analysed the two men, concluding that Mr Obama was resigned and not hopeful, while Mr Trump was serious and perhaps fearful. Trump blames media for 'inciting' continuing protestsSix reasons why Barack Obama would have beaten Donald Trump in 2016Donald Trump is the world's most successful salesman Hillary Clinton got millions more votes than Donald Trump If you look at the seating position - their lower legs, they are both in the male, alpha position saying ‘I am a man’, Ms Wood told the Daily Mail. Mr Obama had his legs much further apart than Mr Trump’s, which Ms Wood claims shows the current President is subconsciously exerting dominance.  The hand position of the two men, in particular Mr Trump’s, also proved to be interesting. The President-elect was doing the downward prayer position while sitting beside Mr Obama. My read is that he has learned something he didn't know before. It's a tentative hand position, Ms Wood said. Trump holds his own hands as he begins speaking which is an indication he needs to comfort himself.  Mr Obama was resting his arms on his legs which apparently indicated he was weary.  World reaction to President Trump: In pictures  There is a part where he says he has been encouraged. As he says it he closes his eyes. I call that an eye block. That tells me he doesn't feel totally encouraged, Ms Wood told the Daily Mail. Obama was extremely fatigued, resigned and not hopeful but very presidential. Trump was serious and showed indications he heard information that made him fearful. Mr Trump took to Twitter after the meeting to quash any rumours of tension between the pair.  A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry.

{"id":87,"title":" Obama meets with Pakistani prime minister","class":0,"body":" U.S. President Barack Obama meets Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 22. Photo by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama welcomed Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to the White House Thursday with talk of strengthening U.S. ties to a key player in brokering peace in Afghanistan. Obama’s meeting with Sharif came one week after the president reversed his pledge to pull American troops out of Afghanistan before he leaves office and as the U.S. is turning to two core political dimensions of the war: obstacles to a negotiated peace, and Pakistan as a Taliban sanctuary. The leaders were also expected to discuss touch on U.S. financial assistance to Islamabad and the prospects for Pakistani acceptance of limits on the scope of its nuclear weapons arsenal. Major breakthroughs are seen as unlikely. The United States and Pakistan have a long-standing relationship, work and cooperate on a whole host of issues. Not just on security matters, but also on economic and scientific and educational affairs, Obama said in brief remarks to reporters before the private meeting. We’re looking forward to using this meeting as an opportunity to further deepen the relationship between the United States and Pakistan. Sitting next to the president in the Oval Office, Sharif agreed he hoped to to further strengthen and solidify this relationship. The visit highlights the complexities of a 14-year-old Afghan war that Obama inherited in 2009, escalated a year later with a surge of American troops designed in part to force the Taliban to the negotiating table, and then vowed to end before he hands off to a new president in January 2017. Instead, Obama announced last week that he plans to keep 5,500 U.S. troops there beyond 2016 to continue training and advising Afghan forces and to hunt al-Qaida terrorists. Obama’s decision was an acknowledgement that the war’s end game is not going according to plan. The U.S.-Pakistan relationship has been rocky over the years, not least because of U.S. concerns about the growth of Pakistan’s secretive nuclear arsenal. The U.S. is interested in moving Pakistan toward an arrangement limiting the scope of its nuclear stockpile, but there are few signs that any breakthrough is in sight. In a new report released Thursday, two authoritative nuclear analysts estimated that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons stockpile has increased to between 110 and 130 warheads from an estimated 90 to 110 in 2011. The analysts, Hans M. Kristensen and Robert S. Norris, foresee it possibly expanding further to 220 to 250 warheads in another 10 years. That would make Pakistan the world’s fifth largest nuclear weapons state behind the United States, Russia, China and France. In a report being published by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Kristensen and Norris said Pakistan appears to have six nuclear-capable ballistic missiles in its arsenal, three more than in 2011. At least two other nuclear-capable ballistic missiles and two new cruise missiles are in development, they said, adding that they see signs that Pakistan also is developing a nuclear weapon — possibly a cruise missile — for deployment on submarines. In making his troop announcement last Thursday, Obama noted that Pakistani forces have squeezed remnants of al-Qaida into neighboring Afghanistan. Pressure from Pakistan has resulted in more al-Qaida coming into Afghanistan, Obama said. Evidence of that was a little noticed statement last week by the U.S. military in Kabul about a large-scale U.S.-Afghan air and ground raid against what it called a well-established al-Qaida training camp in the southern province of Kandahar. The U.S. called it one of the largest such counterterrorism operations every undertaken in Afghanistan. In noting his coming meeting with Sharif, Obama also said sanctuaries for the Taliban and other terrorists must end. I will continue to urge all parties in the region to press the Taliban to return to peace talks and to do their part in pursuit of the peace that Afghans deserve, he said. The Associated Press reported last week that some U.S. analysts believed a Pakistani intelligence operative was running a command center for the Taliban out of the hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, that was hit by an American gunship. Sharif met Wednesday with Secretary of State John Kerry. State Department spokesman John Kirby said they discussed Obama’s troop announcement, noting that an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process is the surest way to end violence and ensure lasting stability in Afghanistan and in the region. Sharif said Oct. 10 that his government was trying to revive stalled peace talks between representatives of the Afghan government and the Taliban. He said Islamabad was once again prepared to play mediator to end the Taliban’s battle to regain power in Kabul. The Taliban ruled the country until U.S. forces invaded in October 2001. Kabul accuses Pakistan of playing a double game by cooperating with Washington but also sheltering Taliban leaders. Pakistan hosted a landmark set of preliminary meetings between Afghan officials and the Taliban in July. But a second round of scheduled talks was postponed after the Afghan government revealed that Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar had died in a Pakistani hospital two years ago. Pakistan denies that it sponsors the Taliban or other terrorist groups such as the Pakistan-based Haqqani network."}

The meeting wasn’t about any single topic (though the Affordable Care Act, its impending March 31 deadline for Open Enrollment, and a quick brainstorm on how to disseminate unbiased information about the initiative was on the agenda), but focused more on establishing an open dialogue between the Oval Office and outstanding members of the YouTube community. The hope among the attendees was the gathering will be the first of many and that this recently established YouTube brain trust of sorts can help the White House, President Obama, and all future POTUSes more easily navigate the quickly evolving new media landscape. It’s not that the President doesn’t know the importance of online video. Since way back in November 2008 when he was still President-Elect, Obama’s filmed weekly, online video Fireside Chats where he addresses the camera and informs the online video masses on the current state of the union. It’s that the President fully realizes online video’s potential and knows he and his office could be using the medium more effectively. Never before in the history of the world has there been a more direct way for the President of the United States to inform and speak to his fellow Americans, but never before have his fellow Americans been so distracted from hearing his message. It was one thing for Franklin D. Roosevelt to address radio audiences in an era before the mass adoption of television. It’s another for Obama to fight for viewership from a fickle audience on a platform that sees over 100 hours of video uploaded every minute. And that’s where prominent YouTubers come into play. They know how to be heard by the next generation of Americans on the medium with which they feel most comfortable. The meeting was orchestrated by the aforementioned Meyer, who reached out to his JASH co-worker Kellison about organizing an in-person conversation between exceptional YouTubers and the President. Kellison, who is on the White House’s Entertainment Advisory Council, helped put the wheels in motion while Meyer reached out to established members of the online video community. The get-together ended with a trip to the Oval Office, where Obama gave all the attendees a brief history of the room and pointed everyone’s attention towards his 1849 model of Samuel Morse’s telegraph. He noted how the piece of machinery was the start of the internet before snapping a photo with some of online video’s most recognizable and influential personalities."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":89,"title":" President Obama Meets Civil Rights Icon Ruby Bridges","class":0,"body":" Ruby Bridges made history in 1964 when she attended a formerly all-white school. She visited the White House to see a painting of her historic first day by Norman Rockwell that is on display outside the Oval Office through the summer of 2011 When Ruby Bridges visited the Oval Office on July 15, President Obama told her, I think it's fair to say that if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be here today. November 14, 2010 marked the 50th anniversary of six-year-old Ruby's history-changing walk to the William Franz Public School in New Orleans as part of court-ordered integration in 1960. Six years after the 1954 United States Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education declared that state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students were unconstitutional, this event represented a victory for the American Civil Rights Movement. Bridges was at the White House to see how a painting commemorating this personal and historic milestone looks hanging on the wall outside of the Oval Office. American artist Norman Rockwellwas criticized by some when this painting first appeared on the cover of Look magazine on January 14,1964; now the iconic portrait will be on display throughout the summer of 2011 in one of the most exalted locations in the country. President Barack Obama, Ruby Bridges, and representatives of the Norman Rockwell Museum view Rockwell’s The Problem We All Live With, hanging in a West Wing hallway near the Oval Office, July 15, 2011. Bridges is the girl portrayed the painting. The President likes pictures that tell a story and this painting fits that bill. Norman Rockwell was a longtime supporter of the goals of equality and tolerance. In his early career, editorial policies governed the placement of minorities in his illustrations (restricting them to service industry positions only).  However, in 1963 Rockwell confronted the issue of prejudice head-on with this, one of his most powerful paintings. Inspired by the story of Ruby Bridges and school integration, the image featured a young African-American girl being escorted to school by four U.S. marshals amidst signs of protest and fearful ignorance. The painting ushered in a new era in Rockwell’s career and remains an important national symbol of the struggle for racial equality. The Problem We All Live With by Norman Rockwell (1894-1978). Oil on canvas, 1963. On loan to the White House from the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. The painting will be on display outside the Oval Office from June 22 – October 31, 2011 before rejoining other works from the museum in a traveling exhibition, American Chronicles: The Art of Norman Rockwell. (Licensed by Norman Rockwell Licensing Company, Niles, IL) Rockwell received letters of both praise and criticism from Look readers unused to such direct social commentary from the illustrator. Rockwell would revisit the theme of civil rights in several other illustrations from the period.

{"id":91,"title":" Obama Meets Race Riot Advocate At White House, Asks Cops To Be Nice To Him","class":0,"body":" After hijacking a memorial for police officers slain by an anti-white, anti-cop racist to push his race and gun agenda – all the while claiming to be a uniter – President Obama held a meeting on the police and race relations at the White House. One of his most important guests: race-riot fan Deray McKesson, who made a name for himself by stoking rage over the justified shooting of Michael Brown, then parlaying that into a career as a Black Lives Matter provocateur. McKesson has spoken about Black Lives Matter at Yale University, where he approved an article titled In Defense of Looting. McKesson came to the White House directly after getting himself arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana for the cameras. McKesson supposedly chastised Obama for not visiting Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where Alton Sterling was killed by police after allegedly grabbing for his gun, or Falcon Heights, Minnesota, where circumstances surrounding the police killing of Philando Castile are still unknown. He even told Obama that he should visit Ferguson – the site of riots championed by McKesson over a false racial narrative. Obama, in turn, kowtowed to the race-baiter, asking Louisiana police to give McKesson back his backpack. Here’s how that conversation went: Obama: We should get Deray his backpack back. I mean, I can get you a new book bag. But I have a felling you want your bookbag back, huh? McKesson: Yes, I would like that. After the meeting with the race arsonist, Obama then appeared before the press and ripped into the cops: Not only are there very real problems, but there are still deep divisions about how to solve these problems. There is no doubt that police departments still feel embattled and unjustly accused. And there is no doubt that minority communities, communities of color, still feel like it just takes too long to do what's right. He then predicted, I think it is fair to say we will see more tension between police and communities this month, next month, next year, for quite some time. Of course, it’s his job to stop that sort of thing. But he won’t. He’s a racial divider both by ideology and for political gain. And more black people will die thanks to those divisions, as police pull out of high crime minority communities to avoid the wrath of the left. And more cops will die, too, as anti-police sentiment metastasizes."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":92,"title":" Obama meets influential young Saudi prince to improve relations","class":0,"body":" Saudi Arabian Prince Mohammed bin Salman has become driving force behind economic reforms, more activist foreign policy Saudi Arabia, Barack Obama, US, Mohammed bin Salman US President Barack Obama hosted youthful Saudi Arabian Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House on Friday, underscoring his guest's meteoric rise and increasingly pivotal role in managing strained US-Saudi ties. The 30-year-old deputy crown prince, who has become the driving force behind economic reform and a more activist Saudi foreign policy, swept into the West Wing with a gaggle of advisers for hour-long talks. Bin Salman, the king's son and the country's defence minister, has met the biggest of Washington's big hitters during a week-long visit. He held talks with the CIA director, the secretaries of state, defense, treasury, commerce and energy as well as leading members of Congress. His meeting with Obama took place in the Oval Office, a rare honor for a non-head of state, one not afforded to the Dalai Lama earlier in the week. The meetings were very, very positive. I believe there was a commonality in terms of visions and views, said Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. Experts and security officials have expressed fears that Saudi Arabia may face collapse if bin Salman fails with his policies and reforms. It's him or it's ISIS, an anonymous Saudi expert told NBC news. [Bin Salman] has to win, said a US intelligence source. It's that simple. US officials and experts believe that bin Salman is primed to become the next king, despite technically being ranked in succession behind his cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who is seriously ill, said Bruce Riedel, a former intelligence officer for the Middle East. He is notionally number three in the hierarchy, but effectively he's number one, said Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute, a think-tank focused on the Middle East. The king prefers his son and wants his son to be king, Henderson said. We've put a lot of markers down on Mohammed bin Nayef. It's the smart move to do the same with bin Salman. It's an opportunity to get to know him, Riedel said. For the White House, bin Salman is a relative unknown, while bin Nayef has been the go-to royal on counterterrorism for years. Gregory Gause of Texas A&M University said bin Salman's visit was an effort by him to be recognised. The meeting came amid strained ties between the US and Saudi Arabia over Iran, war in Yemen and the seemingly imminent release of a US dossier about alleged Saudi Arabian links to the 11 September 2001 attacks. However, Riedel told NBC news that several officials are concerned about his bin Salman's recklessness. As minister of defence, bin Salman got his country into expensive wars, including intervention in Yemen that reportedly cost the kingdom up to $200m per day until a ceasefire took effect. He’s also the country’s economic czar, and is seen as a chief architect in the strategy to pump oil as a way to crash oil prices, which has caused cuts in the country’s social services, including subsidies for Saudi citizens. While in power, Saudi’s relations with Iran have worsened, and bin Salman reportedly approved the execution of influential Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr. Amid disagreement over the US nuclear deal with Iran, economic reform appears to be a much-needed issue that could bring Riyadh and Washington together. High on the agenda was bin Salman's effort to overhaul Saudi Arabia's state-dominated and oil-dependent economy, bringing in the private sector and creating jobs for the country's youthful population. Given their huge investment in education over the last decade, if they are not able to move away from a state-run economy and develop a private sector, you are not going to have the jobs that young people need, said former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia James Smith. Amid disagreement over the US nuclear deal with Iran, economic reform appears to be a much-needed issue that could bring Riyadh and Washington together.  The longstanding US-Saudi relationship, built on an exchange of American security backing for a reliable supply of Saudi oil, has become strained as the US has gained greater energy independence while reaching a historic agreement with the Saudis' bitter foe in the region, Iran. Obama's White House has repeatedly argued that Saudi Arabia's most pressing security task is internal reform to put the autocratic state on a more stable and sustainable footing. During the Oval Office meeting, the president commended the deputy crown prince's commitment to reforming Saudi Arabia's economy, according to the White House. The meeting also addressed another of bin Salman's signature policies - Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, which has been a point of contention between the White House and the royal court. The US has aided and publically backed the operation to push back against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who took over the capital, Sanaa. The war signalled Saudi Arabia's willingness to tackle Iranian influence in the region, but Obama's administration has been repeatedly embarrassed by the killing of civilians and concerned that while the war has dragged on al-Qaeda has been allowed to grow. More than 6,400 Yemenis have been killed since the intervention started 15 months ago, the majority of them civilians. There are signs that the war may be winding down and Saudi Arabia and its allies may be shifting focus to tackling al-Qaeda, even though the Houthis remain in control of most of the central and northern highlands as well as the Red Sea coast. The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday announced its war is over in Yemen, although it left open the possibility of a continued counterterrorism role. The president welcomed Saudi Arabia's commitment to concluding a political settlement of the conflict, the White House said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":93,"title":" Washington Health Policy Week in Review","class":0,"body":"Obama Meets with Insurers as Marketplaces Face Challenges President Barack Obama met with major health insurance company officials Monday, commending those who will participate in the health law marketplaces after a summer marked by headlines about dramatic withdrawals from the market and rising premiums. The president and other administration officials underscored the importance of continuing to participate in the marketplaces and asked for the CEOs' input on how to make the marketplaces stronger, according to a White House official. Administration officials have had yearly meetings with similar groups of CEOs ahead of the law's previous three open enrollment periods. The meeting comes after two major insurance companies, UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Aetna Inc., announced a massive exodus from most of the marketplaces in which they were selling products, citing financial losses. Republicans also have hammered the 2010 health overhaul in campaign ads and congressional hearings this year, focusing on premium increases that could top double digits, in percentage terms, in some counties. In a Monday letter to every participating insurance company, Obama highlighted the historic drop in the uninsured rate that has been driven by the law. He also acknowledged its issues. We know that this progress has not been without challenges. Most new enterprises have growing pains and opportunities for improvement. The Marketplace, while strong, is no exception, he wrote, according to the letter provided by a White House official. He pointed to recent regulatory changes intended to strengthen the exchanges, adding the administration will continue to listen and identify opportunities to [improve the law]. These efforts underscore my commitment to making sure the Marketplace continues to work long after I leave office. In addition to Obama, the meeting also was attended by Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, senior advisor Valerie Jarrett and Deputy Chief of Staff for Implementation Kristie Canegallo, and executives from 13 health plans or plan associations. The companies included Humana Inc., Cigna Corp., Highmark Inc., Molina Healthcare Inc. and a large array of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, as well as representatives from America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBS). BCBSA President Scott Serota, who attended the meeting, said in a statement that his group will continue to work with the administration to develop rules that encourage people to be continuously insured so they get the ongoing care they need."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":94,"title":" Yemen Peace Effort Falters as Houthis Refuse to Attend Talks","class":0,"body":"AL MUKALLA, Yemen — Peace talks aimed at ending Yemen’s civil war that were set to begin on Monday faltered before they could start, when delegates representing Yemen’s Houthi rebels refused to attend. The setback followed several aborted cease-fires and a previous round of failed negotiations to end Yemen’s 14-month conflict. The latest talks, in the Persian Gulf state of Kuwait, were supposed to bring together the Houthis and delegates from Yemen’s government, which was driven from power by the Houthis last year. There is growing international alarm at the civilian toll from the hostilities, as well as frustration at the continuation of a conflict effectively locked in a stalemate since last summer. More than 6,200 people have been killed, and most of the population in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest state, requires some form of humanitarian assistance. The war has shaken the Middle East, aggravating regional rivalries while drawing foreign troops to Yemen, including Persian Gulf soldiers who are part of a Saudi Arabia-led military coalition fighting on the side of the Yemeni government. A power vacuum has empowered the country’s powerful affiliate of Al Qaeda, allowing it to seize territory, money and arms. The Houthis said they did not attend the talks because of what they described as violations of a shaky truce that was supposed to begin last week but never fully took hold. Abdurahman Alahnomi, a spokesman for the Houthis, said that the delegation will travel after it ensures that the other party commits to the cease-fires. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, the United Nations special envoy to Yemen, who has been shuttling between the combatants for months, said in a statement that the talks were delayed. He scolded the Houthis and their allies, saying he hoped they would not miss this opportunity that could save Yemen the loss of more lives. There had been optimism about the talks. Both sides had made conciliatory statements, and there was a feeling that the combatants were beginning to see diminishing returns from the war. Yet no breakthrough was expected. The negotiations were designed to ease the violence and confront manageable issues, like prisoner exchanges, in hopes of creating a climate for a broader political dialogue. Even that limited agenda was contested. A Houthi delegate said the group was opposed to a proposal that would allow the government, led by President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to return to the capital, Sana. The Houthis favored a consensus government with a new prime minister, with Mr. Hadi remaining as a figurehead until a new president could be elected, according to the delegate, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the rebels. A sense of urgency surrounded the negotiations in Kuwait, because of the hair-trigger nature of the violence and because neither the Houthis nor the government fully controlled the constellation of armed groups on the ground. April Longley Alley, who researches Yemen for the International Crisis Group, said that several powerful political figures on both sides of the conflict could scuttle the diplomacy. Most prominent among them is former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who stepped down in 2012 but has retained his influence — malign, his critics say. Mr. Saleh and his loyalists have been allied with the Houthis throughout the war. But his exclusion from the talks that led to the cease-fire last week, as well as doubts about his political future in Yemen, meant that he has the incentive to be a spoiler — a dangerous one, Ms. Alley wrote in a blog post on the crisis group’s website. On Monday, both sides reported fresh violations of the tentative truce, including airstrikes and clashes in Marib province, east of Sana. Beyond the negotiations in Kuwait, tangled questions about Yemen’s political future are looming, including the demand by a southern Yemeni movement for an independent state. North Yemen and South Yemen were separate countries until 1990. After unification, southerners complained that they were being marginalized by the country’s northern leaders, leading to a movement calling openly for secession. The current war has hardened those demands. Southerners, with backing from the Saudi-led coalition, successfully routed the Houthis and Mr. Saleh’s forces from much of the south, making them less willing to relinquish control to any central authority. The secessionists held huge rallies in the southern port city of Aden for a second consecutive day on Monday — to ensure that the delegates in Kuwait understood they would not yield, said Nasser al-Yazidi, a leading figure in the Southern Movement. If the government ignores their demands, the southerners will confront them, like we did with Saleh and the Houthis, he said."}

Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, attend a protest against Saudi-led airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, Yemen's Shiite rebels have reversed an earlier decision to boycott U.N.-sponsored peace talks designed to find a way to end the war in the impoverished Arab nation and their delegation was on its way Wednesday, heading to the negotiations due to take place in Kuwait. The peace talks will begin on Thursday in Kuwait, Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman for the U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon, told reporters later Wednesday. Representatives of the rebels, also known as Houthis, and their allies left the capital, Sanaa, to neighboring Oman en route to Kuwait. In a statement issued late Tuesday, senior Houthi leader Mahdi al-Mashat said the movement has received assurances from Kuwait and Oman that there will be no more violations of a week-long cease-fire by the Saudi-led coalition, which has been carrying out airstrikes against the Houthis. We reserve the right to suspend our participation if the promises are not kept, said al-Mashat. He and Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdel-Salam are the most senior delegates in the rebel team. The forces of aggression then will have to assume full responsibility for the consequences of their failure to honor their commitments, al-Mashat added. The talks, which had originally been scheduled to get underway Monday, are aimed at finding ways to resolve the year-long conflict between Yemen's internationally recognized government, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, and the Houthis and their allies. A U.N.-brokered cease-fire announced earlier this month has sought to facilitate the negotiations in Kuwait, though it has repeatedly been breached by both sides. Along with Sanaa, the cities of Taiz, Marib and Jouf have seen most of the cease-fire violations. Security officials said Wednesday that coalition warplanes bombed Houthi positions in Taiz and the province of Marib at dawn Wednesday. There were no reports on casualties and damage immediately available. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Yemen's war has killed thousands and displaced 2.4 million people while the Houthis still retain control in much of the country's northern regions - including the capital, Sanaa. The conflict has also fueled secessionist aspirations among the Southerners' for independence, which they had before Yemen was unified in 1990."}

However, in the absence of an announcement from the rebels, government spokesman Rajih Badi was unsure the rebels would attend. The talks may not take place, he told AFP. Yemen's exiled government of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi said in a statement late Thursday that a rebel pullback from areas seized since last year -- as outlined by a UN resolution -- remained a precondition for negotiations. At a meeting in Riyadh, Yemeni government officials approved their participation in talks aimed at implementing Resolution 2216, the statement said. The UN's special envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, said Thursday that both the government and Huthi rebels had agreed to take part in negotiations that will convene in the region next week. Hadi's government called on Cheikh Ahmed to strive for a clear, public commitment from the Huthis and allied forces to withdraw from areas they have seized, including the Yemeni capital. Previous diplomatic efforts to end Yemen's more than five-month war failed to bear fruit and a Saudi-led coalition backing Hadi has waged daily air strikes against the rebels. On Friday, at least 20 people were killed as rebels fired Katyusha rockets at a busy market in the eastern city of Marib, medics and witnesses said. The attack came hours after a Saudi-led coalition air strike killed seven rebels in Marib. And powerful explosions rocked Al-Hassaba area of Sanaa, where an arms depot was targeted by coalition warplanes, witnesses said. Medics said at least s even people were killed.

We accepted the invitation of the United Nations to go to the negotiating table in Geneva without preconditions, said Daifallah al-Shami, a politburo member of the militia's political wing. Speaking to AFP, he added that they will not accept conditions from other parties. Ezzedine al-Isbahi, information minister of the Yemeni government exiled in Riyadh, said it would send a delegation to the talks provisionally scheduled for 14 June. UN envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed told the Security Council on Wednesday that the government had agreed to attend but that he was still in consultation with the rebels. The government agreed to participate in the Geneva talks, Isbahi told AFP. He said the meeting would involve consultations on implementing Resolution 2216. The April Security Council resolution imposed an arms embargo on the Houthi militia and demanded they relinquish seized territory. After overrunning the capital Sanaa in September, the Houthis seized much of the country, prompting a Saudi-led bombing campaign that began on 26 March in support of exiled President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi. Saudi Arabia feared the Houthis would take over all of Yemen and move it into the orbit of the kingdom's regional rival Iran. Pro-government forces have been fighting the militia and their allies in a war which the United Nations says has killed 2,200 people and forced more than half a million from their homes. Catastrophic' crisis The Security Council this week heard a report from new UN aid chief Stephen O'Brien who described Yemen's humanitarian crisis as catastrophic, with 20 million civilians - 80 percent of the population - in need of aid. Confirmation that the government and the rebels would both send delegations to Switzerland follows a flurry of diplomacy after the United Nations was forced to abandon plans to convene talks last week. Hadi's government refused to attend unless the rebels pulled back from at least some of the territory they have seized in line with Resolution 2216. On Tuesday, Washington said Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Anne Patterson had met Houthi representatives in neighbouring Oman to try to persuade them to join the proposed Geneva conference. Patterson also travelled to Saudi Arabia for talks with the kingdom's leaders as well as Hadi, who fled Yemen in March when the rebels moved on the port city of Aden which had become his sanctuary. UN envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed met with Hadi this week after holding talks in rebel-held Sanaa. The US talks with the rebels followed a mission to Muscat last week by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. A diplomat in Oman said the Houthis told the US they want a halt to the Saudi-led bombing campaign and unrestricted access for deliveries of humanitarian aid. Muscat has good ties with both Tehran and Washington, and has often played the role of mediator. It is the only member of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council not to have joined the air war against the Houthi militia."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":98,"title":" Liberal Democrat peer to attend controversial conference in Syria","class":0,"body":"British delegates, including a Liberal Democrat peer, are to take part in a controversial conference in Damascus this weekend organised by the father-in-law of President Bashar al-Assad, which critics say is little more than a Syrian regime propaganda exercise. The British Syrian Society has organised a two-day workshop, starting on Sunday, on the ramifications of the war in Syria. Speakers include Raymond Asquith (Lord Oxford), a Lib Dem peer, alongside British academics and a range of figures from Assad’s government. Several high-profile UK journalists are also taking part. The society was set up in 2000 in London, and its chairman was Fawaz Akhras, a London-based cardiologist, whose daughter Asma married Assad later that same year. However, the society went into hibernation after Syria’s bloody civil war erupted in 2011. Since then 400,000 people have died, most killed by Assad’s forces. The international conference – organised by Akhras – is the society’s first recent event. It appears to be a sign of the regime’s growing confidence that it is winning the battle against Syria’s rebel groups and will ultimately prevail. The event follows the first public interview for five years by Asma al-Assad, shown on Russian state TV earlier this month. Chris Doyle, the head of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, said it was a mistake for Lord Oxford and others to take part in what was a regime PR exercise. Asquith is chairing the opening session, titled: The background of the war in Syria. The regime is trying to energise its public diplomacy and public outreach in Britain. They are trying to maintain this is a neutral conference. It’s simply not. The speakers are senior regime figures, plus others who are extremely supportive, Doyle said. He added: The British delegates are merely reinforcing the regime’s narrative that it’s business as usual as they [the regime] carpet-bomb Aleppo and other Syrian cities. It’s wrong to take part. If you are involved in track two diplomacy, fine. If you are going on some sort of propaganda conference, no way. I don’t think the FCO [Foreign Office] will be happy about this. Other British speakers include Maj Gen John Holmes, a former British special forces officer, who runs a private intelligence business, and Kamal Alam, a research analyst at the defence and security thinktank Rusi. The Lib Dems said the party was unaware of the Damascus trip. It said: Lord Oxford was part of the Foreign Office for many decades before he became a Lib Dem peer, and we assume any such trip has been organised through contacts he developed during that time.bIt added: We strongly condemn the continuous atrocities committed by the Assad regime and its Russian backers against civilians in Syria. We have called for urgent humanitarian access to besieged areas and have urged the government to establish a no-fly zone. It is understood that UK delegates are paying their own airfare. Several have already flown to Beirut, where they were picked up by Syrian government vehicles. From there they were driven across the Lebanese border to Damascus. It is unclear if the regime is paying for their hotels and food. Speakers from the Syrian regime include Bouthaina Shaaban, one of Assad’s key political advisers; Dr Ali Haidar, Syria’s minister for state reconciliation; and Fares Shehabi, an official from Aleppo. His presentation is called: Why did reconciliation not work in Aleppo until now? On Friday Syrian rebel groups said they had launched a large-scale offensive designed to break the government’s siege of eastern Aleppo. They fired rockets at a military airport and detonated car bombs. At least 15 people were killed in the rebel bombardment, and 100 injured. Syria’s state TV is expected to cover Sunday and Monday’s conference exhaustively. You can guess the regime media will be all over it, Doyle said. President Bashar al-Assad and his wife, Asma President Bashar al-Assad and his wife, Asma. Photograph: Fotonoticias/WireImage Akhras, Assad’s London-based father-in law, is not speaking but is the driving force behind the workshop, it is understood. A Harley Street cardiologist, he once enjoyed cross-party connections at the top of British politics. In 2010 he and his wife, Sahar Otri, attended a banquet thrown by the Queen in honour of the Emir of Qatar. Since the war began Akhras has kept a low profile, refusing to talk to journalists. He is believed to divide his time between the UK and Damascus. Akhras was born in Homs, Syria’s third-largest city. He emigrated to London in 1973 where he met his wife, an official at the Syrian embassy. Their daughter Asma was born in 1975. They raised her in Acton, where she grew up known as Emma, attending a local school and then Queen’s College, a private girls’ school on Harley Street. Akhras was the founding director of the British Syrian Society. He got the backing of a number of British establishment figures, including the former Liberal leader David Steel and Sir Andrew Green, the former British ambassador to Syria. The society flew MPs to Syria and arranged business conferences. In 2008, Akhras was invited to a Tory gala dinner and he became an unofficial conduit for journalists seeking interviews with the government."}

The emergency meeting was called by OIC sitting chair Saudi Arabia over security concerns following a missile launch intercepted by Riyadh in October, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir revealed. There was a request from Saudi Arabia [to the OIC] to convene the emergency meeting. The first order of business has to do with a recent missile launched against Saudi Arabia, he said in Jakarta on Tuesday. Any OIC member state has the right to call an emergency meeting as necessary, provided it reaches a quorum, Arrmanatha said. A Saudi-led coalition intervening in Yemen’s civil war accused the insurgent Houthi militia of launching a ballistic missile toward Mecca late last month, an allegation that the Houthis and their ally Iran vehemently denied. Yemen’s Houthis confirmed the launch, but said it had been aimed at an international airport in Jeddah. The coalition forces destroyed the missile 65 kilometers from the holy city before it could do any damage, said a statement from Saudi state agency SPA, as quoted by Reuters. Arrmanatha refrained from making any statement politicizing the incident, saying only that the firing of a missile into another country constitutes a violation of sovereignty and indicates a state of regional instability. A statement from the OIC confirmed the emergency meeting would take place in Mecca, pursuant to the recommendation of the executive committee [...] held at the ministerial level in Jeddah on Nov. 5 to discuss the launch of a ballistic missile [...] by Houthi-Saleh militias. The ministerial meeting is also expected to discuss the succession of the OIC secretary-general position, which was left vacant after incumbent chief Iyad Madani resigned at the end of October. The succession mechanism is decided at the ministerial level, so the meeting will also likely discuss the possibility of a replacement, Arrmanatha said. He said OIC foreign ministers would discuss Madani’s case, as it was considered extraordinary due to his mid-term resignation. The ministers will consider whether his replacement will be from Saudi Arabia, whether someone will carry out the rest of Madani’s term or if it will be a new appointment altogether, the ministry spokesman said. Days before announcing his resignation, OIC’s Madani infuriated Egypt over a remark that mocked President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.bThe former Saudi Arabian minister mixed up Sisi’s name with that of Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi at a conference, while also poking fun at widely derided comments made by Sisi claiming his fridge only had water in it for a decade. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry lambasted Madani in response, calling into question the Saudi Arabian’s ability to lead the world’s largest pan-Islamic body, AFP reported. Madani apologized for the quip and subsequently tendered his resignation from the secretary-general position, citing health reasons.

While it has been long known that American telecommunications companies worked closely with the spy agency, newly disclosed N.S.A. documents show that the relationship with AT&T has been considered unique and especially productive. One document described it as highly collaborative, while another lauded the company’s extreme willingness to help. AT&T’s cooperation has involved a broad range of classified activities, according to the documents, which date from 2003 to 2013. AT&T has given the N.S.A. access, through several methods covered under different legal rules, to billions of emails as they have flowed across its domestic networks. It provided technical assistance in carrying out a secret court order permitting the wiretapping of all Internet communications at the United Nations headquarters, a customer of AT&T. The N.S.A.’s top-secret budget in 2013 for the AT&T partnership was more than twice that of the next-largest such program, according to the documents. The company installed surveillance equipment in at least 17 of its Internet hubs on American soil, far more than its similarly sized competitor, Verizon. And its engineers were the first to try out new surveillance technologies invented by the eavesdropping agency. One document reminds N.S.A. officials to be polite when visiting AT&T facilities, noting, This is a partnership, not a contractual relationship. The documents, provided by the former agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, were jointly reviewed by The New York Times and ProPublica. The N.S.A., AT&T and Verizon declined to discuss the findings from the files. We don’t comment on matters of national security, an AT&T spokesman said.It is not clear if the programs still operate in the same way today. Since the Snowden revelations set off a global debate over surveillance two years ago, some Silicon Valley technology companies have expressed anger at what they characterize as N.S.A. intrusions and have rolled out new encryption to thwart them. The telecommunications companies have been quieter, though Verizon unsuccessfully challenged a court order for bulk phone records in 2014. At the same time, the government has been fighting in court to keep the identities of its telecom partners hidden. In a recent case, a group of AT&T customers claimed that the N.S.A.’s tapping of the Internet violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches. This year, a federal judge dismissed key portions of the lawsuit after the Obama administration argued that public discussion of its telecom surveillance efforts would reveal state secrets, damaging national security. The N.S.A. documents do not identify AT&T or other companies by name. Instead, they refer to corporate partnerships run by the agency’s Special Source Operations division using code names. The division is responsible for more than 80 percent of the information the N.S.A. collects, one document states. Fairview is one of its oldest programs. It began in 1985, the year after antitrust regulators broke up the Ma Bell telephone monopoly and its long-distance division became AT&T Communications. An analysis of the Fairview documents by The Times and ProPublica reveals a constellation of evidence that points to AT&T as that program’s partner. Several former intelligence officials confirmed that finding. A Fairview fiber-optic cable, damaged in the 2011 earthquake in Japan, was repaired on the same date as a Japanese-American cable operated by AT&T. Fairview documents use technical jargon specific to AT&T. And in 2012, the Fairview program carried out the court order for surveillance on the Internet line, which AT&T provides, serving the United Nations headquarters. (N.S.A. spying on United Nations diplomats has previously been reported, but not the court order or AT&T’s involvement. In October 2013, the United States told the United Nations that it would not monitor its communications.) The documents also show that another program, code-named Stormbrew, has included Verizon and the former MCI, which Verizon purchased in 2006. One describes a Stormbrew cable landing that is identifiable as one that Verizon operates. Another names a contact person whose LinkedIn profile says he is a longtime Verizon employee with a top-secret clearance. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, AT&T and MCI were instrumental in the Bush administration’s warrantless wiretapping programs, according to a draft report by the N.S.A.’s inspector general. The report, disclosed by Mr. Snowden and previously published by The Guardian, does not identify the companies by name but describes their market share in numbers that correspond to those two businesses, according to Federal Communications Commission reports. AT&T began turning over emails and phone calls within days after the warrantless surveillance began in October 2001, the report indicated. By contrast, the other company did not start until February 2002, the draft report said. In September 2003, according to the previously undisclosed N.S.A. documents, AT&T was the first partner to turn on a new collection capability that the N.S.A. said amounted to a  ‘live’ presence on the global net. In one of its first months of operation, the Fairview program forwarded to the agency 400 billion Internet metadata records — which include who contacted whom and other details, but not what they said — and was forwarding more than one million emails a day to the keyword selection system at the agency’s headquarters in Fort Meade, Md. Stormbrew was still gearing up to use the new technology, which appeared to process foreign-to-foreign traffic separate from the post-9/11 program. In 2011, AT&T began handing over 1.1 billion domestic cellphone calling records a day to the N.S.A. after a push to get this flow operational prior to the 10th anniversary of 9/11, according to an internal agency newsletter. This revelation is striking because after Mr. Snowden disclosed the program of collecting the records of Americans’ phone calls, intelligence officials told reporters that, for technical reasons, it consisted mostly of landline phone records. That year, one slide presentation shows, the N.S.A. spent $188.9 million on the Fairview program, twice the amount spent on Stormbrew, its second-largest corporate program. After The Times disclosed the Bush administration’s warrantless wiretapping program in December 2005, plaintiffs began trying to sue AT&T and the N.S.A. In a 2006 lawsuit, a retired AT&T technician named Mark Klein claimed that three years earlier, he had seen a secret room in a company building in San Francisco where the N.S.A. had installed equipment. Mr. Klein claimed that AT&T was providing the N.S.A. with access to Internet traffic that AT&T transmits for other telecom companies. Such cooperative arrangements, known in the industry as peering, mean that communications from customers of other companies could end up on AT&T’s network. After Congress passed a 2008 law legalizing the Bush program and immunizing the telecom companies for their cooperation with it, that lawsuit was thrown out. But the newly disclosed documents show that AT&T has provided access to peering traffic from other companies’ networks. AT&T’s corporate relationships provide unique accesses to other telecoms and I.S.P.s, or Internet service providers, one 2013 N.S.A. document states. Because of the way the Internet works, intercepting a targeted person’s email requires copying pieces of many other people’s emails, too, and sifting through those pieces. Plaintiffs have been trying without success to get courts to address whether copying and sifting pieces of all those emails violates the Fourth Amendment. Many privacy advocates have suspected that AT&T was giving the N.S.A. a copy of all Internet data to sift for itself. But one 2012 presentation says the spy agency does not typically have direct access to telecoms’ hubs. Instead, the telecoms have done the sifting and forwarded messages the government believes it may legally collect. Corporate sites are often controlled by the partner, who filters the communications before sending to N.S.A., according to the presentation. This system sometimes leads to delays when the government sends new instructions, it added. The companies’ sorting of data has allowed the N.S.A. to bring different surveillance powers to bear. Targeting someone on American soil requires a court order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. When a foreigner abroad is communicating with an American, that law permits the government to target that foreigner without a warrant. When foreigners are messaging other foreigners, that law does not apply and the government can collect such emails in bulk without targeting anyone. AT&T’s provision of foreign-to-foreign traffic has been particularly important to the N.S.A. because large amounts of the world’s Internet communications travel across American cables. AT&T provided access to the contents of transiting email traffic for years before Verizon began doing so in March 2013, the documents show. They say AT&T gave the N.S.A. access to massive amounts of data, and by 2013 the program was processing 60 million foreign-to-foreign emails a day. Because domestic wiretapping laws do not cover foreign-to-foreign emails, the companies have provided them voluntarily, not in response to court orders, intelligence officials said. But it is not clear whether that remains the case after the post-Snowden upheavals. We do not voluntarily provide information to any investigating authorities other than if a person’s life is in danger and time is of the essence, Brad Burns, an AT&T spokesman, said. He declined to elaborate."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":102,"title":"","class":0,"body":"The Defense Department's primary IT organization is partnering with its advanced research arm in a partnership aimed at accelerating military technology into the future. The Defense Information Systems Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency recently agreed to a partnership that would fast-track deployment-ready cyber technologies from DARPA to troops and other DISA users. The memorandum of understanding focuses on cybersecurity and DARPA's information innovation office, or I2O, according to DISA CTO Dave Mihelcic. We've had an off-again, on-again relationship with DARPA over the past 20 years or so. And it's very much on again, and in particular we're looking at how to leverage cybersecurity from DARPA's programs, particularly I2O, Mihelcic said. What we're trying to do is assess their programs for mature pieces of technology that we can adopt into DISA programs as well as provide them with requirements to drive them in directions in the future. The strategic partnership is a balance because DISA needs commercial-off-the-shelf or open-source technologies that can be easily taken and applied to programs and capability gaps. However, DARPA often works with prototypical technologies, rather than solutions that are ready to go right out of the box, Mihelcic said. We really want finished, supported products, so our goal in working with DARPA is to help guide their technologies to be inserted in either commercial products or other open-source products so that we can then adopt them and pay for support, he said. I don't want to have to turn into a cyber software development shop – really what I want to be able to do is to buy or steal. And if you look at what we're doing with some of our mainstream cyber portfolio elements, you'll see something similar there. The partnership works by officials from the two agencies sitting down and matching needs, then generating agreements to evaluate technologies and methods for transitioning them to DISA or commercial products. That really is nirvana for me, Mihelcic said. It's so valuable that [the agencies' leaders are meeting] to ensure that they have a strategic partnership to help industry deliver the products that are a quantum leap more secure than products that we have today. I think [DISA Director LTG Alan Lynn's] vision on that is very similar to mine. He wants to basically have industry provided to the products that are much more secure than they are today that we can easily integrate in our DoD concepts of operations, as opposed to having do significant developments. DARPA declined to comment for this story."}

Where the media was keen to highlight the controversies surrounding Modi, he has managed to redefine the India-UK relationship for the new century. India hit the headlines a year ago after pro-business leader Narendra Modi won a landslide election victory. India is aiming to install 100GW of solar power by 2022. The flow of investments, presence of a large Indian Diaspora and its expertise in urban development and skill development make it a very valued partner for India. In a DW interview, Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific Chief Economist at the analytics firm IHS, talks about the significance of Modi’s visit, Singapore’s growing significance for India, and how the two countries are likely to benefit from the strategic partnership. The Conservatives are keen on imparting it a new momentum. There is a sense of great expectation from our government. Argentina, Australia, Canada, Turkey, India, Germany, France, Italy, United States of America (USA), United Kingdom, Brazil, Russia, South Africa, China, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and the European Union. But at the same time, we find that a few people are not affected by viral because of immunity and inherent strength to counter the virus, Modi said. While it may serve a few rhetorical goal, it is counterproductive to take such a myopic approach. In India, Government and the Central Bank, are taking steps to further strengthen the financial and banking sector. The visit comes at a time when India is emerging as one of the more robust economies within the developing world. He also said the Indian community events were planned in Singapore and Malaysia as well. The communique reflected India’s concern on adopting climate change. Quoting Frost & Sullivan’s pioneering research on the world’s top 100 countries for Growth, Innovation and Leadership, PM Modi noted the growth consulting firm’s number 1 ranking of India. He made an attempt to lay the legacy of Britain’s imperial past to rest when he suggested that the soil of London had given birth to India’s freedom struggle, referring to India’s numerous freedom fighters who studied in the UK. Talking about Modi’s program in Singapore, Wadhwa said the Prime Minister will deliver the prestigious Singapore Lecture soon after his arrival on the evening of November 23 from Malaysia. If one tablet can bring such a change, then why can’t humans do it. Just cribbing will not do, he said. Economic ties between the two nations have intensified since the signing of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement in 2005. Both sides seem to recognise the challenge."}

The memorandums of understanding were signed following talks between Modi and his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak in the Prime Minister’s Office complex at Putrajaya, the federal administrative complex south of Kuala Lumpur. Modi has often said that Malaysia is central to his government’s Act East policy that aims to drive the economic development of the landlocked northeastern states. India has had a strategic partnership with Malaysia since 2010. The MoU on cyber security between the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) and Cyber Security Malaysia will promote cooperation and exchange of information on cyber security incident management, cyber attacks, technological cooperation, prevalent policies and mutual response to cyber security incidents. The MoU between the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) and Malaysia’s Performance Management and Delivery Unit (PEMANDU) will promote cooperation in management, delivery and monitoring of government programmes to improve efficiency and develop tools to monitor performance. The MoU between India’s culture ministry and Malaysia’s culture and tourism ministry is aimed at strengthening cultural exchanges and cooperation through visits of delegations and troupes, art exhibitions and exchange visits by scholars and experts. Speaking at a joint media interaction with Najib, Modi described the agreement on cyber security as very important. He said: As our lives get more networked, this is emerging as one of the most serious concerns of our age. Modi said he and Najib believed bilateral trade and investment ties could be scaled up significantly by exploiting bilateral and India-ASEAN agreements. We look forward to an early conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, he added. He further said India wants enhanced Malaysian participation in the expansion and upgrading of infrastructure and the Make in India and Smart Cities projects. Najib described Modi as a man of action and said India wants to conclude an official agreement to build a convention centre in New Delhi. I am excited about the new possibilities that we can do together with India, he said. We also discussed defence cooperation as India has a very dynamic and strong defence industry. Both ministries will discuss on the possibilities of expanding our bilateral cooperation, which includes joint production. India’s trade with Malaysia was worth $14 billion in 2014. This included imports of $9.7 billion, mainly commodities, mineral fuels and animal and vegetable oils. Malaysia has invested more than $7 billion in India and completed projects worth $6 billion, particularly in the infrastructure and construction sectors. India’s investments in Malaysia are around $2.3 billion and Indian companies such as IRCON, Reliance, Kirloskar, Bajaj, TCS, Mahindra, L&T and Wipro have a presence in the country. Modi also sought the early conclusion of an agreement on mutual recognition of educational degrees and invited Malaysian students to study in India.

Offered to India first when then-Foreign Minister K Shanmugam became one of the first world leaders to meet newly-elected Mr Modi last year, it is the high point of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two-day official visit to Singapore meant to celebrate 50 years of diplomatic ties. India was the second nation to recognise Singapore upon independence in 1965.

Clad in grey, Mr Modi arrived to a light drizzle, which Indians consider a good augur. Mr Lee also hosted lunch for Mr Modi, shortly after they witnessed the signing of nine bilateral documents and the launch of commemorative stamps to mark the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations. A joint statement laid out a broad vision for the relationship's development, spanning defence to cultural and people to people exchanges. It also reaffirmed a shared commitment to maritime security and freedom of navigation, as well as safety of sea lanes in accordance with international law, such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The strategic partnership will see regular high-level meetings at the level of Defence Ministers, the continuation of joint military exercises across all three service arms and collaboration in defence technology and co-production of weapons.

The information was imparted to him by Jamshyd N. Godrej, a co-chair of the India-Israel Forum, which is convening this week in Israel. The forum, which was founded eight years ago under the auspices of Tel Aviv University, focuses on international economic and financial trends and their impact on the economies of the two countries. It convenes annually, alternating between Israel and India. Godrej told Rivlin that members of the forum would like to see an improvement in flights to India. There is a great need for better connectivity, he said. Rivlin promised that he would speak to the relevant government authorities, with a view to increasing the flights. Dedicated to the enhancement of political, economic and defense relations between Israel and India, the forum, which is supported by several charitable trusts, is made up of policy-makers, captains of industry, academics and diplomats. It is a joint endeavor of TAU and Aspen Institute India and the Confederation of Indian Industry. The forum has grown in strength over the past eight years, Godrej said, adding that discussions during its current meeting in Israel have centered on geopolitics and how to make progress in different areas of trade. Not counting the deep ties in defense technology and appliances, he said that diamonds still made up the bulk of the trade between the two countries. In addition to attending the joint meetings, Indian visitors also met with Israeli counterparts on issues that included energy, environment, water, agriculture, space exploration, financial services, media, automobiles, electricity, politics, diplomacy and cyber security. At their meeting with Rivlin, they commented that this past year had been one of visibility – which is very important to the relationship between the two countries – and a good time for harvesting opportunities. They also made the point that India is very keen to have Israeli products made in India. Rivlin replied that in the early days of the state, Dov Yosef, whose various cabinet portfolios included trade and industry, hammered home the importance of the Made in Israel trademark. One of the Indians responded: We call it ‘Make in India,’ not ‘Made in India.’ Two of the leading figures of Reliance Industries India said they were exploring opportunities that went beyond joint ventures with Israeli companies, including agreements with educational institutions for use of their research. The two said they believed that Israel could also be a partner in building India’s new infrastructure. Although India’s educational institutions are of a very high standard, Indian students would like to come to Israel to study, Rivlin was told. He was also told that despite the difference in populations, the number of start-ups in India was more or less equal to that in Israel. One of the problems in working together is that of cultural differences. Whereas Israelis are always in a hurry, Indians tend to take things slowly. Sometimes, walking a little slower means getting to the task faster, Rivlin said. Stanley Bergman, a New York-based co-chairman of the forum, spoke of the importance of collaboration and dialogue. He said there has been a lot of collaborative work in security and cyber technology, as well as a lot of discussion on getting incubator technologies from the university to the market. Rivlin pointed out that cyber research and development were no less important in civilian life than in the military. He cited banks as a prime example. Prof. Joseph Klafter, president of Tel Aviv University, noted that TAU had been a catalyst for relations between the two countries and was now building bridges beyond academia. He said he was very proud of the university’s role in the relationship. In welcoming the forum, Rivlin spoke of his forthcoming state visit to India at the invitation of President Pranab Mukherjee, who was in Israel two weeks ago. He will be accompanied by a large business delegation, and emphasized the need for the two countries to work together on issues such as food production, water conservation and innovation."}

Cameron and Netanyahu also talked about the threat of Islamist extremism and agreed that both political and economic security was required for long term peace, and pledged to continue to work together to support fragile countries in North Africa. Before the journey of Netanyahu to Britain, protesters gathered outside Downing Street on Wednesday to protest against his visit, according to local media reports. Media reported a petition for his arrest for alleged war crimes have received more than 100,000 signatures. In response to the petition, London government said under the British and international law, visiting heads of foreign governments, such as Prime Minister Netanyahu, have immunity from legal process, and cannot be arrested or detained."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":112,"title":"RI and Turkey to cooperate economically, share intelligence","class":0,"body":"Cooperating on economic and intelligence issues was the main focus of the commitment made by Indonesia and Turkey when both countries' leaders met on Friday. The commitment was made following a bilateral meeting between President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Merdeka Palace, Central Jakarta.Jokowi said he and Erdogan ' who arrived in Jakarta late Thursday for a three-day visit ' had discussed a number of issues, including economics and terrorism, in the bilateral meeting, that he called 'open, friendly and very productive'. 'We have discussed several issues, such as global issues related to terrorism and the situation in the Middle East. But we focused on the economic sector,' Jokowi said during a joint press conference. 'We have agreed to soon settle existing trade barriers. We have also agreed that it is now time for a joint commission, focusing on the economy, to meet sometime this year to explore existing potentials so that those that exist can be improved.'According to Jokowi, the two countries are also seeking to cooperate in the military equipment industry, small vessels manufacturing industry and power plant industry. According to the Foreign Ministry, Turkey was Indonesia's 7th biggest trade partner in the European region with two-way trade reaching US$2.47 billion in 2014. Natural rubber, polyester synthetic fiber, palm oil and textiles are among Indonesia's main commodities exports to Turkey. Turkey's investment in Indonesia reached $64.1 million with 29 projects last year. Jokowi thought the two countries shared many similarities and were internationally intertwined in platforms such as MIKTA (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Australia), the G20 and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). 'The two countries also play their own strategic roles in their respective regions,' he added. Erdogan, who brought along a delegation of more than 200 businesspeople, said his visit aimed to strengthen trade and economic ties with Indonesia 'on the basis of mutual benefits for both countries'. 'We will hold a business forum [the Turkey-Indonesia Business Forum] tomorrow [Saturday]. I hope the forum will be the place where we can produce new projects,' he said. In terms of intelligence cooperation, both countries discussed joint efforts in the fight against terrorism and the prevention of radicalism. In his remarks, Erdogan warned that terrorist groups from the Middle East could influence other regions. Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi said the two countries, however, did not specifically discuss the 16 Indonesian citizens, who had been reported missing in Turkey and allegedly joined the Islamic State (IS) movement. 'The point is that we [the two countries] agreed to enhance intelligence cooperation,' she said. In a public lecture at the National Resilience Institute (Lemhanas) earlier on Friday, Erdogan called on Indonesia and Turkey to fight against terrorism together as they had the same vision of eliminating the threat of extremism. One of the challenges is that some countries have shown their reluctance in sharing information about terrorism. 'Turkey is eager and sincere to establish this kind of relationship and we are happy to see that Indonesia shares the same values as we do. A strong political, social and economic relationship between Turkey and Indonesia will be beneficial for not only their people, but also for the whole world,' Erdogan said. He added that in order to resolve the most urgent conflicts in the Middle East, such as those in Syria and Iraq, any solution would have to adjust to a certain country's historical, political and cultural sensitivities as well as its social structure. 'Tolerance must be the practiced solution in resolving conflicts in Islamic countries because Islam does not advocate terrorism [...].' Erdogan and his delegation then performed Friday prayers at the Istiqlal Grand Mosque where he was accompanied by Vice President Jusuf Kalla."}

At NATO’s annual cyber conference early this week, Microsoft announced the signing of an agreement with the NATO Communications and Information Agency that aims to improve cyber security in the EU. We see this signing as another step forward in the NATO -Industry Cyber Partnership, building a stronger cyber defense network today with Microsoft, but also with other Industry partners across the world explained the Ambassador Sorin Ducaru, Assistant Secretary General of NATO’s Emerging Security Challenges Division. The Government Security Program was promoted by Microsoft to help governments in protecting their assets and maintain a proper security posture to mitigate cyber threats. The initiative is not a novelty for Microsoft that already support more than 40 agencies from more than 25 governments worldwide. The IT giants will provide online training tools and guidance on threat actors and related TTPs. Under the Government Security Program, Microsoft and NATO will mutually share technical information on cyber threats, Microsoft will offer to the NATO Communications and Information Agency access to technical information and documentation on Microsoft products and services, and threat intelligence. The program has the goal of offering transparency and reliability in the fight against cybercrime and in the mitigation of cyber threats. we have found that supporting an open dialogue and collaborative environment is the most effective way to increase transparency, reliability and integrity in our collective desire for improving cybersecurity. Microsoft explained. NATO is facing new and increasingly dangerous threats to cybersecurity across the world and these threats could affect national economies and citizens. To avoid it, NCI Agency strongly believes in rapid and early information sharing on threats and vulnerabilities with leading companies worldwide, such as Microsoft.

{"id":114,"title":"Russia And China Have A Cyber Nonaggression Pact","class":0,"body":"The two powers are advancing a vision of security in cyberspace that is markedly different from Western approaches. On May 8, the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China signed a bilateral agreement on cooperation in the field of international information security. The treaty, which some have dubbed a nonaggression pact for cyberspace, details cooperative measures both governments pledge to undertake, including exchange of information and increased scientific and academic cooperation. With this, Russia and China continue to advance their vision of information security, a view of security concerns in cyberspace that is markedly different from Western approaches of cybersecurity. Many observers have characterized the agreement as a largely political move at a time of heightened tensions with the United States and Europe. The alignment of Russia and China is seen as a response to growing Western pressure. Accordingly, Russia’s pivot to the East follows Western sanctions over its actions in Ukraine. However, a closer look reveals that the agreement follows a longstanding series of diplomatic initiatives launched by both countries. Already in 2009 Russia and China signed an agreement on cooperation in the field of international information security in the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Later, in 2011 both countries submitted a proposal for an international code of conduct for information security to the United Nations. Although the proposal failed to garner sufficient support in the relevant Committee of the General Assembly, Russia and China redoubled their efforts. An updated version of the code of conduct is currently circulating in the UN in time for this fall’s General Assembly session. All these initiatives sought to advance Russia’s and China’s views on a variety of cybersecurity issues while shoring up their positions in international discussions. This year’s bilateral agreement is no exception in this regard. The treaty picks up on many of the themes from past documents. For one, the Russian-Chinese agreement continues to define threats in cyberspace broadly. While the treaty mentions threats that would also be of concern to the United States and Europe, the pact also defines cyber threats as the transmission of information that could endanger the societal-political and social-economic systems, and spiritual, moral and cultural environment of states. Obviously, this could be interpreted very broadly and Western countries have been concerned that similar provisions could be used to unduly restrict the free flow of information. Second, the agreement between Russia and China also touches upon questions of Internet governance. Continuing previous efforts, the document calls for the creation of a multilateral, democratic and transparent management system for the Internet, giving states and their governments a greater, if not predominant, voice in the governance process. This view of multilateral Internet governance stands in contrast to the multi-stakeholder model preferred by Western states. The treaty is most interesting for its novel aspects. Compared with past initiatives, the agreement details a remarkable level of cooperation. Whereas previous pledges of cooperation remained vague and somewhat aspirational, the current agreement provides a list of concrete measures and policies to be realized by both sides, coordinated and evaluated through two consultation meetings a year. These range from the creation of contact points and communication channels between various government entities to the realization of joint scientific projects. Moreover, the agreement stands out for its normative aspects. It specifically provides that both countries shall cooperate in the creation and dissemination of international legal norms in cyberspace. This includes increased cooperation and coordination of positions in various international forums, including the UN, where both countries have been pushing for the negotiation of new international legal norms to regulate the use of cyber warfare.  The agreement thus formalizes their joint interest in shaping the international debate on norms in cyberspace. Lastly, one provision has been widely reported as a nonaggression provision whereby Russia and China, for the first time, pledge to refrain from computer attacks against each other. In Article 4 the treaty provides that: Each Party has an equal right to the protection of the information resources of their state against misuse and unsanctioned interference, including computer attacks against them. Each Party shall not exercise such actions with respect to the other Party and shall assist the other Party in the realization of said right. The two sentences, in conjunction, could be read in a way to keep Russia and China from using computer attacks against each other. If so, this provision would be remarkable not only for its content but also for the kind of language it employs. Previously, particularly China has avoided the usage of language that could implicate the right to self-defense, which it interprets as legitimizing the use of offensive cyber activity in conflict. On the other hand, the language of this provision is strikingly vague. Phrases such as misuse and unsanctioned interference could obviously be interpreted quite differently by both sides leaving significant loopholes in the scope of the provision. Given the magnitude of Russian and Chinese activities in cyberspace, including those directed against each other, this commitment and the seriousness with which it will be implemented are questionable. Thus, the characterization of this provision as a nonaggression pledge might be overstated. Overall, the Russian and Chinese agreement continues many familiar themes. It echoes previous diplomatic initiatives that have united both countries in international cybersecurity discussions. Yet, it also offers a number of novel aspects. In the end, however, the treaty itself is just the first step. The decisive aspect in evaluating the impact of this document will be its implementation. Particularly the implementation (or non-implementation) of the cooperation commitments, and even more so of the nonaggression provision, will decide whether the agreement really marks the beginning of a closer relationship between both countries or whether it will be relegated to a symbolic diplomatic effort overtaken by reality."}

Xi was welcomed by President Hassan Rouhanimeet in Sa'dabad palace in northern Tehran. The Chinese president will meet Iran's most powerful figure, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, later in the day. China is seeking to improve bilateral ties with Iran to start a new season of comprehensive, long-term and sustainable relations with the Islamic Republic, President Xi was quoted as saying by Iran's state news agency, IRNA, on his arrival in Tehran on Friday night. Some 16 accords, including a strategic cooperation agreement, will be signed during the Chinese President's Iran visit, Deputy Foreign Minister Ebrahim Rahimpour said, according to state television. Trade between Iran and China stood at around $52 billion in 2014, Rahimpour said, but falling oil prices caused it to drop last year. The Chinese president is the first leader to visit Iran since international sanctions were lifted on Jan 16, after Iran reached an agreement with six major powers to limit its nuclear program. China was one of the six. Xi is also the first Chinese president to visit Iran in 14 years, according to the Iranian state news agency, IRNA. He has visited Saudi Arabia and Egypt as well during his Middle East tour, which started on Jan. 19. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, Xi's first stop, has been at odds with Shi'ite Iran since Saudi authorities executed a Shi'ite cleric, Nimr al-Nimr, on Jan. 2.

{"id":118,"title":"Iran Expects More Cooperation with China: Officials","class":0,"body":"Chinese President Xi Jinping is to visit Iran over the weekend, the final leg of his Middle East tour. As CRI's Fei Fei reports, Iranian officials have expressed their expectations for more bilateral cooperation with China on the occasion of the visit. Iran's Vice President and chairman of Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization, Masoud Soltanifar, said Iran expects to deepen cooperation with China in the areas of tourism and culture. He hoped that more Chinese visitors can come to Iran to enjoy the country's profound cultural heritage. We think that the number of Chinese who travel to Iran should be higher than it is now, which is currently lower than 50,000. We believe that about ten to 20 percent of foreign tourists will come from China in the next ten years, which means that we will receive one million or two million Chinese tourists. Soltanifar said Iran is already trying to attract more visitors by simplifying visa application procedures and improving tourism facilities to cater to Chinese visitors. For example, more Chinese restaurants, more travel guides who can speak Chinese, and more necessary facilities in accordance with the demands of Chinese tourists. Iran's Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Ali Tayyebnia pointed out that Xi Jinping's visit to Iran will provide important opportunities to develop cooperation in the fields of politics and trade. China is much more than a common trade partner to Iran. We consider China as a strategic partner and hope to keep our long-term friendship with China, without the interruption of any short-term political and economic factors. We believe that President Xi's visit to Iran sends a signal that China is willing to develop long-term strategic ties with Iran. The minister also expressed his expectations that Iran will become more heavily involved in China's Belt and Road initiative, the modern day land and maritime Silk Roads. China's 'Belt and Road' initiative has attracted wide attention from people from all walks of life in Iran. Iran has a great capability and potential and we believe that this initiative will bring benefit to all the countries along the road. Therefore, we have expressed our interest in participating in this project. Meanwhile, some departments of Iran have put forward some plans and I hope Iran and Iranian enterprises can play an important in part in the 'Belt and Road' initiative. Chinese President Xi Jinping is currently on a 4-day state tour of the Middle East and Soltanifar believes key agreements can be reached when Xi concludes his visit in Iran. It's expected that the two countries can come to a consensus during President Xi's visit and sign the related agreements. As I said before, China provided us much assistance during the difficult period of sanctions and helped us solve many problems. We will never forget our old friend after the lifting of the nuclear sanctions. Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the proposal of jointly building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road in 2013. As part of the initiative, China committed 40 billion dollars to the establishment of a Silk Road Fund in 2014 to support relevant cooperation projects in countries along the Belt and Road. Ahead of his state visit to the country, President Xi Jinping published a signed article titled Work Together for a Bright Future of China-Iran Relations on Iranian newspaper Iran on Thursday. In the article, President Xi says China is ready to deepen cooperation with Iran on building roads, railway, sea routes and the Internet, and facilitating East-West connectivity in Asia.

Was it due to hacking? A United Airlines official said there was no indication that this was caused by an outside entity, but it wasn’t the first time United – or flights by other airlines – were grounded for unexplained reasons. That airlines are vulnerable to hackers is well-established. In June, for example, planes were grounded in Poland after hackers breached the network at Warsaw’s Chopin airport, causing delays that affected some 1,400 passengers. In May, United removed a passenger from a flight after he apparently hacked into a plane’s navigation system via its entertainment system.

In May, United announced a Bug Bounty contest, inviting hackers to test its online systems to find weaknesses. Last week, the airline awarded a million frequent flier miles to two hackers were able to find vulnerabilities. While he couldn’t share the specifics of the hack (to prevent details of the vulnerabilities from coming out), Jordan Wiens, one of the winners, said that the bugs were somewhat lame – an indication that the system may not have been very well-protected.

We enjoy a strong, historic relationship, based on common values and support for democracy, the rule of law, human rights and open markets. I am pleased that last summer the Japanese parliament passed legislation allowing Japan to play a greater role in international peace and security. In November 2015, the UK published its Strategic Defence and Security Review, which describes Japan as our closest security partner in Asia. In 2016 we look forward to working closely with Japan as it takes up a seat on the UN Security Council and chairs the G7 summit. The long-term security of both the UK and Japan depend on upholding a stable international system. We will continue to work closely together to contribute to global prosperity, peace and security. The world today is increasingly dangerous, complex and uncertain. We face growing threats from terrorism and extremism, a resurgence in state-based threats including nuclear proliferation, and an escalation in challenges to our cyber security and to the rules-based international order. It is more important than ever for the UK to work with allies like Japan to counter these threats. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the UK is continuing to play a central role on the issues that matter and is working with allies like Japan to safeguard national security, as well as building our prosperity overseas.

{"id":123,"title":" US to increase intel sharing with France","class":0,"body":" WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration announced Monday a new intelligence-sharing arrangement with France designed to more readily and quickly allow joint military planning in the campaign against the Islamic State. After President Barack Obama announced the arrangement to reporters in Turkey, the Pentagon issued a statement saying that Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have authorized military personnel to share information quickly with their French counterparts. Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said the action was taken in light of the terror attacks in Paris. French warplanes bombed Islamic State targets in Syria Sunday in close cooperation with the U.S. military. Cook did not provide details about the kinds of intelligence that would be shared but said the new instructions build on efforts made over the past year to work more closely with French military, intelligence and security services to target the Islamic State. Current and former American intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said Washington already maintains extremely close counter terrorism cooperation with Paris. The new sharing mainly involves military intelligence in Syria and Iraq, they said. Bureaucratic hurdles slow the exchange of such information, even among allies. The new arrangement would allow the U.S. to share intelligence with France that previously has been limited to what's known as the Five Eyes of English-speaking countries - the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The intelligence would allow France to increase its ability to identify and propose targets to be hit by airstrikes, officials say. France is not a member of the Five Eyes and will not become one, officials say. Those countries maintain near-universal sharing of electronic eavesdropping and other intelligence, and tend not to spy on one another. Close allies though they may be, France and the U.S. have a history of spying on one another. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden disclosed American eavesdropping on French officials, and the French for years have carried out economic spying against the U.S., American officials have said. Large segments of the French public also were disturbed by Snowden revelations of French cooperation with American mass surveillance, which complicated the intelligence relationship. Just because information is shared does not mean it is always acted upon. A senior Turkish official, for example, tells The Associated Press that his country shared information last year and in June about Omar Ismail Mostefai, who has been named as one of the Paris attackers. Mostefai entered Turkey in 2013, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Turkey never heard back from France, the official said."}

He said India has reduced inflation and current account and fiscal deficits and its programmes of inclusive development, financial inclusion, universal access to basic needs, Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Industrial Corridors and Smart Cities will boost growth and employment in the country. Remittances are a key source of income for households and support for economies in developing countries. In a statement the government said that strengthening the security partnerships of the two countries with an exchange of counter-terrorism best practices, technologies and cyber-security knowledge were also topics of discussion between the two leaders. Cameron stated at a press conference that he wants the UK to be India’s number one partner to support the finance of Indian infrastructure improvements that Modi plans. The UK and India will elevate their Defence relationship by establishing capability partnerships in strategic areas, through which we will work together across the spectrum of doctrine, training and other elements upon which military effectiveness depends. These partnerships will enable transfer of strategic capability between our two nations, including defence technologies and manufacturing in areas of mutual interest."}

The comments from State Councilor Yang Jiechi were published in the English-language China Daily after U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a congressional committee on Thursday the United States must beef up security against Chinese hackers. Yang's comments were not a direct reaction. China and the United States actually can make cyber security a point of cooperation between our two countries, Yang said in an interview focused on Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming state visit to America. We hope China, the United States and other countries could work together to work out the rules for cyber security in the international arena in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, said Yang, who outranks the foreign minister. The Obama administration is considering targeted sanctions against Chinese individuals and companies for cyber attacks against U.S. commercial targets, several U.S. officials have said. Chinese hackers have also been implicated in the massive hacking of the U.S. government's personnel office disclosed this year. Clapper's testimony added to pressure on Beijing over its conduct in cyberspace just weeks before Xi's visit. Yang noted, as Chinese officials regularly do, that China was itself a hacking victim and said suspected cases of hacking should be investigated and handled on a solid, factual basis. On another point of rising friction between the United States and China - the territorial disputes in the South China Sea - Yang said he hoped the United States would stay on the sidelines because it was not part of the disputes. He added, though: It is important for both countries to stay in close touch even if they have different perceptions and views."}

On Sunday, the UK Trade and Investment’s Defence and Security Organisation – an arm of the British government – brought companies to Intersec, the three-day security, safety and fire protection expo in Dubai in the hope of landing lucrative contracts in cybersecurity, infrastructure and transport. There is talk about establishing a large rail network in the UAE [between Abu Dhabi and Dubai] which, security-wise, will always require cybersecurity, said Simon Everest, a senior adviser at the organisation. There are big opportunities [for British businesses] in the Gulf, and this week will be a key time for these companies. Two years ago, the UK announced that it would be prepared to help the UAE prepare its security for Expo 2020, including police training and surveillance equipment. The growth rates in security over the next four years range from 11 to 15 per cent, he said. We have a large team based in the UAE and we work together on a number of large infrastructure projects such as rail and aviation. From the 2012 London Olympics to the Commonwealth Games staged in three of its cities in the past 30 years, the UK has an extensive amount of knowledge in the field. We provide training across the Middle East and consultancy in terms of planning major events, said Richard Freeman, a police and security adviser at the organisation. We see this amount of security knowledge and understanding we can share to make Dubai Expo 2020 a safe event. One of the products includes a powerful loudspeaker which would send a message to large crowds of people with a range of up to 250 metres. There is a strong interest from Dubai police, said Glyn Buckler, director at Cerberus Black. It’s a brand new product to the market and it is an acoustic communications and warning system. Another product is a hardware security system for prisoners. We provide the control system to the Metropolitan Police who will provide more than 1,000 systems to the Emirates’ police department, said Peter Jarvis, senior executive vice president at Storm Interface. The system is used when criminals are arrested and have to be brought in to a secure room."}

{"id":132,"title":" EU and Brazil to work together on 5G mobile technology","class":0,"body":" The EU and Brazil today signed an agreement to develop 5G, the next generation of communication networks. The Commission also started work on an action plan to deploy the technology in the EU by 2020. In the future, everybody and everything will use 5G. By 2020, there will be 26 billion connected devices and 70 percent of people will own a smartphone. 5G will be the backbone of the EU Digital Single Market, industries of the future, modern public services and innovative applications such as connected cars, smart homes or mobile health services. To face this global challenge, the EU joins forces with Brazil to strengthen cooperation in this strategic area and to make sure that 5G does not develop in silos at the international level. The EU and Brazil, which are close trading partners, have been cooperating on information and communication technologies since 2008. European Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society Günther H. Oettinger and Brazilian Minister of Communications André Figueiredo today signed a joint declaration at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona. This agreement follows similar key cooperation initiatives with South Korea, Japan and China. Vice-President Ansip, responsible for the Digital Single Market said: I congratulate colleagues for this important new step in pushing for 5G at global level. This is about essential technology to ensure connectivity. But it is also about building trust and confidence in online services and creating the right conditions for the technology to be deployed across borders. Spectrum coordination is essential to make 5G happen. (See also his keynote speech given at the MWC yesterday) Günther H. Oettinger, in charge of the Digital Economy and Society, said: After landmark agreements with China, Japan and South Korea, today's cooperation initiative with Brazil is a new key step towards 5G. Neither Europe, nor Brazil can afford to lag behind in the digital era. With today's agreement we have notably committed to cooperating on the take-up of 5G in so-called vertical industries such as transport or energy. International agreements are complementary to our efforts to deploy the technology in the EU and the work we are starting today to prepare a 5G action plan for the EU. (See also his keynote speech given this morning). The EU and Brazil have committed to developing a global definition of 5G and to identifying the services (for example connected cars, the Internet of Things or very high-definition video streaming) which should be the first delivered by 5G networks. The two partners will also work to define common standards in order to have a stronger position on the global stage. They will cooperate in identifying the most promising radio frequencies to meet the additional spectrum requirements for 5G, especially in the framework of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition, they will promote the deployment of 5G in fields like smart cities, agro-food, education, health, transport or energy as well as possibilities for joint research projects in this area. Cooperation agreements are also being discussed with India and the United States. 5G will be a game changer not only for telecom companies but also for a number of key industries. This is why it is essential to connect these actors and help build the future market of 5G products and services. Today in Barcelona, Commissioner Oettinger called on sectors like logistics, transport, energy, health and digital manufacturing to work together with the Commission on a 5G action plan. It is important to think together on the measures, timetable and investment incentives needed to rollout essential 5G infrastructure in the EU. The aim is to build on EU investments already planned in 5G research and innovation - €700 million by 2020 - so that European companies are ready to start offering 5G products and services in 2020 (blog post by Commissioner Oettinger). The Commission has recently made an important step to pave the way for 5G in the EU. Earlier this month, the Commission presented a proposal to coordinate the use of the 700 MHz band for mobile services (press release). Mobile operators using the 700 MHz band will be able to offer higher-speed and higher-quality broadband (i.e. without service interruption) to consumers and cover wider areas, including rural and remote regions. It will enable Europe to move ahead and provide mobile broadband speeds beyond 100 Mb/s and catch up with leading regions in 4G mobile broadband take-up (like South Korea or the USA). As soon as specific 5G standards and associated technology and equipment are available by 2020, mobile operators will be in a good position to roll out 5G services. Further steps to coordinate spectrum in the EU will be part of the forthcoming review of EU telecoms rules foreseen for autumn 2016. The Commission has been cooperating with Brazil on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) since 2008. An EU-Brazil joint call inthe ICT work programme 2016-2017 under the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme will set up joint projects on 5G and also facilitate policy coordination in related areas between the EU and Brazil. In December 2013, the Commission launched a Public-Private Partnership on 5G (press release - factsheet). The EU is investing €700 million by 2020 in this partnership under Horizon 2020. EU industry is set to match this investment by up to 5 times, to more than €3 billion euros."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":133,"title":" Law enforcement agencies work together to locate, arrest suspected killer","class":0,"body":" KALAMAZOO, Mich. (NEWSCHANNEL 3) - We're learning more about the moments before suspected Kalamazoo shooter Jason Dalton was arrested near a Kalamazoo bar. A Kalamazoo County deputy followed Dalton, and later, a city officer made the arrest. Law enforcement personnel say all this peaceful resolution following such violence wouldn't have been possible without teamwork. If you talk to any officer involved, no one will take credit for the suspect's arrest. They say Sunday morning was a situation that relied on communication and teamwork from start to finish. I walked away with the understanding that while we all realize this can happen in any community, I recognize that not every community is ready to react as my team, this team in Kalamazoo community, I mean all those agencies I mentioned before, I am just a team member, Sheriff Richard Fuller said. City, county, state, and countless others, working together during the worst. Work that relationship like you are brother and sister, you are side by side working as a team, Fuller said. Three scenes. Eight victims. Six dead. One accused shooter on the loose. We had deputies hearing what happened, and they were showing up at the police station on their own, they showed up, and they were jumping in their cars, and going out looking for this guy, said Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas. We had that time where everyone came together to find this guy. All involved were professional, but the motive was deeply personal. Sometimes it get gets forgotten we are just men and women in the community when we take the uniform off; it's important for the public to realize how invested we are, and how we want to see good, said Michigan State Police Lieutenant Dale Hinz, the Paw Paw post commander. The suspected gunman, Jason Dalton, pulled over just hours after police say he shot his first victim. Something that all agree would have been impossible without communication. To have that teamwork to the degree that we did on Saturday night is a true testament to the professionalism and dedication, Hinz said. We're told these agencies have been working together and responding to incidents large and small--something they say helped them all on Saturday night."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":134,"title":" Hongkongers must work together to resolve problems: Tsang","class":0,"body":" Financial Secretary John Tsang called on people to set aside political differences and work together with patience and perseverance to the resolve the problems facing Hong Kong. For the problems of Hong Kong, they cannot be solved by anyone else except ourselves, Tsang said in his budget speech at the Legislative Council. As long as everyone is willing to set aside short-term political considerations in favor of the long-term overall interests of Hong Kong, we shall have a chance to return to rationality, he said on Wednesday, two weeks after violent clashes in Mong Kok between protestors and the police. Our problems are man-made, therefore they can be solved by men, Tsang said. After the unlawful Occupy movement in 2014 and the defeat of the constitutional reform package last year, confrontations have not eased, and worse still, our society has become even more polarized, Tsang said. I am deeply troubled by the current situation… If we should allow the situation to get worse, what lies in store for Hong Kong will be even greater chaos, and our future generations will grow up in the midst of hatred and malice. Tsang said he believes Hong Kong people have both the ability and the wisdom to cope with the current problems, given that the city has battled its way successfully through wars, poverty, epidemics, economic recessions and financial crises in the world.Looking back on the road that we have traveled, I believe I also believe that one day we can break the deadlock. When the storms are over, we shall cherish all the more the harmonious and cohesive society that we have restored. The finance chief said he was impressed with Hong Kong football team’s match against Qatar last year. We lost the match, but the never-say-die spirit that they exhibited won the hearts of our city. To Hong Kong, this match has taken on significance beyond victory and defeat. It has led me to believe that, with our love for Hong Kong, we are able to overcome any challenge ahead of us, no matter how difficult it is. In the introduction to the budget speech, Tsang said he, along with many Hong Kong people, feels distressed and angry about the recent large-scale riot in Mong Kok. I was perplexed as to why violence had flared in Hong Kong. I was shocked that our city could have turned overnight into such a strange and alien place that I hardly recognized. I was troubled why the core values that we long cherished had been devoured by violence and hatred. He said he anticipates that political disputes will only intensify over the coming months due to the Legislative Council elections in September. Acute social conflicts will add uncertainties to the already adverse economic environment… Politics and economics are closely intertwined. Political volatility will unavoidably impact on our economy, Tsang said. In other remarks, the financial secretary criticized the so-called localists for staging protests against mainland tourists last year. He said a handful of people chose to express their views and political demands using irrational and uncivilized tactics, such as hurling abuse at visitors and kicking their suitcases. These destructive acts have not only damaged the economy, but have also severely tarnished Hong Kong’s reputation as a hospitality city internationally, Tsang said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":135,"title":" US and Russia Work Together to Enforce Syrian Ceasefire","class":0,"body":" The Syrian Civil War has left hundreds of thousands dead and displaced millions of people from their homes. It has bred controversies in countries where the war’s refugees are asking to be let in, a ripple effect that's been called the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II. The war began in March 2011 when peaceful protests against the government turned into violent – so far, there's no end in sight. As one Atlantic article explains it, the war is partly one of government against people, partly a religious war … and increasingly a proxy war featuring Russia and Iran against the United States and its allies. Russian President Vladimir Putin has interest in keeping Syrian President Bashar Assad in power. The United States and President Barack Obama are calling for Assad’s removal. But yesterday – at least on paper – the U.S. and Russia reached a draft agreement on the cessation of hostilities between the Syrian government and opposition groups. The two countries have agreed to act as monitors of the truce. The ceasefire is slated to start at midnight on Feb. 27, Damascus time. The truce will come into effect only if key players – the Syrian government, opposition forces supported by Saudi Arabia and the Syrian Kurds – acquiesce by noon Feb. 26. The agreement doesn’t include ISIS, the al-Nursa Front and other terrorist organizations. Michael Mosser, assistant director of the Center for European Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, says this could mean the beginning of Washington and Moscow reaching an agreement on what role Assad should play in the conflict. Mosser says the Obama administration wants Assad gone, especially if any political solution for Syria is going to be effective. But there’s this enormous roadblock: Assad is not willing to walk away from the war. That could change, Mosser says. What I’ve been sort of following and reading in my own analysis is that Russia is putting considerable pressure on Assad to begin the process of thinking about leaving, Mosser says. I think Russia sees an endgame here that may in fact occur with Assad out. The big tricky question, Mosser says, is who will fill the political vacuum once Assad is no longer in power. There are some pretty intense negotiations going on … in both capitals, as to who might take Assad’s place, he says. The United States is playing the long game, Mosser says. They’re thinking about not just Syria, but Libya and terrorist organizations acting there. Syria is really just one theater in a much bigger area of operation, Mosser says. Despite what sounds like an end to the conflict, Mosser says we’re nowhere close to a political solution yet. A cessation of hostilities is a necessary first step for sure, he says. But a political solution is unlikely in this calendar year and possibly not even for the next one."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":136,"title":" U.S., Cameroon work together to counter illicit trafficking, improve maritime safety","class":0,"body":" LIMBE, Cameroon – U.S. Marines and sailors are working with Cameroon’s Fusiliers Marins (FUMA) and Compagnie des Palmeurs de Combat (COPALCO) to increase their capabilities to combat illicit activity and increase security in the waterways and borders of Cameroon. At the request of the Cameroonian government and through coordination with the U.S. Embassy in Yaounde, Marines and sailors with Special-Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response-Africa, are partnering with their military counterparts in infantry tactics in support of their maritime security force capabilities. The small team of Marines are currently attached to Africa Partnership Station, which is an international security cooperation initiative sponsored by U.S. Africa Command and facilitated by U.S. Naval Forces Africa (NAVAF), aimed at strengthening global maritime partnerships through training and other collaborative activities in order to improve maritime security and safety in Africa. The Marines and sailors are conducting training in combat marksmanship, patrolling, ambush techniques, close-quarters combat, tactical questioning and operations orders. First Lt. Ryan T. Murray, the SPMAGTF-CR-AF APS team officer in charge, said the ultimate goal is to assist the units to defend Cameroon’s border against everything from illicit activities, such as countering violent extremist organizations such as Boko Haram, which has kidnapped scores of children, mostly girls, and then using them as suicide bombers to target military and innocent civilians, in the country’s northeastern Borno State. Murray added, during the month-long mission, the Marines will train FUMA and COPALCO to work together, so they can seize an objective during the final exercise, adding some of the troops present for the training have real-world experience to add to the training evolution. The Fusilier Marins are basically out of their recruit training, so some of this is new to them, said Murray. But, they are a solid group of men who are working well together. The ultimate goal for FUMA and COPALCO is to ensure they are combat ready and ready to demonstrate their ability to utilize small-unit infantry tactics in a kinetic environment. In a press release from the U.S. Embassy in Yaounde, Cameroon, last year, U.S. Ambassador Michael S. Hoza stated the U.S. government is committed to stand with and support Cameroon as their forces counter illicit trafficking and Boko Haram so that all citizens can build a future of peace and prosperity for all Cameroonians through their talents, contributions, efforts, and ideas. The Ambassador also stated Army Gen. David M. Rodriguez, commander for U.S. Africa Command, visited Cameroon to reassure Cameroon that the United States remains committed to assisting the country’s fight against Boko Haram. We have U.S. military advisors and trainers in Cameroon at the invitation of the [Cameroon] government to train and support the Cameroonian security forces in their fight against Boko Haram, said Hoza, in the press release. This commitment is firm, and will continue for as long as Cameroon welcomes it. Though the APS mission is to train the Cameroonians to protect their borders and inland waterways, the waterways lead to the Lake Chad Basin, one of the areas where the COPALCO and FUMA work together, an area where Boko Haram is known to operate. Cameroonian Navy Lieutenant Commander Patrick Nnon Mabiom, COPALCO commander, and his troops are in their third iteration with the U.S. Marines and the partnership has already paid its dividends. In the past year, Mabiom and his troops employed the Marines’ training from past engagements to combat illicit trafficking and terrorism and welcomes future training opportunities as we can continue to build on previous training and continue to get better. Because of this training, we are better prepared to address the security concerns facing our country, said Mabiom. Whether it’s stopping illicit trafficking or fighting Boko Haram or any other threat, we have the training we need to get the job done. We hope to continue this partnership because we [U.S. and Cameroon] can see the benefits coming out of it. Murray said the training they are conducting significantly contributes to the great partnership between the two countries that only gets stronger every time we work together. When we work with our Cameroonian partners to assist them to counter terrorism and illicit trafficking, it goes to show that both sides are committed to provide a safe environment for everyone, said Murray. They are brave, willing and ready to stop what the bad guys are doing to their country, whether it’s illicit trafficking of drugs and weapons or terrorism. This is a mutually beneficial engagement."}

The Johns Hopkins-Baltimore Collaborative for Violence Reduction will promote, develop, and evaluate interventions aimed at curbing violence. We know that persistent violence in Baltimore tears at the fabric of our neighborhood and of our city, Johns Hopkins University President Ronald J. Daniels said at a news conference this morning announcing the partnership. You don't have to look very far to see the pain that violence is causing the families, friends, neighbors, and communities of the victims. Our entire city is affected by this scourge. ... The goal of this project is to put knowledge into action to make our community safer.The effort will be directed by Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, and Sheldon Greenberg, professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Education. Violence researcher Cassandra Crifasi of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health will serve as deputy director. The JHU research team will work closely with Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis and other senior leaders in the police department.Webster told The Baltimore Sun that the effort is sort of a service project in answer to the question: How can Hopkins help Baltimore police in being most effective in combatting violent crime and doing it in a way that repairs the relationship in the community as well?The researchers and police have worked together to identify six priority projects to begin their violence reduction efforts:Assessing ongoing efforts to remove the most violent criminals from Baltimore streets: Researchers will assess two current efforts to determine where they have been effective and where they may be improved—B-Fed, an initiative to establish a homicide and violence reduction task force involving the Baltimore Police Department and federal law enforcement agencies; and The War Room, established in July 2015 to identify and remove from the streets the most important individuals driving gun violence.Deterring illegal gun possession and use: Illegal gun possession is closely tied to Baltimore's homicides and nonfatal shootings. Researchers will work with police to develop evidence-based programs and procedures designed to reduce illegal gun availability and possession.Fighting crime and building relationships with residents: Researchers will develop a foot patrol initiative for the Baltimore Police Department that will involve meeting with command staff, developing curricula, creating patrol officer and supervisory guidance, and assessing the efforts for continuous improvement.Improving rewards for crime tips: Baltimore has one of the smallest reward systems among major U.S. cities for citizens to provide information that helps police solve crimes. Researchers will review best practices and recommend the most effective way implement an improved tips program in Baltimore.Coordinating the District Commander Summit and Regional Field Commanders Forum. The District Commanders Summit will bring together the nine district commanders serving the Baltimore Police Department—a group responsible for the majority of front-line police services provided to communities—to enhance their effectiveness and impact. Greenberg will serve as coordinator, facilitator, and aide to the group. Improving police recruitment efforts. Researchers will conduct a three-session seminar series focused on enhancing recruiting efforts by and on behalf of the Baltimore Police Department. At the end of the three sessions, recommendations will be conveyed in a formal report to Davis and senior leadership of the Baltimore Police Department. The collaborative will be funded in its first year with $250,000 from both the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Abell Foundation. The Annie E.

The refugees returned voluntarily, in what is expected to be the first of many such flights coordinated between the governments in Kabul and Berlin as well as the International Organization for Migration, according the German embassy in Kabul. Seeking to escape the violence and economic malaise that continue to grip their home country, Afghans make up a major portion of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been pouring into Europe, which has struggled to find ways to accommodate the arrivals. Officials in Kabul greeted the returning refugees with signs saying Welcome back, Afghanistan needs you. After a difficult way to Germany in the hands of people smugglers they realized their future is in Afghanistan and that they are needed in their home country, the German embassy said in a statement. Many Afghans made their way to Germany, but in recent months the German government has launched media campaigns to dissuade would-be refugees from making the trip, warning of dangerous human traffickers and limited opportunities in Europe. Afghans were 27 percent of the more than 100,000 refugees who made the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean Sea in January, second only to the number fleeing war-torn Syria, according to data collected by the United Nations."}

Dell SecureWorks, the IT security subsidiary of Dell, found that Australia is the third-most-targeted country from 17 examined in a report on banking botnets. The term, which combines the words robot and network, refers to internet-linked computers that maliciously launch repetitive tasks designed to damage information systems. Dell says Australia is the third-most-targeted country in the world by banking botnets. Threats are becoming more sophisticated, incorporating emerging technologies, advanced cryptography, and resilient infrastructure to resist surveillance and disruption, says the report, published on Friday. Dell says 80 per cent of global attacks are on financial institutions in the United States. The United Kingdom is the next-most-targeted market, then Australia. Attacks in Asia are increasing and cyber attackers are also targeting bank customers as banking moves to mobile. With banks continuously moving to the mobile platform for payment and banking applications, cyber-criminals' interest in targeting mobile banking services has increased. Pallav Khandhar, a senior security researcher at Dell SecureWorks, said one technique growing in popularity involves hackers attempting to lure victims to download and install malicious banking applications while the user thinks they are merely updating their bank application. This then allows attackers to intercept banking sessions on [the] victim's mobile, allowing them to steal banking account credentials and/or money from their victim's account, Mr Khandhar said. After Commonwealth Bank of Australia's interim results earlier this month, chief executive Ian Narev told Fairfax Media that cyber-security is a matter of national importance and the government is showing a high level of understanding about potential threats. Cyber-security should not be seen as an issue of competitive advantage, he said, and it is crucial for banks, telecommunications companies and government to work together on resilience measures. Now you can imagine in the same way as there people for a long period of time have unfortunately tried to break into branches, there are always going to be people who want to have a go against all sorts of institutions from a cyber perspective, he said. Anybody in a big company or public institution will tell you there is an ongoing level of activity ... and we watch that very carefully and make sure we are well positioned to react to that, and we are. That is why we are investing tens of millions of dollars in making the bank as safe as it possibly can be and that is going to be one of those categories of investment that never goes way. CBA has joined forces with UNSW to overhaul its cyber-security curriculum and build an education centre as part of a $1.6 million five-year partnership. The federal's government's innovation statement pledged $22 million over four years for a new cyber-security growth centre. Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens said last year the already considerable resources devoted to IT security will grow further as awareness increases of cyber risk and its consequences. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority works with banks on penetration testing, vulnerability management and wants banks to adopt a systematic approach to managing and securing operating systems and software. In the United States, JPMorgan went public last year about attacks that resulted in one of the largest data breaches in history, which some sources blamed on Russian authorities seeking retribution for US-led sanctions. In late 2012, intruders caused major disruptions to the online banking sites of Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&T and HSBC. These were largely distributed 'denial of service' attacks, where hackers direct huge volumes of traffic onto a site until it crashes, thereby denying customers service."}

The department issued one set of guidelines to assist non-federal entities on how to share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures, and another set to detail how the federal government will share and use said information. The DHS also issued interim guidelines to define how the department will implement its own process to conduct a privacy review of received information and ensure compliance with the new law over time. Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said in a statement Tuesday that his department has improved its sharing system and added new capabilities to address the requirements of the new law. We know many cyber intrusions can be prevented if we share cyber threat indicators, Johnson said. These can include, for example, the subject line of a spear phishing email, or the IP address of the computer from which it originated, he said. Johnson contended that by sharing this kind of information in real-time and by swiftly applying defensive measures, the government and private sector can work together to more effectively prevent attacks. Johnson said he encourages companies to work with the DHS to set up the technical infrastructure needed to share and receive cyber threat indicators in real-time. He said that he welcomes feedback from privacy advocates and private sector participants in the Automated Indicator Sharing system."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":142,"title":" InfraGard CEO: Satellite Operators Need to be Ready for Cyber Attacks","class":0,"body":" [Via Satellite 02-23-2016] Satellite companies should be ready for increased attention from cyber criminals that will very likely lead to an increase in cyber attacks, according to Jerry Bowman, president and CEO of the InfraGard National Members Alliance. InfraGard is a partnership between the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and individuals from the private sector that work together to prevent attacks against the country. The organization covers all 16 critical infrastructures, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), creating a collaborative environment to protect against cyber-intrusions and firm up vulnerabilities. Bowman told Via Satellite that because satellites influence so many sectors —transportation, finance, military, energy, the environment and more — and consequently cuts across most, if not all, of the 16 critical infrastructures, that satellites are incredibly important to personal, business and government activities. Attempts to interrupt, block or manipulate satellite communications could have serious detrimental effects, and the satellite industry should be ready for more attempts of this nature in the coming years. If I were able to give advice to the satellite industry and its companies, it would be to look at the creative and extremely damaging cyber events that have occurred in other areas of technology and business, Bowman said. As we harden other areas of our critical infrastructure following successful cyber attacks, it is inevitable that sooner or later the full attention of organized crime, state actors or terrorists will turn to the satellite industry. I would encourage satellite companies to be ready for what’s coming. It’s no longer a question of ‘if,’ it’s a question of ‘when.’ Bowman said the reputation of the satellite industry is unproven when it comes to cybersecurity. Media reports of vulnerabilities in satellite systems have caused some unease about the industry’s ability to thwart hackers and cybercriminals. The general perception of the satellite industry’s preparedness is mixed — with many experts suggesting that it is lagging behind the rest of the communications sector. Events targeting satellites are not isolated and they are likely to increase. The industry needs to spend money on security, to avoid both potential larger financial loss and threats to safety, he said. Bowman said cybersecurity strategies are changing today to be more comprehensive. The practice of cybersecurity has shifted from focusing on the soft aspect of information assurance, where the mission was protection of data from attacks that compromised its integrity or confidentiality, to expanding to include protection of infrastructure for processing, transporting and storing critical data. According to Bowman, this ranges from the building and building systems that house the data center or enterprise offices, to the factory and production lines that manufacture products. Bowman said security standards are also shifting away from letting past attacks form the primary basis for new rules, and that this shift has influenced greater collaboration between industry and government. Every breach or discovery of a new threat actor has led to a response that attempts to protect against that threat, he explained. The evolution of the threat actor has forced government and the private sector to begin to collaborate under the assumption that pooled resources will allow us to get ahead of the bad guys. The objective is to move beyond reactive into proactive cybersecurity, where standards provide both government and industry a reliable roadmap that gives protection against the professional/organized-crime, state-sponsored and terrorist threat actors. The FBI supported the creation of InfraGard nearly 20 years ago for this purpose, and today its membership exceeds 44,000 members. Bowman said companies are not members, though industry partners do receive benefits similar to what corporate members would get. He said that, at this stage, he was unaware of satellite companies that are members, but this could be changing as InfraGard is growing at a pace of roughly 1,000 new members per month. Bowman said 4,000 prospective members are being processed, so it is very likely that InfraGard has employees of satellite companies who are among its ranks. These would most likely be in InfraGard’s critical communications sector, which is the organization’s largest group of members. As InfraGard’s numbers swell, Bowman said Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are growing in importance. He highlighted SIGs as a way satellite professionals could rally together within InfraGard to address cybersecurity concerns unique to the industry. SIGs are a growth area for us, which permits communities of professionals to develop a cross-sector mission and organize themselves. Our best example of a successful SIG is our Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) special interest group. The EMP SIG has gained national attention for the work it has done in identifying the risk and mitigation of EMP threats and threat actors. In fact, they actively hold working group meetings across the U.S. and have released a number of publications that are available via Internet websites. We would be open to facilitating a satellite communications SIG if enough interest was identified within our membership, said Bowman."}

In general, I think it would be a good idea, but I do understand why Apple might not be particularly fond of this government, because they’ve been so dishonest in so many other areas, but if we get an administration that is trustworthy, I believe one of the first things that we’re gonna push for are the right kinds of public-private partnerships, Carson said when asked whether he sided with the government in forcing Apple to provide them with specialized software to break into the phone. The FBI ordered Apple to design specialized software to break into the phone, but Cook has said the software would be too dangerous to create, because it would threaten the digital privacy of other iPhone users, the Associated Press reported. Last week, the Obama administration told a U.S. magistrate judge it was open to less intrusive options in accessing the shooter’s phone and would even be willing to allow Apple to retain possession of and later destroy the software. Carson told Gallagher on Wednesday that public-private partnerships are necessary, because cyber crime will be the next weapon of mass destruction. We need to have a public-private partnership, because recognize that cyber crime is going to be the next weapon of mass destruction, and if we’re not willing to work together on that, we’re going to die together, Carson said."}

Some other aspects of the eight-point action plan — such as cooperation on pediatrics, and promotion of trade and investment involving small and medium-sized companies — will start later this year, according to the officials. Hiroshige Seko, the minister of economy, trade and industry, will provide more detail on the projects to Abe and President Vladimir Putin during their meeting Saturday on the sidelines of a summit of 21 Pacific Rim economies in Lima. Japan hopes to use the economic cooperation plan as leverage in pushing forward stalled territorial negotiations between the two countries, especially when Putin visits Japan on Dec. 15 and 16 for talks with Abe. The plan features bilateral economic cooperation in eight areas such as medicine, energy, cutting-edge technologies and industrialization of the Russian Far East. On top of Saturday’s summit, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida will visit Russia on Dec. 3 for talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to lay the groundwork for the Abe-Putin talks in mid-December. The planned projects include setting up an office of the government-backed Japan National Tourism Organization in Moscow as part of efforts to promote tourism between the two countries. On energy, Tokyo and Moscow will promote joint development of oil and gas fields, green energy projects and look to being technical collaboration in nuclear power generation. The two sides will expand the size of student exchanges from 2017. They will also conduct sports exchanges in the run-up to the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The two governments will also hold talks in the first half of 2017 on cooperating in the training of medical professionals as well as the sharing of medical information and technology. Additionally, Japan will help draw up urban development plans for Russia by summer next year to address issues such as traffic congestion and waste disposal, with a pilot program to be conducted in the southwestern Russia city of Voronezh."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":147,"title":" RI and Turkey to cooperate economically, share intelligence","class":0,"body":" Cooperating on economic and intelligence issues was the main focus of the commitment made by Indonesia and Turkey when both countries' leaders met on Friday. The commitment was made following a bilateral meeting between President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Merdeka Palace, Central Jakarta. Jokowi said he and Erdogan ' who arrived in Jakarta late Thursday for a three-day visit 'had discussed a number of issues, including economics and terrorism, in the bilateral meeting, that he called 'open, friendly and very productive'. 'We have discussed several issues, such as global issues related to terrorism and the situation in the Middle East. But we focused on the economic sector,' Jokowi said during a joint press conference. 'We have agreed to soon settle existing trade barriers. We have also agreed that it is now time for a joint commission, focusing on the economy, to meet sometime this year to explore existing potentials so that those that exist can be improved. 'According to Jokowi, the two countries are also seeking to cooperate in the military equipment industry, small vessels manufacturing industry and power plant industry. According to the Foreign Ministry, Turkey was Indonesia's 7th biggest trade partner in the European region with two-way trade reaching US$2.47 billion in 2014. Natural rubber, polyester synthetic fiber, palm oil and textiles are among Indonesia's main commodities exports to Turkey. Turkey's investment in Indonesia reached $64.1 million with 29 projects last year. Jokowi thought the two countries shared many similarities and were internationally intertwined in platforms such as MIKTA (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Australia), the G20 and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). 'The two countries also play their own strategic roles in their respective regions,' he added. Erdogan, who brought along a delegation of more than 200 businesspeople, said his visit aimed to strengthen trade and economic ties with Indonesia 'on the basis of mutual benefits for both countries'. 'We will hold a business forum [the Turkey-Indonesia Business Forum] tomorrow [Saturday]. I hope the forum will be the place where we can produce new projects,' he said. In terms of intelligence cooperation, both countries discussed joint efforts in the fight against terrorism and the prevention of radicalism. In his remarks, Erdogan warned that terrorist groups from the Middle East could influence other regions. Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi said the two countries, however, did not specifically discuss the 16 Indonesian citizens, who had been reported missing in Turkey and allegedly joined the Islamic State (IS) movement. 'The point is that we [the two countries] agreed to enhance intelligence cooperation,' she said. In a public lecture at the National Resilience Institute (Lemhanas) earlier on Friday, Erdogan called on Indonesia and Turkey to fight against terrorism together as they had the same vision of eliminating the threat of extremism. One of the challenges is that some countries have shown their reluctance in sharing information about terrorism. 'Turkey is eager and sincere to establish this kind of relationship and we are happy to see that Indonesia shares the same values as we do. A strong political, social and economic relationship between Turkey and Indonesia will be beneficial for not only their people, but also for the whole world,' Erdogan said. He added that in order to resolve the most urgent conflicts in the Middle East, such as those in Syria and Iraq, any solution would have to adjust to a certain country's historical, political and cultural sensitivities as well as its social structure. 'Tolerance must be the practiced solution in resolving conflicts in Islamic countries because Islam does not advocate terrorism [...].'Erdogan and his delegation then performed Friday prayers at the Istiqlal Grand Mosque where he was accompanied by Vice President Jusuf Kalla."}

{"id":149,"title":" Russia and Israel cooperate to fight cyber-terrorism","class":0,"body":" The agreement involves a range of measures, several of which are focused particularly on the fight against the growing threat of Daesh (ISIS). Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told SCMagazineUK.com how cyber-terrorists are currently using the most sophisticated and advanced hacking tools and techniques, which enable them to carry out attacks on both business and state structures. He added that very often the level of technical capability of cyber-terrorists is now significantly more advanced than that of many IT security companies and state bodies. However, Barak added that the fight against cyber-threats has been complicated by the recent scandals associated with cyber-espionage and surveillance by the National Security Agency revealed by Snowden, which has generated mutual distrust between business and governments. And this distrust is being exploited by cyber-terrorists to help carry out their attacks. Ilya Sachkov, CEO of Group-IB, one of Russia's leading IT security companies, told SCMagazineUK.com that the number of cyber-attacks by ISIS on Russian and Israeli web-resources has significantly increased in recent months. There have been more than 1,000 such attacks in Russia since the beginning of the current year. The majority of them are accounted for by attacks on the web-resources of strategic industrial enterprises as well as websites of Russia's leading state corporations and state bodies. In addition to the fight with ISIS, both Russia and Israel plan to significantly strengthen IT security cooperation in the banking sector. Despite all the measures taken by the Russian government in recent years, Russian banks remain subject to more cyber-attacks than elsewhere. For example, last week at least 35 leading Russian banks suffered as a result of a massive cyber-attack, which resulted in losses of about RUB 5 billion (£56 million). Russia now plans to use Israel's national banking cyber-protection experience  and technologies to minimise further attacks. While Russia and Israel may be considered to have very different approaches to democracy, free speech and the rights of individual citizens, both are concerned about anti-state activity by sections of their populations.  As a result, both Russia and Israel are planning to establish stricter control over use of the Internet, and the exchange of data which has the potential for dual use, ie can potentially be used to harm the interests of the state. In addition, the governments of both countries plan to significantly expand the IT security powers of their law-enforcement agencies including introducing provisions for pre-trial blocking of suspicious web-resources and the arrest of potential cyber-terrorists. Separately, the US and Israel have also agreed this week to increase their cyber-cooperation, as reported by SCMagazineUK.com."}

Japan is our closest security partner in Asia and I want to significantly deepen defense cooperation between our two nations UK Defence Secretary Micheal Fallon said in a statement released to coincide with the visit. Fallon listed defense equipment cooperation, joint exercises, reciprocal access to military bases and military personnel exchanges among the areas the British want to see deeper cooperation on. The defence secretary was in Tokyo alongside British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond for meetings with their Japanese counterparts, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Defense Minister Gen Nakatani. Hammond also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In a joint statement released at the end of the visit, the two sides said they were taking forward a project known as the Joint New Air-to-Air Missile (JNAAM) to a second feasibility stage, having successfully concluded a first phase of work. An MoD spokesman said no details were available on the missile program. It has been widely reported though that the two sides are looking at a development of MBDA’s new ramjet-powered Meteor beyond a visual range missile built for British, French, Swedish and other air forces. New advanced, electronically scanned seeker technology involving Mitsubishi Electric is one possible development, according to the reports. Japan is purchasing the Lockheed Martin F-35 for its future combat air requirements and is looking for a new generation beyond a visual range air-to-air weapon capable of fitting in the aircraft's internal weapons bay — which the Meteor does. Aside from the possible long-term missile development, the joint statement said progress was being made on other possible defense equipment programs. A chemical and biological protection technology cooperative research project is already underway, and the statement confirmed the two sides would start a new joint study on personnel vulnerability evaluation. On the military front, the two sides said they would continue to develop a range of initiatives, including joint exercises on mine sweeping in the Arabian Gulf and potential cooperation in improving amphibious capabilities and counter-IED capabilities. The British said they are considering sending Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon combat jets to Japan later this year for an exercise and were looking at other exercise possibilities. It was also confirmed the two sides will be conducting a joint research project this year involving military cyber analysts. Joint cyber exercises are also on the agenda. The meeting comes at a time of rising tensions in the region triggered by Chinese island building strategy in the South China Sea and the North Korean announcement on Jan. 6 that it had tested a hydrogen bomb for the first time. The Japanese also have a growing territorial dispute with the Chinese over the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea. Japan was described in last November's British Government strategic defence and security review (SDSR) as London’s closet security partner in Asia. The review said Britain would considerably strengthen defense, political and diplomatic cooperation as Tokyo takes an increasingly global outlook on security issues. Recent years has seen Japan ease restrictions on the ability of Japanese armed forces to operate overseas and a ban on the export of defense equipment has also been partially lifted. In December, the Abe government announced a significant increase in its defense spending. The result of that easing of export restrictions saw Kawaski’s P-1 maritime patrol jet become a contender for Britain’s maritime patrol aircraft requirement before the UK government decided to acquire Boeing P-8s without holding a competition. In the run up to the decision, taken as part of the defense review, industry executives said Treasury ministers were interested in the P-1 as it generated far greater general trade opportunities for Britain than the purchase of the P-8. The move toward closer military ties first included the signing of a defense equipment cooperation framework and an information security agreement in mid-2013. That was followed by a defense and foreign ministers meeting in London early last year. However, Japan’s drive for collaborative partners is not limited to the British. France and India have also signed cooperation pacts in the last 12 months and the US has been a long-time partner across a range of programs."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":151,"title":" UK & Russia cooperate on ISS, but not on ISIS - why?","class":0,"body":" At the ISS (the International Space Station), Britain and Russia cooperate. But here, down on Earth, there's not much, if any, cooperation on fighting ISIS - despite Russia's repeated calls for the two countries to work together. It's been a strange week. On Tuesday, the first official British astronaut Tim Peake was fired into space in a Russian Soyuz rocket along with Russian Yuri Malenchenko and American Tim Kopra. Just one day after Russian technology helped take Tim Peake to the ISS, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond was at it again, ludicrously accusing Russia - which has inflicted more damage on ISIS in just a few weeks than the US and its allies have done in over a year of bombing - of actually helping the Islamic State in its Syrian operations. The good news is that Hammond the Hawk - the man who charmingly called the downing of Metrojet Flight 9268 over Sinai a warning shot for Moscow, is now looking quite isolated. It‘s a mistake to think that the entire British establishment shares his 1950s Cold War attitude toward Moscow. There's been quite a shift in recent weeks, with a number of politicians, eminent military figures and establishment-friendly journalists coming out and openly saying the UK should be allying with Russia to fight ISIL/ISIS. Here’s Admiral Lord West, Britain’s former First Sea Lord: The most important thing is that we’ve got to defeat and destroy ISIL – they are the most dangerous thing to all of the nations in the world. I describe them as ‘the wolf closest to the shed.’ We must destroy them and then think about getting security and peace to Syria. But the first thing is to destroy ISIL. And we can only do that, I believe, if the whole coalition is involved with Russia and also Iran, and, I am afraid, also with Assad. West was echoing the words of Lord Richards, the former head of the British armed forces, who called for a change in UK strategy in countering ISIS in September 2014. My judgment is that you do have to come to some accommodation with them [the Syrian government]. Russia, ironically could play a very important role in that and Iran. There are the bones for a grand strategic solution to the Middle East here, if we can get together with people who we viewed as rather hostile. One of the most high-profile political figures to call for a change in policy toward Russia is London Mayor Boris Johnson, a leading candidate to succeed David Cameron as Conservative Party leader. This is the time to set aside our Cold War mindset. It is just not true that whatever is good for Putin must automatically be bad for the West. We both have a clear and concrete objective – to remove the threat from ISIL. Everything else is secondary, he wrote in his Daily Telegraph column two weeks ago. By calling for an anti-ISIS alliance with Moscow, Johnson is taking a very different position from his great rival for the Tory leadership, the uber-hawk Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who has strong neocon connections. Prominent journalists and media figures who have praised Russia’s anti-ISIS fight include Piers Morgan. When Russia intervened in Syria in September, Morgan penned a piece for the Daily Mail, entitled: Thank God there’s a strong leader willing to stand up for America’s interests in the Middle East - shame it’s not Obama. ISIS thus threatens every one of us, Morgan wrote. But Obama seems utterly neutered on how to arrest their charge, muttering meaningless platitudes and putting on his best ‘We have to do something, folks’ face. Putin is no such shrinking violet. He understands the very real menace ISIS poses and he knows how best to deal with it. Of course these articles calling for closer London-Moscow cooperation on fighting ISIS contain the obligatory attacks on President Putin - it’s one of the unwritten rules of the game in the western media that if you do want better relations with an official enemy state you still need to tell readers how awful the other side is, otherwise you’ll be condemned as an apologist or appeaser, by the new McCarthyites who patrol the media and internet in their hunt for foreign policy heretics. Even so, we shouldn’t underplay what is happening. We are witnessing an establishment split in Britain - with the neocons and hard-core Russophobes now being challenged by foreign policy realists from within the political and media elite and not just from without. Any objective commentator or military expert can see the logic of the UK working with Russia and the Syrian government to defeat ISIS. In fact we can say that anyone who seriously wants to defeat ISIS militarily knows that a tie-up between London, Moscow and Damascus is a jolly good idea. The general public in Britain understand this too - just take a look at the letters pages of newspapers and the BTL comments which appear in response to articles on this topic. Brits know it wasn’t President Putin - or indeed President Assad - who ordered the brutal killing of British tourists while they were sunbathing on the beach in Tunisia last summer. And they know that neither Russia nor the Syrian government poses a threat to British civilians anywhere in the world. The British public wants to see ISIS defeated and they are questioning why our government doesn’t take the one step – i.e. an alliance with Russia and the secular Syrian government - which would greatly enhance that prospect. The answer, of course, is the continuing presence of neocons and Russophobes in the high echelons of British Establishment and in the media. For these groups, the number one priority remains regime change in Syria and the continued sanctioning of Russia. Defeating ISIS is not as important as keeping Russia in the cold and trying to get Assad and his secular government ousted. Last year was a good one for these people. They exploited the terrible MH17 air disaster to maximum effect, pinning the blame firmly on Moscow - before any evidence emerged - and used the events in Ukraine, triggered off by an illegal western-sponsored regime change, to portray Russia as a dangerous aggressor hell-bent on westward expansion. But in 2015, things haven’t gone as well for the neocon faction. By intervening against ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates in Syria in September, Putin effectively called the bluff of the US and their allies and showed to the world how phony the west’s fight against radical terrorist groups in Syria had been. Those who genuinely wanted to see fanatical head-choppers knocked back in Syria lauded the Russian actions - to the horror of neocon and paid-up anti-Kremlin propagandists who responded with the line that Russia wasn’t really targeting the Islamic State at all - a classic example of what psychologists call projection i.e. accusing your enemies of your own faults. One leading British journalist who did see through the phony war on ISIS and the western double standards towards Russia’s Syrian intervention was Mail on Sunday columnist Peter Hitchens. I don’t think the British or American governments really want to fight the Islamic State. They just want to look as if they are doing so. I judge these people by what they do, not by what they say…. The White House and Downing Street both seethe with genuine outrage about Russia’s bombing raids on Syria. Yet the people Vladimir Putin bombed have views and aims that would get them rounded up as dangerous Islamist extremists if they turned up in Manchester. So why do British politicians call them ‘moderates’ when Russia bombs them? Hitchens wrote in October. In early December, after the horrors of Paris, Prime Minister David Cameron took the case for bombing ISIS to the House of Commons, but significantly did not say the UK would be cooperating with Russia. Although he won the vote, he most certainly did not win the argument. And it wasn’t just Labour supporters of Jeremy Corbyn who weren‘t impressed. Labour MP John Mann, one of Corbyn’s most vociferous opponents, also voted against the government’s motion and called instead for an alliance with Russia to sort out the New Nazis. Time for the USA, France, UK and Russia to sort out the new Nazis: ISIS. Russia are not our enemy in Syria, they are our ally. — John Mann (@JohnMannMP) November 15, 2015 It is very obvious to me that we cannot stop ISIS if we, the French and the Americans do one thing in Syria whilst the Russians and Iran do another. There has to be one united effort to remove these murderers and a peace settlement for the rest of Syria alongside it, Mann wrote on his website. The anti-Russian line taken by Cameron and Co. is clearly not in the British national interest - which is why genuinely patriotic conservatives, experienced military figures and independently-minded politicians and journalists from across the spectrum are now openly challenging it. But can we realistically hope for a change in the UK’s official stance? As the UK always follows the US, any shift in British policy towards Russia will only come if there's a change in Washington. Perhaps we’ve seen signs of that in recent days with John Kerry’s recent visit to Moscow and a softening of the rhetoric deployed against Russia. But even if nothing much changes in Washington in the next few months - and we certainly shouldn’t build our hopes up - it’s likely that in 2016 the anti-Russian faction in the British establishment will find it harder than ever to justify its Cold War position. If the UK allied with the Soviet Union and Stalin in WWII to defeat the Nazis, why can’t we do the same to defeat ISIS, is what more and more people from within the establishment - as well as the general public, are asking. And if the UK and Russia can get along very well in space, why not on land, too? These are two very reasonable questions which no British neocon or obsessive Putin-basher can adequately answer."}

{"id":153,"title":" Russia And China Have A Cyber Nonaggression Pact","class":0,"body":" The two powers are advancing a vision of security in cyberspace that is markedly different from Western approaches. On May 8, the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China signed a bilateral agreement on cooperation in the field of international information security. The treaty, which some have dubbed a nonaggression pact for cyberspace, details cooperative measures both governments pledge to undertake, including exchange of information and increased scientific and academic cooperation. With this, Russia and China continue to advance their vision of information security, a view of security concerns in cyberspace that is markedly different from Western approaches of cybersecurity. Many observers have characterized the agreement as a largely political move at a time of heightened tensions with the United States and Europe. The alignment of Russia and China is seen as a response to growing Western pressure. Accordingly, Russia’s pivot to the East follows Western sanctions over its actions in Ukraine. However, a closer look reveals that the agreement follows a longstanding series of diplomatic initiatives launched by both countries. Already in 2009 Russia and China signed an agreement on cooperation in the field of international information security in the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Later, in 2011 both countries submitted a proposal for an international code of conduct for information security to the United Nations. Although the proposal failed to garner sufficient support in the relevant Committee of the General Assembly, Russia and China redoubled their efforts. An updated version of the code of conduct is currently circulating in the UN in time for this fall’s General Assembly session. All these initiatives sought to advance Russia’s and China’s views on a variety of cybersecurity issues while shoring up their positions in international discussions. This year’s bilateral agreement is no exception in this regard."}

Last May, German intelligence sources told Reuters that the BND had stopped sending the NSA information gathered from its surveillance station in Bad Aibling in Bavaria. That move, which followed allegations the BND had helped the NSA spy on European officials and firms, strained German-U.S. relations and created divisions within Chancellor Angela Merkel's government. German newspapers on Friday said that collaborations at the Bad Aibling station have been resumed and the NSA is again being supplied with intelligence by the BND. The station is considered central to surveillant crisis countries in the Middle East, such as Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Libya, the papers said. Officials did not immediately comment on the report but the move comes amid heightened security concerns across Europe following militant attacks in Paris on November 13 and an alert over possible suicide bombings in Munich over New Year's Eve.

Xi is the second leader of a United Nations Security Council member to visit Tehran after the nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers last year. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran in November. Iran emerged from years of economic isolation this month when the United Nations' nuclear watchdog ruled it had curbed its nuclear program, clearing the way for the lifting of UN, US, and European Union sanctions. Iran and China have agreed to increase trade to $US600 billion in the next 10 years, Rouhani said at a news conference with Xi broadcast live on state television.Iran and China have agreed on forming strategic relations [as] reflected in a 25-year comprehensive document, he said. Iran and China signed 17 accords on Saturday, including on co-operation in nuclear energy and a revival of the ancient Silk Road trade route, known in China as One Belt, One Road. China is still heavily dependent on Iran for its energy imports and Russia needs Iran in terms of its new security architecture vision for the Middle East, said Ellie Geranmayeh, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Iran plays quite an integral role for both China and Russia's interests within the region, much more than it does for the Europeans, Geranmayeh said. Xi was quoted as saying by China's Xinhua news agency: The China-Iran friendship ... has stood the test of the vicissitudes of the international landscape. The Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper wrote in an editorial on Saturday that China hoped to improve ties with Iran as part of its sweeping plan to rebuild trade links with Europe and Asia and carve out new markets for its goods. China is of course considering its self interest in strengthening co-operation with Iran, especially at a time when China is in the midst of expending efforts to push forward the One Belt, One Road initiative, Iran is an important fulcrum, the paper wrote. Rouhani said the countries had also agreed to co-operate on terrorism and extremism in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen. China signalled its support for Yemen's government, which is fighting an Iran-allied militia, during Xi's visit to Saudi Arabia, Iran's rival for influence in the region, this week. Iran has called on China to join the fight against Islamic State and play a more active role in the region. Tehran is widely credited with convincing Russia to start its military intervention in Syria and join the fight against Islamic State. Although China and Russia backed UN sanctions against Iran on its nuclear program, they were also heavily pushing for special waivers to continue trading with Iran, Geranmayeh said. Iran had a relationship both politically and economically with China and Russia for the last 10 years in ways that it hasn't had with Europe. So it's quite natural to see it opening up first to these countries. The Chinese President was to meet Iran's most powerful figure, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, later in the day."}

Rheinmetall-Canada and ELTA Systems, an Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI) subsidiary and group, have been awarded the significant Medium Range Radar (MRR) program by the Canadian Department of National Defense (DND). The radar to be supplied for the multi-mission role is the ELTA ELM-2084 MMR Iron Dome radar which includes C-RAM (Counter Rockets, Artillery and Mortars) and air-surveillance capabilities, and will be produced locally in cooperation with Rheinmetall-Canada. Following an extensive competition process and demanding demonstrations which also included live fire testing, the ELM-2084 MMR radar was selected due to its superior performance and outstanding capabilities. The ELM-2084 MMR is an advanced three-dimensional, S-Band radar, incorporating modular and scalable architecture, and is the world-leading multi-mission system. The solid-state, electronically-steered active array system incorporates Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology and offers exceptional detection and accuracy performance. The MMR is a highly mobile system, designed for fast deployment with a minimal crew. Designed to simultaneously perform hostile weapon locating, friendly-fire ranging and air surveillance, the ELM-2084 MMR radar is able to detect rockets, artillery and mortars at long ranges, and can simultaneously engage a large number of targets. Deployed in a C-RAM role, the MMR can provide fire control when integrated with a weapons system. Because of its superior tracking capabilities MMR delivers a reliable and improved air situation picture as well as reliable, uninterrupted tracking of any manoeuvring aircraft. Furthermore, it can detect and track low radar cross-section (RCS) targets. Advanced signal processing enables effective operation even in conditions of heavy clutter as well as in noisy and dense environments, with assured classification and identification of targets and superior low-altitude operation. The radar system also includes advanced Electronic Counter-Counter Measure (ECCM) capabilities. The two companies will implement a technology transfer program in full conformity with the intent of Canada’s recently announced Defence Procurement Strategy to create local jobs and capabilities and help spur economic growth. Said Rheinmetall Canada’s President and CEO, Dr. Andreas Knackstedt: ELTA was considered the partner of choice due to the program’s demanding requirements. The award of the MRR contract to the Rheinmetall/ELTA team is a testimony of Elta’s leading-edge technology and know-how for which it is recognized worldwide. Mr. Nissim Hadas, IAI Executive VP & ELTA President said Together, with our partners in Rheinmetall-Canada, we will provide the most sophisticated C-RAM,air-surveillance and radar available, with a significant portion of the production to be performed locally in Canada."}

Israel is said to have finalized its shopping list of desired US military material as part of a new long-term agreement for US defense assistance to Israel to maintain its qualitative edge in the region. On the list, and reportedly approved in principle by the US, is an Israeli request for V-22 Ospreys, planes which are believed capable of reaching Iran and which Israel reportedly sought from the US in 2012 — and was refused — when contemplating a strike on Iran’s Fordow enrichment facility. … Under a separate budgetary hierarchy, the US administration is understood to be well-disposed to ensure funding for Israel’s missile defense systems — maintaining and improving the Iron Dome and the Arrow systems, and deploying David’s Sling, to ensure Israel can counter threats from neighboring Gaza, south Lebanon and Syria, as well as from an Iran that is relentlessly developing its ballistic missile systems. The increasing involvement of Iran and Russia across Israel’s northern border raises new challenges on which Israel and the US are said to largely see eye-to-eye. … Israel has already contracted for more than 30 F-35 multirole fighter planes; it may ultimately want 50, or even 75. It also seeks a host of F-15 jets which incorporate Israeli-developed advanced technologies and are considered the workhorse of the Israeli Air Force. At a news conference with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon last week, American Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter stressed the benefits of military cooperation between the two countries: Our defense relationship spans the entire spectrum from tunnels and terrorists right up through the high-end. That’s one of the reasons why we’ll be with the F-35 tomorrow. We work on all of the techniques, tactics and procedures regarding high-end warfare, in this case warfare from the air, right down to tunnels. […] This is one of the most trusted relationships we have in the world and so when we discover something that is critical to both of us, we share it, and we do that from electronic warfare to cyber to all kinds of […] tremendous intelligence sharing.

OpenAI will also make Microsoft Azure its preferred cloud platform, in part because of its existing support for AI workloads with the help of Azure Batch and Azure Machine Learning, as well as Microsoft’s work on its recently rebranded Cognitive Toolkit. Microsoft also offers developers access to a high-powered GPU-centric virtual machine for these kind of machine learning workloads. These N-Series machines are still in beta, but OpenAI has been an early adopter of them and Microsoft  says they will become generally available in December. Amazon already offers a similar kind of GPU-focused virtual machine, though oddly enough, Google has lagged behind and — at least for the time being — doesn’t offer this kind of machine type yet. Through this partnership, Microsoft and OpenAI will advance their mutual goal to democratize AI, so everyone can benefit, a Microsoft spokesperson told me when I asked for specifics about the partnership. Microsoft Research researchers will partner with researchers at OpenAI to advance the state of AI and OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure and Microsoft‘s N-series hardware for their future research and development, and explore tools such as Microsoft’s Cognitive Toolkit for their research. Microsoft didn’t want to comment on whether there is any monetary component to the partnership. In addition to the OpenAI partnership, Microsoft also today launched its Azure Bot Service, a new service that will allow developers to most easily and cost-effectively host their bots on Azure. The service sits on top of the serverless Azure Functions tool and Microsoft Bot Framework. Using Azure Functions ensures that you only pay when your bot is actually being used."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":165,"title":"UK commits £1.9B to National Cyber Security Strategy, working with Microsoft and more","class":0,"body":"The recent rush of allegations against countries like Russia and China and their possible roles in cyber attacks on countries like the U.S. have prompted a big move from the UK: the government said today that it plans to invest £1.9 billion ($2.3 billion) over the next five years in a new cyber defence plan, called the National Cyber Security Strategy, to prepare for and fight back against cyber attacks in the future. The investment, detailed by Chancellor Philip Hammond today in a speech at a Microsoft event in London (and here), will also involve new partnerships with private and public organisations (including Microsoft) to develop technology. Our new strategy, underpinned by £1.9 billion of support over five years and excellent partnerships with industry and academia, will allow us to take even greater steps to defend ourselves in cyber-space and to strike back when we are attacked, he said. The size of the investment makes this the largest funding that the UK has earmarked for cyber security services, but it’s not the only one: in October the Defence Secretary earmarked £265 million specifically for cyber vulnerability at the Ministry of Defence. They are also not sudden actions: today’s news comes nearly a year after the government first started to talk about how it needed to get more proactive in cyber security defence. Today’s news has a two-fold purpose, Hammond noted today in his presentation. It’s in part about protecting the government, but also about protecting the wider UK digital economy, since cyber attacks would directly impact confidence in the latter. Tech is the future of the UK economy, he said in his speech at Microsoft’s Future:Decoded event today, as he described a landscape where businesses and people will feel safe to do business. Interestingly, while there will likely be many other companies involved, it seems that the biggest to get billing and a name check today is Microsoft. The mobile-first, cloud-first world holds enormous potential for organisations and individuals to generate new and exciting growth opportunities, said Cindy Rose, UK CEO, Microsoft, in a statement. However, there is a corresponding risk that as people increase their technology usage they also increase their exposure to cyber security threats. It is critical for all organisations to strengthen their core security hygiene as well as creating a pervasive security culture through education and awareness. All participants in the security ecosystem also need to work together to ensure everyone can trust the technology they use. The Chancellor’s announcement is the kind of initiative that the UK needs to protect British citizens from the growing threats we face. We welcome the government’s focus on tackling this significant issue which affects business and individuals alike. There are three areas where the government will be targeting investment, Hammond said today: Defence will be about the government investing in its own systems and those of larger utility-based industries that partly come under its regulatory remit such as energy and transport, as part of a Critical National Infrastructure strategy. One company the government is highlighting here is Netcraft for automated defence techniques to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks by hackers, stopping viruses and spam emails ever reaching their intended victims for example. This will also include defenses against phishing attacks. Deter covers law enforcement capabilities to fight cybercrime in the National Cyber Crime Unit, as well as more international partnerships. The UK will defend itself in cyberspace and strike back against those that try to harm our country, a statement notes. The government is already recruiting cybercrime investigators and tech specialists, it said. Develop is focused on education and future R&D. A new Cyber Security Research Institute will be a virtual collection of UK universities which will look to improve the security of smart phones, tablets and laptops through research that could one day make passwords obsolete. It’s notable that the first Innovation Centre will be located in Cheltenham, not far from the GCHQ where the government runs its surveillance and other covert programs. This is also likely the category under which the National Cyber Security Centre, announced earlier this year, will also fall. Today is very much a high-level news announcement. As it begins to take shape, there will likely be a lot of questions about how far the UK plans to go in its bid to protect the UK and UK plc, with many who are already up in arms about its surveillance activities and more likely also to raise questions about how the plans announced today will impact our privacy, and our data. Th bigger picture here is that for now the government is laying out a policy both to the UK and the rest of the world to say that it’s aware and it plans to fight whatever might come. No longer the stuff of spy thrillers and action movies, cyber-attacks are a reality and they are happening now. Our adversaries are varied – organised criminal groups, ‘hactivists’, untrained teenagers and foreign states, said Ben Gummer, Minister for the Cabinet Office & Paymaster General, said in a statement. The first duty of the government is to keep the nation safe. Any modern state cannot remain secure and prosperous without securing itself in cyberspace. That is why we are taking the decisive action needed to protect our country, our economy and our citizens."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":166,"title":"Police forces team up to tackle cyber crime across West Mercia, Warwickshire and the West Midlands","class":0,"body":"POLICE are launching a major new survey to find out how cyber crime is affecting people across the region. Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) for West Mercia, Warwickshire and the West Midlands have joined forces with Warwickshire County Council to launch the second annual cyber crime survey. The survey asks residents to share their experiences of online crime through a series of 36 questions. The information gathered will give the PCCs a better picture of online crime in their areas and help to shape services. John Campion, West Mercia’s PCC, said: Cyber is an emerging area of crime and it is important to understand how it is impacting our communities if we are going to be effective in tackling it. This survey will help ensure we listen to our communities and can focus our work on the biggest priorities. We must have an agile, dynamic approach to cyber crime though to ensure our work keeps pace with new cyber threats. Launched in Warwickshire last year, the survey showed nearly a quarter of a million people felt at risk online, but 2.4 per cent had no idea how to protect themselves while using the internet. It revealed more than half of respondents had been targeted by phishing scams, with one in 10 going on to become victims. It also showed under 18s are most targeted for online harassment or bullying, with women targeted twice as much as men. Cllr John Horner, Warwickshire County Council’s portfolio holder for community safety, said: Cyber crime is a growing community safety issue as victims can be seriously affected, not just financially but also emotionally, with feelings of depression, and sometimes worse, as a result. The economic impact on local businesses of cyber crime is also something that cannot be underestimated. West Mercia Police and Warwickshire Police have together launched the #BeCyberSmart campaign in a bid to raise awareness of how members of the public can stay safe online."}

(Source: Reuters) Underlining economic challenges in the current global environment, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday said India and the UK can leverage technological prowess to create new opportunities, while seeking investments in defence, manufacturing and aerospace sectors. Speaking at the India-UK Tech Summit, Modi showcased his government’s initiatives in sectors like smart cities, startups and digital economy as he sought enhanced engagement with Britain. Together, we can create a vibrant and thriving environment for new commercial applications with breakthrough technologies, he said at the event, also attended by visiting UK Prime Minister Theresa May. Modi further said that both countries face numerous economic challenges in the current global environment which directly affect trade and commerce. Here is the full text of PM Modi’s speech: Your Excellency, Prime Minister Theresa May Members of the media, Friends, Excellency, I am honoured to welcome you to India. We deeply appreciate that you have chosen India for your first bilateral visit outside Europe. Last week was a period of great festivities in India. You also celebrated Diwali with much fanfare in London. Your visit today gives us reasons to celebrate the vibrant and strong India-UK partnership. Friends, India-UK ties are truly special. It is an enduring partnership, which is nurtured by: our shared values; extensive people to people linkages lets not forget cricket here; wide spread economic engagement for the prosperity of our societies; common efforts aimed at the security of our people; and a common vision for a peaceful and prosperous world. Our Strategic Partnership is geared towards meeting the existing, new and emerging challenges of the twenty first (21st) century and contributing to the larger regional and global good. Friends, In my extensive discussions with Prime Minister May today, we looked at the full range of our partnership. The spread and depth of our engagement has indeed been impressive. We also agreed to add new domains and initiatives to broaden the scope of our linkages. Earlier this morning, Prime Minister May and I jointly inaugurated the India-UK Tech Summit. It marked a fitting celebration of 2016 as the India-UK Year of Education, Innovation and Research. Science and Technology is a vibrant and fast growing space in our partnership. It is an area of tremendous potential and promise. It allows for the convergence of novel ideas, new research and next generation technologies. And, brings the benefits of science and technology collaboration to the lives of common people, not just in India and the UK, but in the entire world. At the Summit, new bilateral initiatives on clean energy development and energy efficient building materials were announced. These would be critical for development of Smart Cities and to our quest for innovative solutions to tackle challenges of climate change and sustainability. Friends, Growing business partnerships, and expanding trade and capital flows between our two economies are crucial to our economic partnership. Indian companies have been successfully raising finance from the City of London. We are encouraged by the London Stock Exchange presently hosting several Rupee denominated Masala bonds. It reflects the strong investor confidence in the fast growing Indian economy. A meeting of the India-UK CEOs Forum, held earlier today and their valuable recommendations, would help us deepen business to business ties. The meeting of the India-UK Joint Economic and Trade Committee later this afternoon will take forward the business agenda. We have also agreed to establish a Joint Working Group on Trade. We believe that such a group should not only focus on ways to increase trade in goods, but also on the expansion of services trade, including through greater mobility of skilled professionals. Friends, I also discussed defence and security partnership with Prime Minister May. I encourage British companies to look at the multiple opportunities in the Indian defence sector. Looking beyond trade in defence equipment, I invite them to build partnerships with Indian enterprises that focus on manufacturing, technology transfer and co-development. Security of the Cyber space, especially involving our critical infrastructure is an area of shared interest. I welcome our growing cooperation in this field. I also discussed with Prime Minister May, ways to purposefully work together to combat the growing forces of radicalization and terrorism. We agreed that it is not a limited security challenge. Its arc of threat spreads across nations and regions. Terrorists moves across borders with ease, and endanger the entire humanity. I conveyed our deep concerns to Prime Minister May regarding cross-border terrorism and the need for the international community to take strong action against States that support and sponsor terrorism. Friends, India-UK global partnership is expanding. There is growing convergence of our views on leading global issues. I thanked Prime Minister May for UK’s consistent support for India’s membership of the UN Security Council and Nuclear Suppliers Group. We also agreed on the need for early adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. Excellency, Our multifaceted relationship is, indeed, unique. Your visit to India and the outcome of our discussions today would add new dimensions and substance that would further strengthen India-UK partnership. I also take this opportunity to convey my best wishes to the English cricket team, who will begin their campaign in Rajkot, Gujarat, day after tomorrow. May the best team win! Excellency, Let me once again extend a very warm welcome to you and your delegation to India. Thank you. Thank you very much."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":171,"title":"International Cyber Security Cooperation","class":0,"body":"he rapid development of digital technologies and wide range of services provided for activities in cyberspace raises the issue of cyber security as a serious concern for governments around the world. Cybercrimes pose a direct threat to the security of critical infrastructures and Information Technologies (IT) as a low-cost asymmetric warfare element. Most countries are aware of the vulnerability of information technologies, abuse of public data provided on the internet and the great importance of shielding critical infrastructures. Nations adapt their own national strategies and policies to cope with the threat of potentially devastating cyberattacks. Policy makers in different countries are increasingly considering the use deterrence strategies to supplement national cyber defense. But it is rather hard to counteract the threat by means of merely ‘national’ cyber defense strategies and policies, given that cyberspace spans worldwide and attacks can be carried out from anywhere of the world. The internet has changed the political landscape of the planet in an extremely profound way. If the whole world is connected via the internet, cyber attacks are never just a national threat. With the advent of advanced information and communication technologies, crime now knows no jurisdictional or national boundaries. The very nature of the internet allows for unprecedented collaboration and interaction among particular communities of criminals. In February 2016, a spectacular bank hack occurred that stole $81 million from accounts at the Bangladesh Bank via the SWIFT system. SWIFT credentials of Bangladesh Bank employees were used by unknown hackers to send fraudulent money transfer requests to the US Federal Reserve Bank in New York asking to transfer nearly $1 billion from Bangladesh Bank’s funds held there to bank accounts in the Philippines, Sri Lanka and other parts of Asia. Despite separate investigations carried out by Bangladesh, Philippines and US authorities, the true identity and origin of those attacks are still undetected. Reportedly, almost eleven different cyber criminal groups including the Sony hack, which the US government attributed to North Korea, have been suspected to have connections with this central bank cyber heist. Following the Bangladesh Bank cyber heist, SWIFT sent out an alert to its members indicating that a second bank in Asia had been targeted in a similar attack. Though, in the past, cybercriminals were mainly individuals or small groups, today, heavily funded and highly organized cyber criminal groups are bringing together individuals from across the globe. As cybercrimes can be committed in real time from anyplace in the world in an unprecedented way, and they are hard to track, prosecute, and enforce penalties, therefore, criminals are increasingly turning to the internet to facilitate their activities and maximize their profit. Crimes committed in cyberspace are not necessarily new, such as theft, fraud etc. but they are rising in line with the opportunities presented by digital technologies. Consequently, cyber criminals are frequently holding the world to ransom. The Daily Mail (UK) reports (10 June 2014) that cyber attacks damage the global economy to the amount of more than £238 billion a year – almost equal to 0.5 per cent of the world’s total GDP. On the other hand, Juniper research (UK) predicts that cybercrime will cost businesses over $2 Trillion by 2019. Cyber attacks, by analogy, represent a threat to global peace and security as frightening and horrific as nuclear war. So every government, business entity, organizations and individuals who are using electronic data processing have no way to escape the threat of cyber attacks. While cybercrime is generally understood to mean unlawful access and attempts to unlawful access to computers, networks, and the information stored therein - all illegal, harmful and hostile activity on the internet - cyberterrorism, meanwhile, adds a new dimension of threat in cyberspace. Though cyberterrorism does not necessarily imply something different from cybercrime, it has a stronger meaning. Cyberterrorism usually describes acts done online that have similar characteristics to real-world terrorism attacks. As the statutory definition suggests, terrorism is usually intended to demoralize either a society or a civilian population in furtherance of some political or social objectives. To understand what cyberterrorism can – and will – be, we must examine how terrorists can use information and communication technology to gain those objectives. Using cyber attacks, terrorists can cause much wider damage to a country or region than they could by resorting to conventional physical violence. As a hypothetical example of cyberterrorism, a critical infrastructure such as a nuclear plant may be taken over by terrorists for destructive purposes. The Lipman Report (2010) states that During 2009, a series of cyber attacks were launched against popular government Web sites in the United States and other countries, effectively shutting them down for several hours and claims that most disturbing is the possibility that this limited success may embolden future hackers to attack critical infrastructure, such as power generators or air-traffic control systems — with devastating consequences for the economy and security. More recently, Bangladesh based the Daily Star (August 28, 2013) reports that in August 2013 media companies including the New York Times, Twitter and the Huffington Post lost control of some of their websites after a hacker group named Syrian Electronic Army supporting the Syrian government breached the Australian Internet company that manages many major site addresses. Cyberwarfare - as distinguished from cybercrime and cyberterrorism – can be defined as actions by a nation-state to break into another nation's computers, networks and the information stored therein for the purposes of gaining some military objectives i.e., achieving certain advantages over a competing nation-state or preventing a competing nation-state from achieving advantages over them. Cyberwarfare generally constitutes the use of cyberspace by nation states to achieve the same general goals they pursue through the use of conventional military force. Some governments are increasingly making it an integral part of their overall military strategy, having invested heavily in cyber warfare capability. The Chinese Defense Ministry has confirmed the existence of a cyberwarfare unit officially claimed to be engaged in cyber-defense operations. There are reports published in Washington Times that the People’s Republic of China is frequently launching cyberattacks that are intended to disable Taiwan’s infrastructure and defeat the capacity of that island’s government and economy. In May 2007, Estonia faced mass cyberattack soon after removal of a Soviet World War II war memorial from downtown Tallinn. In August 2008, during the Russia-Georgia War cyberattacks caused the Parliament of Georgia and Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs websites to be replaced by images comparing Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili to Adolf Hitler. Several other incidents of cyberwarfare are increasingly being reported between different state sponsored cyber defense groups and military cyber units, most commonly, US-China, US-Russia, Israel-Iran, North Korea-South Korea, India-Pakistan etc. Since crimes in the cyberspace often transcend a nation’s boundaries in being committed, actions to cope with them must also be of an international nature. While threats arising out of cybercrime, cyberterrorism or cyberwarfareare increasing rapidly with the advent of information and communication technology, international law to deal with cybercrime has been slow to adapt. The International Cybercrime Treaty (ICT) is the first and only international treaty to date seeking to address internet and computer crime by harmonizing national laws, improving investigative techniques, focusing on regulatory initiatives and increasing cooperation among nations. Due to the heterogeneity of law enforcement and technical countermeasures of different countries, the Treaty is far ranging in the areas it attempts to address and touch upon. Given the myriad of issues arising from the Treaty, much controversy has sprung up over various points. It is silent about the most crucial issues rapidly evolving in cyberspace such as cyberterrorism or cyberwarfare. The main failings of existing international Treaty systems that touch on cyber law are that most do not carry enforcement provisions. Treatments of cybercrime or cyberwarfare outside the orthodox international human rights law (IHRL) or international humanitarian law (IHL) framework are almost absent. On the other hand, issues relating to cyberspace are multidimensional and too complex to fit easily under the mainstream IHRL and IHL framework. This renders the tension between classifying cyber attacks as merely criminal, or as matters of state survival resorting to the same rationales as conventional threats to national security and which then creates a vacuum for cybercrime to grow bigger. As cyberspace is not a customary arena over which a Sate may exercise its national jurisdiction or State sovereignty and, thus, challenges arising out of it are unique, the situation therefore requires exceptional regulatory solutions. Some have argued that cyberspace is international commons - resource domains or areas that lie outside of the political reach of any one nation. To the extent cyberspace is international commons, it requires the common vision of the international community to deal with the issue. By fostering international cooperation, nations can tackle the problem of the borderless nature of cybercrime by enabling actions beyond the borders of a single nation. This will be a win-win situation for all countries coming forward to cooperate. It is important for the international community to establish a comprehensive regime for various types of cyber threats through a new international accord dealing exclusively with cyber security and its status in international law. Until such an accord becomes politically viable, it is important to examine how existing treaty systems may extend to handle the challenges presented by cyber threats. In addition to each country taking individual measures and actions for their own cyber security, all stakeholders in the global cyberspace need to cooperate and assist each other One of the most urgent needs for the international community is to establish an inclusive mechanism to regulate cyberspace. The best way to ensure international cyber security is to form an appropriate legal regime for the various types of cyber threats e.g. cybercrime, cyberterrorism or cyberwarfare - whether it is humanitarian law (laws of war), human rights law or some novel combination of treaty systems. Before thinking about cyber security, an institution has to define what is worthy to protect. The institution will also be in charge of building fundamentals for dynamic cyber defense, implementing relevant international cyber security treaties and laws, functioning as catalyst for discussion among different disputant States and other entities, and harmonizing with other treaty systems. The institution will have a comprehensive jurisdiction to appropriately address the risks associated with the revolution in information and communication technology. There should be also a mechanism based on enhanced international cooperation to implement a risk-based approach, whereby risks are quickly and appropriately identified as they evolve and responded to dynamically in accordance with their characteristics. A major effort should be undertaken to increase the monitoring of critical networks, and to assess and furnish remedies for any vulnerabilities that are identified. Measures should be taken to help developing countries improve their cyber defense programs through training and other necessary logistic support. Mechanisms should be developed for comprehensive military cooperation including cyber security deterrence strategies. As the United Nations (UN) has a significant and unique role in the international community, the organization can take action on a wide range of issues. An inclusive legal regime, institutional mechanisms, multilateral agreements and international military deterrence can be considered and discussed under the auspices of UN. Other international organizations, in particular, NATO, European Union, Council of Europe, G-8, OECD etc. can play a lead role in furtherance of international cyber security cooperation."}

The two countries also agreed to deepen their cooperation in a variety of areas including trade and investment, agriculture, water resources and cyber crime during extensive talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, who is on his first visit to India. Giving gist of his talks with the Israeli leader, Modi, in a media statement, said people of both countries were constantly threatened by forces of terrorism and extremism and both sides agreed to intensify cooperation in combating them effectively, particularly having practical and specific engagement such as in the cyber domain. We recognize that terrorism is a global challenge, knows no boundaries and has extensive links with other forms of organized crime, he said. In an obvious reference to Pakistan, the Prime Minister said, Regrettably, one of the countries of its origin and spread is in India's neighbourhood. We agreed that the international community must act with resolve and determination against terror networks and States that harbour them. Failure to act and silence of speech only encourages the terrorists, he said. Noting that Rivlin's visit has given a crucial push to efforts to build new pillars in bilateral ties, Modi said both sides noted the strength of the growing defence partnership and agreed on the need to make it more broad-based through production and manufacturing partnerships. India is Israel's largest buyer of military hardware and the latter has been supplying various weapons systems, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles over the last few years but the transactions have largely remained behind the curtains. The two sides inked two pacts to strengthen cooperation in agricuture and water resources management sectors.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who held talks with visiting Israeli President Reuven Rivlin here, said that engagement between India and Israel was multi-dimensional and wide-ranging. He said the two leaders deeply value their strong and growing partnership to secure their societies. Our people are constantly threatened by forces of terrorism and extremism. We recognize that terrorism is a global challenge, knows no boundaries and has extensive links with other forms of organized crime, Modi said in a joint briefing with the Israel president. Without naming Pakistan, Modi said Regrettably, one of the countries of its origin and spread is in India's neighbourhood. We agreed that the international community must act with resolve and determination against terror networks and states that harbour them. Failure to act and silence of speech only encourages the terrorists, he said. In his remarks, Rivlin said India and Israel stand together in defending their people and values against the threat of terror. Nothing can justify terror. Terror is terror, he said. Israel and India are threatened by terror because we uphold the values of freedom. We stand together in defending our people and values, Rivlin said. He also invited Modi to visit Israel. Earlier in the day, Rivlin was accorded a ceremonial reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Rivlin arrived in India on Monday on a week-long state visit -- the first by an Israeli President in nearly 20 years. Rivlin will visit Taj Mahal in Agra on Wednesday and also visit a water treatment plant in Sikandra. He is also scheduled to visit Chandigarh. In his remarks, Modi said the two countries agreed to broadbase their growing defence partnership. We agreed that the international community must act with resolve and determination against terror networks and states that harbour them. Failure to act and silence of speech only encourages the terrorists. We agreed to intensify our cooperation to combat the forces of extremism and radicalisation that threaten all peace-loving nations, he said. He said the two countries also prioritised practical and specific engagement such as in the cyber domain. Modi said Israeli companies can scale up their tie-ups with flagship schemes of Make in India, Digital India, Skill India and Smart Cities as the current trajectory of the Indian economy offered promising opportunities for them. He also said that the growing number of Indian students, going to study in Israel and the vice versa, can be an important bridge in the bilateral partnership. Two and a half decades of our friendship has brought rich dividends for both our nations. It has also strengthened voices of peace, stability and democracy globally, said Modi, pointing to the two countries celebrating 25 years of full diplomatic relations next year."}

After reaching out to West Asian countries such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Qatar over past two years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi government has now pulled ties with Israel out of the closet. At the bilateral meeting held on Tuesday between the visiting Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and Prime Minister Modi, the two countries decided to intensify cooperation to combat the forces of extremism and radicalisation. The decision came hours before the Union Cabinet decided to ban Islamic preacher Zakir Naik's organisation Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) for five years, under Unlawful Activity Prevention Act. Referring to growing collaboration between the two countries, particularly in defence sector, Rivlin, the first Israeli President to visit India in two decades, said his country is ready to make in India and make with India. He also asserted that nothing can justify terrorism. We stand together in defending our people and our values, he said after the conclusion of bilateral talks. Soon after Modi assumed office, foreign policy experts had expected him to go overboard to embrace Israel. But he stayed cautious and instead reached out to its Arab neighbours and Tel Aviv's arch rival Iran. Sources here said the strategy was carefully planned to remain sensitive to the Arab nations, especially at a time the Islamic State terror group was spreading across West Asia. India's abstention from a vote on a pro-Palestine resolution at the Unesco critical of Israel's construction within the walled city of Jerusalem in late October, just ahead of Rivlin's visit, seems second half of his term will see flurry visits of Israeli leaders. Modi's visit to Israel is also expected now in January 2017 to coincide with the celebrations of 25 years of full diplomatic relations between the two countries. In September 2015, President Pranab Mukherjee visited Israel, but he also travelled to Palestine and Jordan -- home to the world's largest number of Palestinian refugees. In January, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj also visited both Israel and Palestine. Both sides on Tuesday decided to broad-base defence partnership and also a variety of areas, including trade and investment, agriculture, water resources and cyber crime. Giving some details of his talks with the Israeli leader, Modi, in a media statement, said people of both countries were constantly threatened by forces of terrorism and extremism, and both sides agreed to intensify cooperation in combating them effectively, particularly having a practical and specific engagement such as in the cyber domain. We recognise that terrorism is a global challenge, knows no boundaries and has extensive links with other forms of organised crime, he said. In an obvious reference to Pakistan, the Prime Minister said, Regrettably, one of the countries of its (terror) origin and spread is in India's neighbourhood. Noting that Rivlin's visit has given a crucial push to efforts to build new pillars in bilateral ties, Modi said both sides noted the strength of the growing defence partnership and agreed on the need to make it more broad-based through production and manufacturing partnerships.

{"id":178,"title":"President Reuven Rivlin discusses strengthening Israel-India ties on India visit","class":0,"body":" President Reuven Rivlin got to work right away on the first day of his state visit to India Tuesday, meeting with the country’s president and prime minister and discussing working together to combat terrorism and extremism. Following a welcome ceremony Tuesday morning at the official residence of Indian President Pranab Mukherjee, Rivlin and his wife, Nechama, continued on to the tomb of Mahatma Gandhi, the supreme leader of India’s independence movement, laid a wreath and sprinkled petals on the grave – an Indian tradition. Just over a year has passed since Mukherjee paid a historic state visit to Israel as the first president of India to set foot in the Holy Land since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries almost 25 years ago. Recalling that Gandhi had been one of the world’s great humanitarians, Rivlin, in signing the guest book, found an appropriate quote from the Bible that could well have been Gandhi’s motto, or that of any great humanitarian: ‘Love thy neighbor as thyself.’ Rivlin then proceeded to Hyderabad House for a working meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other high- ranking government officials. Rivlin and Modi witnessed the signing by representatives of their respective countries of cooperation agreements and memoranda of understanding in agriculture and the management of water resources. Israel and India already cooperate closely in the areas of defense and combating terrorism, but in talks between Rivlin and Modi, it was agreed to strengthen this cooperation even further. Following the meeting, Modi – in a brief address to his guests and the media – noted that this was Rivlin’s first visit to India and said it would give a crucial push to efforts to build new pillars in our partnership. He was also convinced that it would carry forward the momentum generated by the first ever visit of a president of India to Israel last year. Modi underscored that he and Rivlin deeply value the strong and growing partnership between their countries to secure their respective societies. Our people are constantly threatened by forces of terrorism and extremism, he said. We recognize that terrorism is a global challenge, knows no boundaries and has extensive links with other forms of organized crime, emphasizing that he and Rivlin were of one accord in urging the international community to act with resolve and determination against terrorist networks and the states that harbor them. Failure to act and silence of speech only encourages the terrorists, he said, adding: We agreed to intensify our cooperation to combat the forces of extremism and radicalization that threaten all peace-loving nations. We also prioritized practical and specific engagement such as in the cyber domain. We noted the strength of our growing defense partnership, and, agreed on the need to make it more broadbased through production and manufacturing partnerships. Rivlin declared that nothing can justify terrorism, saying: We stand together in defending our people and our values. Modi also voiced India’s appreciation for Israel’s clear support for India’s permanent candidature in a reformed UN Security Council. Aside from security issues, Modi listed the multi-dimensional and wide-ranging list of engagements between India and Israel including: enhancing agricultural productivity and efficiency; boosting research and innovation linkages; employing applications of science and technology for the benefit of both societies; forging strong trade links and investment ties; enhancing people- to-people ties through greater cultural and tourism linkages; and promoting educational exchanges. On Tuesday evening, Mukherjee hosted a state dinner in Rivlin’s honor, at which Rivlin in comparing Israel to India said that although Israel is small size, it is a giant in the sphere of innovation and knowledge. Drawing inspiration from the colors of the Indian national flag in which the saffron represents strength and courage, the white peace and truth, the green fertility and growth and the blue wheel in the center, the eternal cosmic law, Rivlin applied these virtues to Israel in reference to innovations such as advanced solar energy, water management and irrigation, and getting above average milk yields from cows as only small examples of Israel’s innovation which, overall, defies the imagination. Mukherjee, meanwhile, noted that both India and Israel had attained independence at more or less the same time and that Gandhi had believed that it was legitimate for the Jews to want a state of their own after what they had experienced in World War II. At the conclusion of the dinner, Rivlin presented Mukherjee with a copy of A.B. Joshua’s book The Return from India."}

It has been a series of diplomatic and personal victories for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, currently on his fourth visit to the US. His meeting with President Barack Obama on Tuesday - their seventh so far and perhaps their last since Obama retires in January - was done in a backdrop of major deals signed between the two countries. Today, on the last day of his US trip before he makes a brief stop in Mexico on his way back home, PM Modi will address a joint sitting of the US Congress, a rare honour for a visiting leader. India and the US inked eight agreements, including in the sphere of defence and energy cooperation, and counter-terrorism. Here are the highlights: NUCLEAR DEAL The civilian nuclear agreement signed between India and the US over a decade ago has finally borne fruit with the two sides deciding to start preparatory work on six nuclear power plants in India. Culminating a decade of partnership on civil nuclear issues, the leaders welcomed the start of preparatory work on site in India for six AP 1000 reactors to be built by Westinghouse and noted the intention of India and the US Export-Import Bank to work together toward a competitive financing package for the project, a joint statement issued following Tuesday's talks between the two leaders said. Once completed, the project would be among the largest of its kind, fulfilling the promise of the US-India civil nuclear agreement and demonstrating a shared commitment to meet India's growing energy needs while reducing reliance on fossil fuels, it said. The US-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation, also known as the 123 Agreement, was signed by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and then US President George W Bush on July 18, 2005. The AP 1000 is a nuclear power plant designed and sold by Westinghouse, a subsidiary of Japan's Toshiba. The US has also supported India's bid for the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). However, due to China's continuous opposition, India will still have to wait a bit longer to break into the elite 48-member club that regulates global nuclear trade. MAJOR DEFENCE PARTNER The US has recognised India as a major defence partner, a significant development which paves the way for the country to be treated at par with America's closest allies for defence related trade and technology transfer. Noting that the US-India defence relationship can be an anchor of stability and given the increasingly strengthened cooperation in defence, the United States hereby recognises India as a Major Defence Partner, said a joint statement issued after Modi held talks with Obama. According to the statement, under the 'Major Defence Partner' recognition, the US will continue to work toward facilitating technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners. Besides, officials from two sides said India and the US have finalised of the text of the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA). It is likely to be signed soon. India and the US also finalised text of an Information Exchange Annex under the Joint Working Group on Aircraft Carrier Technology Cooperation. COUNTER-TERRORISM A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the exchange of terrorist screening information between the Multi-Agency Centre/Intelligence Bureau of India and the Terrorist Screening Center of the US under which the two sides shall provide each other access to terrorism screening information through the designated contact points, subject to domestic laws and regulations. The arrangement will enhance the counter-terrorism cooperation between the two countries. CYBER SECURITY India and the US also stressed on cooperation on cyber issues, including to promote closer cooperation between their law enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime and also to share information on a real time on malicious cyber security threats and establish appropriate mechanisms to improve such information sharing. A fact sheet on the framework for the US-India Cyber Relationship says that cooperation on cyber issues is a key component of the bilateral relationship between India and the US. The two countries have also reached an understanding to finalise the Framework for the US-India Cyber Relationship. CLEAN ENERGY India and the US have announced the setting up of two financial assistance programmes worth $60 million for supporting India's much-needed clean energy initiatives, including solar power and other renewables. The United States is committed to bring to bear its technical capacity, resources and private sector, and is jointly launching with India new efforts, to spur greater investment in India's renewable energy sector, including efforts that can serve as a model for other ISA Member Countries, the White House said. This includes a creation of a $20 million US-India Clean Energy Finance initiative, equally supported by the United States and India. This is expected to mobilise up to $400 million to provide clean and renewable electricity to up to 1 million households by 2020. CLIMATE CHANGE The historic climate change agreement in Paris may not have been possible without the leadership shown by India in making some substantial commitments, the White House said after Modi's meeting with Obama. We've said on many occasions that India's role in that process was significant and it's unlikely that we would have actually reached an agreement in Paris last December had the Indians not stepped up and shown some leadership in making some substantial commitments, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. He made the remarks while responding to questions on the meeting between Obama and Modi wherein the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to join the Paris agreement by the end of this year."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":182,"title":"In boost to Paris climate pact, India says it aims to join this year","class":0,"body":"India has agreed to work toward joining the Paris Agreement on climate change this year, India and the United States said on Tuesday, giving a jolt of momentum to the international fight to curb global warming. At a time of heightened tensions in Asia over China's assertive pursuit of territory, the two countries also pledged to expand military cooperation and outlined principles for cooperation on cyber issues. President Barack Obama welcomed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House for their seventh meeting since Modi took office in 2014, underscoring the warm relationship between the leaders and the world's two largest democracies. Modi is to address the U.S. Congress on Wednesday. We discussed how we can, as quickly as possible, bring the Paris Agreement into force, Obama told reporters. Climate change is a legacy issue for the U.S. president who leaves office in January. India's potential entrance into the agreement this year would help accelerate its enactment, perhaps years ahead of schedule. India is the world’s third-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China and the United States. The two countries also welcomed preparations that could lead to the building of six nuclear reactors in India by U.S.-based Westinghouse, in what would be the culmination of some 10 years of work to resolve civil-nuclear issues. The joint statement said India and the U.S. Export-Import Bank were working to complete a financing package for the project and that the Nuclear Power Corporation of India and Westinghouse had confirmed engineering and site design work would begin immediately. It said Westinghouse and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India would work toward finalizing the contract by June 2017 - a year later than Westinghouse's chief executive, Daniel Roderick, said he hoped for in an interview with Reuters in late March. Modi told an event organized by the U.S. India Business Council that relations between India and the United States were closer than ever. He said the planned reactor purchases would mark new era in nuclear and scientific cooperation. Modi's address to a joint session of Congress will be a significant personal step. Although this has become an tradition for Indian prime ministers, he was once banned from the United States over massacres of Muslims. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in sectarian riots in Gujarat in 2002 when Modi had just become the state's chief minister. Modi has denied any wrongdoing, and India's Supreme Court in 2010 ruled there was no case. In the joint statement, the United States said it now recognized India as a Major Defense Partner and would work on technology sharing to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners. The text of a logistics agreement, which will allow the countries' militaries to use each other's land, air and naval bases, would be signed soon, a U.S. official said. Tensions between the United States and Pakistan as well as regional concerns about China have served as a backdrop to increased security cooperation. Senator John McCain, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, said the address to Congress was entirely appropriate given the new partnership. There’s no doubt there are significant tensions and challenges in the region, which argues for closer coordination between our militaries, he said. While Modi is generally popular with U.S. lawmakers, they criticize what they see as lingering unfriendliness to U.S. firms and a stifling bureaucracy, in spite of Modi's pro-business image. They also question New Delhi's record on human rights. Modi got a boost on Tuesday when Amazon Inc AMZN.O Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said his company would invest an additional $3 billion in India, boosting its committed investment in the country to over $5 billion. Obama and Modi agreed to work together on an ambitious amendment to an international pact known as the Montreal Protocol to reduce hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, a particularly potent greenhouse gas. The two countries said India would take steps to join the Paris agreement this year. India and the United States recognize the urgency of climate change and share the goal of enabling entry into force of the Paris Agreement as early as possible, the joint statement said. The United States reaffirms its commitment to join the agreement as soon as possible this year. India similarly has begun its processes to work toward this shared objective. The agreement, forged in 2015, will take effect when at least 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions ratify it. By late last month 17 small countries had ratified it, according to the United Nations, and many others including the United States and China have pledged to do so in 2016. Environmental groups had hoped Modi would say that India was ready to ratify the agreement during his Washington trip. With India now on board, a growing chorus of countries are seeking to bring the Paris Agreement into full effect as soon as possible, Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, said in a statement."}

The document, issued at the end of talks between US President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on his fourth visit to the US in less than two years, also lays out a road map for broad-ranging India-US collaboration in areas such as defence, trade and cyber security. According to the statement, India and the US pledged to pursue new opportunities to bolster economic growth and sustainable development, promote peace and security at home and around the world, strengthen inclusive, democratic governance and respect for universal human rights, and provide global leadership on issues of shared interest. Obama and Modi noted the increasing convergence in the strategic perspectives of India and the US and emphasized the need to remain closely invested in each other’s security and prosperity, the statement said. On India’s entry into exclusive non-proliferation groups and regimes, the statement said India and the US looked forward to India’s imminent admission into the Missile Technology Control Regime. President Obama welcomed India’s application to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)... The United States called on NSG participating governments to support India’s application when it comes up at the NSG plenary later this month, it said. In the area of nuclear power production, Obama and Modi welcomed the start of preparatory work for six reactors to be built by Westinghouse Electric Co. in Andhra Pradesh. India and the US Export-Import Bank are to work together on a financing package for the project, the statement said.

Acknowledging India’s role in the accord agreed to at the Paris climate change talks in November, it said the US was committed to supporting India’s renewable energy programme and was working to spur greater investment in the area. Together, the two countries announced the creation of a $20 million US-India Clean Energy Finance (USICEF) initiative, equally supported by the US and India, which is expected to mobilize up to $400 million to provide clean and renewable electricity to up to 1 million households by 2020. The statement also said that Modi and Obama resolved that the United States and India should look to each other as priority partners in the Asia-Pacific and the Indian Ocean region. In maritime security, India and the US called for ensuring the freedom of navigation and overflight and exploitation of resources as per international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and settlement of territorial disputes by peaceful means. This oblique reference is aimed at China which is locked in maritime disputes with its smaller South East Asian neighbours in the South China Sea. China claims the entire South China Sea as its exclusive domain and has imposed flight restrictions and embargoed maritime routes through the disputed area. In the area of defence cooperation, which can be an anchor of stability, the statement said the US hereby recognizes India as a major defence partner. The joint statement said India and the US would explore agreements which would facilitate further expansion of bilateral defence cooperation in practical ways. In this regard, they welcomed the finalization of the text of the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement, which would allow the two countries to provide logistics support, refuelling and berthing facilities for each other’s warships and aircraft. The US will continue to work toward facilitating technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners. The leaders reached an understanding under which India would receive licence-free access to a wide range of dual-use technologies in conjunction with steps that India has committed to take to advance its export control objectives, the statement said. In a boost for Modi’s Make in India programme, the US would support the Indian initiative to develop defence industries through the export of goods and technologies consistent with US law. In the area of cyber security, Obama and Modi said they would deepen cooperation and were committed to enhancing cyber collaboration on critical infrastructure, cyber crime, and malicious cyber activity by state and non-state actors. On terrorism, Obama and Modi condemned the recent terrorist incidents from Paris to Pathankot, from Brussels to Kabul and resolved to redouble their efforts, bilaterally and with other like-minded countries, to bring to justice the perpetrators of terrorism anywhere in the world and the infrastructure that supports them. The two countries pledged to work together to combat terrorist threats from extremist groups such as Al Qaida, Da’esh/ISIL (Islamic State), the Pakistan based Jaish-e Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba, besides Indian gangster Dawood Ibrahim and his group and their affiliates including through deepened collaboration on UN terrorist designations.The two countries have finalised an arrangement to facilitate the sharing of terrorist-screening information and called for Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai and 2016 Pathankot terrorist attacks to justice, the statement said.To boost trade, India and the US resolved to break down barriers to the movement of goods and services, and support deeper integration into global supply chains, thereby creating jobs and generating prosperity in both economies, the statement said. The two leaders agreed to facilitate the freer movement of people of both countries.

Malicious cyberactivities have been affecting individuals, private entities, government institutions and non-governmental organizations for years. We have witnessed large-scale cyber-incidents such as in Estonia in 2007, with numerous sophisticated targeted attacks, hacktivism and countless instances of identity theft and malware. Due to the unpredictable nature of cyberthreats, an incident that may appear in the beginning as an act of hacktivism or financially motivated cybercrime may rapidly escalate into something much more serious and reach the threshold of national security, even cyberwar. Despite the lack of consensus on exactly what constitutes cyberwarfare or cyberterrorism, governments need to ensure that their infrastructure is well protected against different types of cyberthreats and that their legal and policy frameworks would allow to effectively prevent, deter, defend and mitigate possible cyberattacks. Not being able to agree on common definitions of central terms such as cyberattack and cyberwar should not prevent states from expressing the urgency of preparing their nations for possible cyberincidents. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION The logic of international cooperation and collaboration lies on why, when, and how to collaborate, and generally takes place in order to follow one’s interests or to manage common aversions. 1 In the context of cybersecurity, the need for international cooperation between states, international and regional organizations and other entities is emphasized by the borderless and increasingly sophisticated nature of cyberthreats. Principally, any actor, whether it is a country or a non-governmental organization, following its objectives in cybersecurity requires cooperation from a wide range of international partners. In fact, much of the international collaboration will occur outside specific national frameworks, emphasizing the Whole of System approach that stresses the need to take into account all relevant stakeholders.2 Thus, from a national perspective, advancements in cybersecurity depend to a large extent on the political will of different actors. Areas such as information and intelligence sharing and mutual assistance may become essential in responding to a cybercrisis, but the effectiveness of such cooperation depends greatly upon strategically aligned policy goals and bilateral and multilateral relations. In many domains, such as international criminal cooperation, there are several preconditions that need to be in place in the cooperating countries, such as substantive national law as well as procedural law and international agreements, before the dialogue on the possibility of any sort of international cooperation can grow into further discussions on the efficiency of such cooperation. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVE IN CYBERSECURITY National policies, international agreements as well as other initiatives addressing cybersecurity that are being proposed and launched by different international, regional and national actors may vary considerably in their scope, aim and success, but they all underline the international dimension of cyberspace. For example, the United Nations First Committee has been actively examining the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security for years. The African Union has published the Draft African Union Convention on the Establishment of a Credible Legal Framework for Cyber Security in Africa. The European Union (EU) has recently published a Joint Communication on the Cyber Security Strategy of the European Union, which is the first attempt for a comprehensive EU policy document in this domain to reflect the common view on cybersecurity of all its 27 member states. Even though in recent years the wider debate has intensified on the development of possible norms of behaviour or a set of confidence-building measures in the cybersecurity domain, it should not be forgotten that most of the pressing issues and challenges in areas related to cybersecurity have roots in the adoption and review of national legislation and the implementation of multilaterally agreed principles. PRINCIPLE DEVELOPMENTS The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE) is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) accredited international military organization that focuses on a range of aspects related to cybersecurity, such as education, analyses, consultation, lessons learned, research and development. Even though the Centre does not belong to the direct command line of NATO, its mission is to enhance the capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, NATO nations and partners in cyberdefence. Determined that international cooperation is key to the successful mitigation of cyberthreats worldwide, the Centre invests not only in broader collaboration with NATO and EU entities but, more specifically, focuses on improving practical cooperation within and among its sponsoring nations by hosting a real time network defence exercise known as Locked Shields. It also participates in many other similar simulations, thereby allowing the participants to put national coordination and cooperation frameworks to practise, and to learn and test the skills needed to fend off a real attack. Regarding the legal and policy aspects of cybersecurity, NATO CCD COE has identified two main trends. Firstly, a growing number of countries are adopting national cybersecurity strategies and the majority of these documents confirm the role of cybersecurity as a national security priority. To further analyse such a development and the concept of national cybersecurity strategies, the Centre has conducted a comparative study called the National Cyber Security Framework Manual. The research asserts that a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy needs to take into account a number of national stakeholders with various responsibilities in ensuring national cybersecurity. The national stakeholders include critical infrastructure providers, law enforcement agencies, international organizations, computer emergency response teams and entities ensuring internal and external security. Importantly, instead of viewing cybersecurity as a combination of segregated areas or isolated stakeholders, the activities of different subdomains and areas of competence should be coordinated. Secondly, there are ongoing discussions about the applicability of international law to cyberactivities. Whereas it is widely accepted that cyberspace needs to be protected like air, sea and land, and is clearly defined by NATO Strategic Concept as a threat that can possibly reach a threshold setting threatening national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security and stability, there are only a few international agreements that would directly address behaviour in cyberspace. Agreeing on a common stance even in matters regarding well-established norms of customary international law, such as the prohibition of the use of force codified in the United Nations Charter, Article 2(4), together with the two exceptions of self-defence and a resolution by the Security Council, in the context of their applicability to the cyberdomain remains a challenging task for the involved parties. Therefore, amid the complex legal issues surrounding these debates, in 2009 NATO CCD COE invited an independent International Group of Experts to examine whether existing international law applies to issues regarding cybersecurity and, if so, to what extent. The result of this three-year project, the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, focuses on the jus ad bellum, the international law governing the resort to force by states as an instrument of their national policy, and the jus in bello, the international law regulating the conduct of armed conflict. The experts taking part in the project concluded that, in principle, jus ad bellum and jus in bello do apply in the cyber context but this may be altered by state practice. This and other opinions expressed in the Tallinn Manual should not be considered as an official declaration of any state or organization, but rather as the interpretation of the group of individual international experts acting solely in their personal capacity. The Manual does not, however, address cyberactivities that occur below the threshold of a use of force, and for that purpose NATO CCD COE has launched a follow-on three-year project entitled Tallinn 2.0. In order to prepare nations for possible cyberincidents and ensure a solid ground for international cooperation, both comprehensive national cybersecurity strategies and a common understanding on the applicability of the international law are required. Even though it has been argued that multilateral treaties are the most practical vehicles for harmonizing national legal systems and aligning the interpretation of existing international law, discussions about moving towards such an agreement on a global level appear to be at a very early stage. Given the current normative ambiguity surrounding international law in the context of cybersecurity, international cooperation between different actors is deemed to be the cornerstone of effective responses to cyberthreats."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":185,"title":"China-Russia Cybersecurity Cooperation: Working Towards Cyber-Sovereignty","class":0,"body":"Since 2014, closer ties between China and Russia have attracted speculation about whether the relationship will continue to deepen into an alliance. The 2015 Sino-Russian cybersecurity deal seemed to mark further Sino-Russian cooperation another arena—cyberspace. The pact has two key features: mutual assurance on non-aggression in cyberspace and language advocating cyber-sovereignty. If this pact is merely treated as a non-aggression pact, then Sino-Russian cybersecurity cooperation has a similar pattern to their overall relationship, which appears to be intimate but is actually problematic. However, looking past the non-aggression elements of the pact illuminates the key element of the agreement—China and Russia’s pronounced support for the concept of cyber-sovereignty. The support for cyber-sovereignty echoes the centerpiece of Sino-Russian cooperation in the general terms—a challenge to US dominance in the international system. Background Since the Russian Federation’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Sino-Russian relations have grown closer. For instance, energy cooperation between China and Russia advanced and a 30-year gasoline deal was finally signed. Additionally, the announcement of the contract for the S-400 Triumph missile defense system and the transfer of Su-35 combat aircraft in 2015 marked a continuation of Russia’s arms sales to China, which had previously been halted for nearly 10 years. However, there is a lack of substance to Sino-Russian cooperation. The final price over the gas deal has remained a disputed issue and since oil prices have continued to plunge, China has been reluctant make the expected prepayment. Furthermore, although Russia has agreed to sell the S-400 air defense system to China—its most advanced air defense system—and China has made an advance payment, it is still unknown which type will be delivered, and whether Russia will actually deliver. According to an interview made by Russian News Agency TASS in March with Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov, as China has made advance payment, the defense system would be delivered in the first quarter of 2017; but in June, during the interview with Sputnik, Chemezov indicated that China will not receive S-400s earlier than 2018. As a result, instead of making substantial progress to bring their partnership to the next level, Russia and China are more likely working to appear cooperative as a signal to challenge the US defined world order. A similar pattern can also be observed in the realm of cybersecurity. Russia and China made a bilateral cybersecurity deal in May 2015, described by some media as a nonaggression pact. While the frame of the pact was largely borrowed from their previous agreement under the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the effectiveness of implementing their pledge not to hack each other remains questioned. The Limits of Sino-Russian Cybersecurity Cooperation According to the report published in September 2015 by Proofpoint.Inc, a U.S. based information security company, Chinese language based tools were used in a campaign targeting telecommunications and military in Russia from July-September 2015, only two months after the signing of the May 2015 cybersecurity pact. Although there is no evidence proving the attack has a direct linkage with any Chinese groups, the use of Chinese-language tools and the command-and–control that goes back to host sites in Chinese influence areas raises suspicions that the Chinese are the most likely actors. In contrast, Chinese espionage activities on US have declined since the US and China signed their cybersecurity deal in September 2015. However, cyber-espionage attacks by Chinese-speaking groups against Russian targets have increased 300 percent from December 2015 to February 2016, as indicated by Costin Raiu, a top security expert with Kaspersky Lab, an international software security group headquartered in Moscow. Therefore, it seems that the cybersecurity pact between Russia and China has actually brought little development to ensure their safety in cyberspace. Common Ground: Working Towards Cyber-Sovereignty Nevertheless, cyber-espionage is not the core of Sino-Russian cybersecurity cooperation. Much like Russia and China’s combined effort to oppose a US-dominated world order, the insistence on cyber-sovereignty is a shared strategic interest that contrasts with the US advocacy for cyber freedom. The Chinese idea of cyber-sovereignty was first mentioned in 2010 in a white paper called The Internet in China and was reinforced by Chinese President Xi at the 6th BRICS summit in 2014. It was further emphasized at the Wuzhen World Internet Conference in December 2015. China argues that Internet sovereignty should mean that the Internet is a reflection of physical space and, hence, also a state’s sovereign territory. Thus, according to China, the Internet should not be subjected to foreign interference, and each country should have the right to control its domestic cyberspace. In other words, any Internet regulation, such as state control over Internet content, is justified. In order to create this norm of cyber-sovereignty, China is working fervently to establish regulatory institutions and mechanisms to strengthen cyber-governance. Moreover, in support of the idea of cyber-sovereignty, China is looking for international partners that share the same ideology. For instance, the Cyber Security Association of China (CSAC), newly created in March 2016, not only connects the government, private sector, and researchers to centralize the state power over cyberspace, but also is an institution which for the first time can engage in international cyber diplomacy at more senior levels. The intention of engaging in international cyber-diplomacy is exemplified by CSAC’s participation in the cybersecurity forum in Moscow in June. Meanwhile, Russia’s concern with US control over the Internet and its own Internet governance has increased since the implementation of Western sanctions against Russia in 2014. In 2014, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov made a statement that indicated that Russia may take measures to prevent foreign interference in its Internet. His statement coincides with China’s idea of Internet sovereignty. With the consensus in Internet sovereignty, the language of protecting Internet sovereignty in cyberspace was added to the Sino-Russian cybersecurity pact as the new aspect of cooperation. Deepening Cybersecurity Cooperation: The Information and Communication Technologies Development and Security Forum The first Russia-China Information and Communication Technologies Development and Security Forum held in Moscow in April 2016 illustrates the deepening of Sino-Russian cyber-sovereignty cooperation. The April meeting was attended by 50 Chinese information technology experts and government officials from the CSAC, including Lu Wei, the senior executive official in charge of Chinese cybersecurity and Internet policy, and Fang Binxing, the architect of China’s Great Fire Wall. The main focus of this Sino-Russian cybersecurity forum was implementing Internet regulation and protecting cyber-sovereignty. In February prior to the meeting, the Russian Ministry of Communication was preparing a bill on state control of the Internet traffic in Russia, with proposals to improve the infrastructure for monitoring DNS and IP addresses, to control foreign communication channels and traffic exchange points, and to oblige operators to use only the exchange points registered with the state. Following the announcement of the draft of this bill in March, the Safe Internet League, which is the largest state backed Russian organization focusing on combatting dangerous online content, published an article revealing China’s successes in building infrastructure to block malicious traffic and in solving IPv4 address exhaustion, which seemed to foreshadow the forum in April. At the meeting, the Russian attendees echoed the concerns brought forward by Chinese delegates about US reluctance to share its sovereignty over today’s Internet, and aggressive media propaganda, meaning the incoming information from the West. Nationwide pre-filtering was also proposed to protect Russian digital sovereignty along with the spoken need for more Internet regulation to improve the quality of online content. As the forum was concluded, there appeared to be a call to stand against the efforts of some nations to usurp Internet ownership. Therefore, instead of augmenting the trust or preventing cyber-espionage between the two countries, the Sino-Russian cybersecurity cooperation a strategic move to challenge US dominance over the Internet. Conclusions Undoubtedly, bilateral ties between China and Russia have been strengthened in recent years, yet this partnership will hardly become an alliance. Rather, the Sino-Russian cooperation is a marriage of convenience. The closeness of China and Russia’s cybersecurity relationship is not dependent on their ties with each other, but is defined in relation to the US. Just as China and Russia advocate for multipolarity to challenge the perceived US’s unipolar world view and values, their cooperation in cyberspace demonstrates the same focus on the US. There is a concern about the US support for Internet freedom as a foreign policy priority, accompanied by the FBI and Pentagon’s insistence on the loyalty of the global, but US-based, technology companies to American interests. The fear for and the opposition to US dominance over the Internet brings China and Russia together. Their combined efforts and increased cooperation to filter the incoming foreign information illustrate their determination to reshape international politics and cybersecurity norms."}

Thank you all, let’s do business, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said. (source: PTI) Stressing that cyber warfare is a strategic challenge, the visiting Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Thursday said that his country and its defence industry were ready and committed to strengthening its cooperation with India to make a safer world. Introducing the heads of Israel’s defence industry, Rivlin said in a speech on Thursday, We did not seek to become experts in the field of defence, but through the struggle for our independence and our liberty, we learned how important it is to be able to defend ourselves, to fight our enemies, to fight terrorism. Today the battlefield is changing. Cyber warfare is no longer science fiction, it is a strategic challenge. In all these areas, Israel, and Israeli industry is ready and committed to strengthening this cooperation to make a safer world. Of course we are very grateful to our Indian partners for the way they work together with us in order to ensure a safe and secure world. He added, There is positive and growing cooperation between our countries in many areas of defence and security. We also face a common challenge in fighting terrorism and radicalism. I am here today to affirm our commitment to the fight against global terrorism. We are here today to carry the great potential of this partnership into reality. Rivlin is in India for an eight-day visit. After holding talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this week, he visited Agra and is scheduled to travel to Karnal, Chandigarh and Mumbai. Regarding cooperation across diverse sectors, he said, Israel wants to play a part in the Four-Colours Revolution that Prime Minister Modi has set as India’s national goal, that brings together the colours of the Indian flag: saffron for solar power, green for agriculture, white for dairy produce and blue for water. In all these issues, Israel — little Israel — is a giant of knowledge and experience, as we have already had to overcome our own challenges. Our advanced solar power systems, irrigation systems, water treatment projects and the average milk production per cow are just a few examples.Today’s innovations are almost unimaginable — and we now have companies working to make water out of air. We want to gather all these technologies, all the power of our Israeli innovations, as our motivation today: To make in India!! To make with India!! To be your partners! He said the two sides were cooperating to attain food security. We already have Israeli and Indian experts working together with local farmers to improve Indian produce and the lives of local families. We are very proud of all they are doing. Tomorrow, I will visit Karnal where Indians and Israelis are developing new kinds of cherry tomatoes (which is an Israeli invention). They are already ‘making in India’ a future together. Our two nations have changed the world before; it is time to do it again, together.

{"id":189,"title":"India Strengthens the Alliance of Cyber Democracies","class":0,"body":"[The] combined strength of cyber security experts in all organisations in the government domain is 556, which is grossly inadequate to handle cyber security activities. – India’s National Security Council Secretariat India’s agreement with Japan to cooperate on cybersecurity at the recent 22 of Secretaries of Defence and External Affairs of each country has a distinctly strategic and military connotation. The move represents a deepening of India’s strategic engagement with the global network of the alliance of democracies with the United States at the core. More specifically, it brings India a step closer to joining the inner circle of that alliance that is involved in signals intelligence and joint cyber defense of a military character. At the EastWest Institute’s Second Worldwide Cybersecurity Summit in London in 2011, Deputy National Security Adviser, Dr. Latha Reddy, declared that India wanted to become a member of the community of trusted nations in cyberspace. Some in London believe she meant by this the global intelligence alliance based on a small club of English speaking democracies who have been close intelligence allies since World War II (USA, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand). The intelligence alliance is now much bigger in practical terms and includes other countries (such as Japan, South Korea, Israel or Taiwan) according to the military problem. If this is the direction that India is heading, then such a development would only be a positive one for global cyber stability. China will be watching this closely. The moves do not involve hostile intent toward China, but they demonstrate the increasing power of the alliance of cyber democracies in a situation of growing mistrust of China, caused by events in the cyber domain inside China and by its steadily accumulating military power. Although a cyber alliance for military operations is far more complex than for conventional operations, China is already heavily outgunned in cyberspace by the combined power of key members of the alliance of democracies. Little detail is available yet on what path the cybersecurity cooperation between India and Japan will take, as it will be discussed at a meeting on 5 November. But the scope of India’s existing or planned defense cooperation with Japan gives some hints. This cooperation involves: strategic consultations on freedom of the seas, cooperation in anti-piracy operations, peacekeeping consultations, planning for a trilateral exercise with the United States, staff talks between the ground forces, staff exchanges between air forces and navies, planned mutual visits of vessels and aircraft, and a bilateral naval exercise. Indian cooperation with Japan on military strategic aspects of cybersecurity will relate mostly to protecting common security interests – keeping cyberspace open for business and maintaining international confidence in it. The United States and Japan have conducted joint cyber exercises at the civilian level, involving the Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) of the two countries and this may be one path that cyber cooperation between India and Japan takes. The agreement on cybersecurity with Japan is very much in line with the quickening pace of Indian policy development in this area, represented most recently by the release on 15 October of the Recommendations of Joint Working Group on Engagement with Private Sector on Cyber Security, which included references to increased international efforts by India to enhance its national cybersecurity. This report made plain that cybersecurity for India cannot be delivered by the government alone, but that an active and robust alliance with the private sector is essential. What the paper did not say explicitly, but which is fundamentally true for all countries, is that cybersecurity depends on a global network of private sector actors working together, not just nationally branded companies. So national security in the information age is a responsibility now shared with non-national corporations. This inevitably means that in spite of India’s traditions of non-alignment and independent action, the realities of cyberspace are pushing it in a new direction of alliance building and dependence on others for its basic security."}

Navy Adm. Mike S. Rogers, commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency. NSA photo Navy Adm. Mike S. Rogers, who is also director of the National Security Agency, spoke during the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council annual meeting on the fight for global security in an era of borderless wars. On the government’s ability to help industry during major cyberattacks, Rogers said it’s unrealistic to expect the private sector alone to withstand the onslaught of activity that is being directed against them by nation-states and other actors. Likewise, the admiral added, I don't think it's realistic to say the government's just going to do this [by itself] because the challenge with the government doing it is, if you want me to defend something I can't … defend a network if I ... don't have access to that network structure, a level of outside access the private sector has resisted. Critical Success An exception to this was Sony Corporation after a 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack of confidential data sponsored by North Korea. Rogers said that a positive aspect of the hack was great collaboration among a private company, the private-sector computer network expertise that Sony brought in and federal agencies. They knew they were dealing with something [after the hack] so they went out and hired expertise and capability from within the private sector, the admiral said. They then came to the conclusion that this was something bigger than they had initially thought so they reached out to the government. I give them big kudos for that. Sony officials were very up front when they approached the government, he added, saying they asked for help to understand what happened and to make sure it didn’t happen again.

Navy photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Jesse A. Hyatt Providing Value We said, if you want us to provide value and insight we need full access to your network and your data, Rogers recalled, adding, They had no issue at all, just insure that you inform us of what you're doing, why you're doing it and exactly what you're doing and you stick to that. It worked out great, Rogers said, and there was good information flow between Sony and the U.S. government response team, which consisted mainly of Cybercom, NSA, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. One of the reasons why the partnership is so important -- using NSA resources to monitor and guard U.S. networks -- that's not our mission, Rogers said in March 2015 in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on cyber operations, and it's against the law … but on the other hand, I do want to create a partnership where we're able to share information with each other. The FBI was designated as the lead agency, Rogers said, and the FBI turns to NSA and says, ‘We could use your analytic help, will you partner with us in working with Sony?’ The admiral said Sony cooperated completely with the government during the investigation. Significant Calamity Rogers said that as director of NSA and commander of Cybercom, the agreement he always reaches with whoever they’re working with is that neither agency will use the data they gain for anything other than the exact purpose they’ve discussed. I don't want it to get to the point where it takes some significant calamity to drive us to the conclusion that we've got to do something different than what we're doing now, the admiral added. During Rogers’ remarks, the audience of chief executive officers participated an instant poll was taken on the question: Do you trust the government enough with your information to work with it during a cyberattack? The choices were: a) absolutely, b) only if my company is attacked, or c) never. The result was that 56 percent said they absolutely trusted the government enough to work with them, 34 percent said only if their company was attacked, and 9 percent said never. For Rogers, this was a positive result. Overall that's pretty good, he said. Less than 10 percent of you said that there were no circumstances under which [you] would consider doing this. From my perspective that's a broad positive -- that means there's a willingness among 91 percent of you to have some form of dialog and to potentially look at [partnering with the government on cybersecurity] as a possibility."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":195,"title":" Rivlin to look into increasing flights to Southeast Asian country ","class":0,"body":" president Reuven Rivlin was surprised to learn on Monday that despite the strong bilateral effort to enhance relations between Israel and India at all levels, El Al flies there only three times a week. The information was imparted to him by Jamshyd N. Godrej, a co-chair of the India-Israel Forum, which is convening this week in Israel. The forum, which was founded eight years ago under the auspices of Tel Aviv University, focuses on international economic and financial trends and their impact on the economies of the two countries. It convenes annually, alternating between Israel and India. Godrej told Rivlin that members of the forum would like to see an improvement in flights to India. There is a great need for better connectivity, he said. Rivlin promised that he would speak to the relevant government authorities, with a view to increasing the flights. Dedicated to the enhancement of political, economic and defense relations between Israel and India, the forum, which is supported by several charitable trusts, is made up of policy-makers, captains of industry, academics and diplomats. It is a joint endeavor of TAU and Aspen Institute India and the Confederation of Indian Industry. The forum has grown in strength over the past eight years, Godrej said, adding that discussions during its current meeting in Israel have centered on geopolitics and how to make progress in different areas of trade. Not counting the deep ties in defense technology and appliances, he said that diamonds still made up the bulk of the trade between the two countries. In addition to attending the joint meetings, Indian visitors also met with Israeli counterparts on issues that included energy, environment, water, agriculture, space exploration, financial services, media, automobiles, electricity, politics, diplomacy and cyber security. At their meeting with Rivlin, they commented that this past year had been one of visibility – which is very important to the relationship between the two countries – and a good time for harvesting opportunities. They also made the point that India is very keen to have Israeli products made in India. Rivlin replied that in the early days of the state, Dov Yosef, whose various cabinet portfolios included trade and industry, hammered home the importance of the Made in Israel trademark. One of the Indians responded: We call it ‘Make in India,’ not ‘Made in India.’ Two of the leading figures of Reliance Industries India said they were exploring opportunities that went beyond joint ventures with Israeli companies, including agreements with educational institutions for use of their research. The two said they believed that Israel could also be a partner in building India’s new infrastructure. Although India’s educational institutions are of a very high standard, Indian students would like to come to Israel to study, Rivlin was told. He was also told that despite the difference in populations, the number of start-ups in India was more or less equal to that in Israel. One of the problems in working together is that of cultural differences. Whereas Israelis are always in a hurry, Indians tend to take things slowly. Sometimes, walking a little slower means getting to the task faster, Rivlin said. Stanley Bergman, a New York-based co-chairman of the forum, spoke of the importance of collaboration and dialogue. He said there has been a lot of collaborative work in security and cyber technology, as well as a lot of discussion on getting incubator technologies from the university to the market. Rivlin pointed out that cyber research and development were no less important in civilian life than in the military. He cited banks as a prime example. Prof. Joseph Klafter, president of Tel Aviv University, noted that TAU had been a catalyst for relations between the two countries and was now building bridges beyond academia. He said he was very proud of the university’s role in the relationship. In welcoming the forum, Rivlin spoke of his forthcoming state visit to India at the invitation of President Pranab Mukherjee, who was in Israel two weeks ago. He will be accompanied by a large business delegation, and emphasized the need for the two countries to work together on issues such as food production, water conservation and innovation."}

Amos J.

President-elect Donald Trump has promised to revive coal mining in the U.S. and leave the Paris climate agreement. Very little will change. Coal is not coming back in the U.S. regardless of what Republicans say, Mr. Hochstein said. Coal will remain a major part of India’s energy mix, which is true when Obama is President, which will be true when Donald Trump will be President. But it was not President Obama who set the target of 175 GW of renewable energy for India, it was PM Modi. I don’t see that changing, he said. People are not using coal not only because they are concerned about climate change, but also because of the same reason why they don’t use VCRs any longer, he said, speaking at the launch of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies-led U.S.-India State and Urban Initiative that aims at coordinating interactions between the two countries. There is tremendous demand but no natural way of accessing them. Because there is not one India, there are many States and other regional factors.

The two leaders held a bilateral meeting on Saturday, during which Xi also said the U.S.-China relationship is at a hinge moment, while not mentioning President-elect Donald Trump by name, according to Japan's Jiji Press. Obama and Xi have had longstanding differences with regards to issues such as China's controversial claims to territory in the South China Sea. But on North Korea the two leaders once again agreed they should work together to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, according to the report. International sanctions against Pyongyang after its fourth nuclear test in January 2016 were adopted in March with cooperation from Beijing, but a new resolution that could punish Pyongyang for its fifth nuclear test in September has yet to be adopted. During the APEC talks, and what is his ninth and last meeting with Xi, Obama requested China to more strictly implement current sanctions, and cooperate on new embargoes, according to Jiji. The two sides also emphasized the progress that was made during Obama's term in office, including cooperation on the Iran nuclear deal and an agreement to tackle climate change. While referring to the end of Obama's term in office, Xi said bilateral relations appear to be at a hinge moment, and that China seeks to cooperate with the United States in order to implement ties smoothly. The meeting comes at a time when South Korean officials continue to hold discussions with experts close to Trump or his transition team. On Sunday, South Korea's Deputy National Security Adviser Cho Tae-yong returned to Seoul, and told reporters that after meeting with U.S. advisors he expects a tougher North Korea policy under a Trump administration, according to Yonhap. Cho and the South Korean delegation met with former U.S. Ambassador John Bolton, Edwin J.

{"id":199,"title":" Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation should be deepened on multiple levels ","class":0,"body":" The following editorial appears in Sunday's Yomiuri Shimbun: It is hoped that defense cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will be steadily deepened in consideration of China's maritime advancement in the South and East China seas. A meeting of defense ministers from Japan and ASEAN countries has been held in Laos - the first of its kind to take place in two years, marking the second time such a gathering has been held. Defense Minister Tomomi Inada announced a comprehensive package of support measures, the pillar of which included those aiming to secure the thorough observance of the rule of law in the sea and the air, as well as to promote capacity building for the military of each ASEAN nation. The measures also seek to provide defense equipment and technical cooperation, while continuing to promote joint training, personnel development and other plans, as in the past. Newly added steps are aimed at undertaking to build cyberdefenses and dispose of landmines and unexploded bombs. It is important to appropriately grasp the diverse needs and problems of the ASEAN member nations, and then make strategic efforts in this respect. In response to enhanced cooperation due to the establishment of the ASEAN Community in December last year, multitiered assistance covering more than one country will also be extended in addition to past separate defense cooperation for each nation. The move seeks to widen the scope of training for specialists by Japan and equipment-related cooperation to cover more than one nation, thereby enabling countries involved to share information and technology. Doing so will promote efforts to boost the capability of ASEAN as a whole and strengthen its members' unity. These aims can be viewed as reasonable. In around 1990, Japan started defense exchanges with ASEAN nations, and our nation has been promoting separate defense cooperation with each member of the association since around 2000. A case in point is detailed technical guidance provided by Self-Defense Forces personnel on such matters as those related to disaster relief activities and the construction and improvement of facilities. These efforts have been held in high esteem. It is desired that efforts will be made to further improve the quality of defense cooperation now and beyond. In reference to the court of arbitration ruling that rejected China's claim to sovereignty rights in the South China Sea, Inada said, (The ruling) constitutes final judgment binding upon parties (to the case), and it's important to settle (the issue) based on this. She reportedly agreed with the ASEAN defense ministers regarding the necessity of securing the rule of law and resolving disputes in a peaceful manner. This will serve as an indirect restraint on China. In recent years, meanwhile, China has also been seeking to increase its provision of weapons and other assistance to ASEAN nations. It is said that Thailand intends to buy submarines from China. There are differences in the degree of interest with respect to the stances adopted by Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines in dealing with China, with the former two countries receiving a massive amount of economic assistance from China and the latter two locked in territorial disputes in the South China Sea with the nation. There is no doubt that the ASEAN members have a desire to obtain assistance, with their eyes on both Japan and China to size up their respective moves. Preserving the principle regarding the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea is indispensable for Japan's efforts to secure the safety of sea lanes. To prevent this situation from affecting the Chinese military's activities in the East China Sea, efforts should be made to proactively promote cooperation with ASEAN. In facilitating such cooperation, it is important for Japan to closely coordinate with the United States and decide what kind of role each should assume in this respect, despite uncertainties about the intentions of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump."}

The automakers are discussing joint manufacturing of small vehicles for emerging markets. Globally, we expect to see more growth coming in the compact car, or A and B, segments, Mitsui said this month here at an event to launch a Daihatsu-developed compact minivan being sold under the Daihatsu and Toyota brands in Japan. By strengthening cooperation, both companies hope to grab a bigger slice of the compact and minicar segments in fast-growing developing economies, Mitsui said. The compact minivan, sold as the Daihatsu Thor, Toyota Tank and Toyota Roomy, is the latest collaboration in a partnership dating to 1967 when Toyota struck a business tie-up with Daihatsu. Toyota made Daihatsu a wholly owned subsidiary in August and established a unit in which both companies will jointly develop small cars for emerging markets. We feel that Toyota appreciates us, Mitsui said. He said deeper ties with Toyota will enable Daihatsu to fully tap its strength in small car development. Both companies aim to accelerate the pace of cooperation, he added. Daihatsu is developing a global platform dubbed the Daihatsu New Global Architecture, or DNGA. The name is a take on the Toyota New Global Architecture, or TNGA, being rolled out by its giant parent company. Mitsui said the companies are forming a plan about what models to launch in which regions, as well as timelines for the introductions, but it will take some more time before we announce such decisions."}

The Senate has asked the High Court to investigate the eligibility of Senator Culleton, and former Family First senator Bob Day, with the directions hearing set for next Monday. Senator Culleton previously said he would not attend because the Senate is sitting next week, but has told 7.30 he has changed his mind. That's just changed in the last 10 minutes before coming to the studio, Senator Culleton said. I just got the submissions from the government solicitors and at one stage I thought I'd be just wrestling with smoke down there, but it's important that I go down to make sure that all the dates line up because they're trying to express run it prior to Christmas. Senator Culleton said he still planned to represent himself in court and thought it was a positive move to attend in person. Now that I've finally got the submissions, only a couple of days before the hearing date, I think it's a positive move to go down there on Monday. The Federal Government wants Senator Culleton's election investigated because he had been convicted of an offence carrying a jail term of one year or more at the time of the July 2 poll. That may make him ineligible to sit in the Upper House, even though the conviction has since been quashed. The challenge against Mr Day relates to a possible financial interest he had in his Adelaide electoral office and whether it breached the pecuniary interest rules for parliamentarians."}

Fifty-one representatives of predominantly Muslim states decided to address a letter to the U.N. on behalf of the O.I.C.’s executive committee during an emergency meeting held in Mecca. They wanted to take to necessary international measures to prevent the recurrence of such attacks against Mecca and other holy sites by rebel groups.m-k The attack took place on October 27 when Houthi militants fired a ballistic missile on Mecca. The missile was intercepted by Saudi Arabia’s defense system 65 kilometers from the city; Arab coalition forces later found and destroyed the rocket launchers. Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Nizar Madani condemned the attempted attack during the announcement of the U.N. referral. All Muslims must take a clear and strict stance against this attack to prevent Houthis from being encouraged to repeat this attempt, he said. The delegates present at the O.I.C. meeting also approved the creation of a work group of O.I.C. member states that would create and implement measures to avoid repeat attacks. The attack on Mecca was almost universally condemend by Muslim countries, as Mecca is a holy site for the world’s 1.5 billion Muslims. The announcement by the O.I.C. referred to Mecca as thecradle of revelation and said the attack was towards the direction of Muslims.macca-4 The condemnation of the attack and of those countries who back Houthi and Saleh militiamen in Yemen was implicitly aimed at Iran, one of the few Muslim countries not present at the meeting. The Iranian government, who officially deny their support for rebel forces in Yemen, declined an invitation to attend the meeting on Wednesday. According to sources who spoke to Asharq  al-Awsast, Iran’s supporting role for Houthi militias is now obvious to all Islamic states. Recently, Iran has increased its shipments of weapons to Yemen through land routes in Oman. Rebel attacks against Western vessels have also been linked to weapons provided by Iran. In particular, the use of Soviet-era Scud missiles, of which Iran still possesses stockpiles, have been considered damning evidence of Iranian support. The U.S., who recently intercepted an attempted attack by Houthi rebels while sailing in Yemeni waters, has claimed that its military has intercepted several shipments of weapons headed to Yemen by sea from Iran since 2015. Madani called for an end to the aggressive actions toward the Yemeni people by the Houthi rebels and militias loyal to ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh. At the same meeting, the O.I.C. elected Yusuf bin Ahem AL-Othaimeen as its new Secretary-General. Saudi Arabia proposed Othaimeen for the role after the previous Secretary-General, Iyad Ameen Madani, resigned for health reasons. Othaimeen, who was  pledged to bolster unified action amongst Muslim countries, was previously Minister of Social Affairs for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He was also Secretary-General for King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz’ Foundation for Housing Development and General Manager of the Charity Committee for Orphans’ Care (Ensign) in Riyadh."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":204,"title":" Canadian meeting with Saudi human rights commission draws criticism ","class":0,"body":" The Saudi Arabian flag flew on Parliament Hill on Wednesday as Canadian public officials met with a state-backed human rights commission from the Mideast country, a controversial body that publicly supported the Islamic kingdom's mass executions in January, 2016. Human-rights advocates say they fear that treating the Saudi Arabian Human Rights Commission as a serious watchdog plays into the Riyadh government's efforts to bolster its reputation at a time when it is accused of violating international humanitarian law with aerial bombing in Yemen, locking up dissidents and discriminating against women and religious minorities. Story continues below advertisement Canada's relationship with Saudi Arabia has come under intense scrutiny in the past 18 months over a $15-billion deal to sell weaponized armoured vehicles to the kingdom, which has an abysmal human-rights record. The country's chief envoy to Canada earlier this year called the contract a goodwill gesture to cement friendship between Riyadh and Ottawa. On Jan. 2, 2016, mass executions in Saudi Arabia – the largest in decades – killed 47, including Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a dissident cleric critical of the House of Saud. Governments around the world, including Canada's, condemned the actions. The Saudi Human Rights Commission was quick to affirm the executions. In a statement issued by the state-controlled Saudi Press Agency, it said the verdicts enforce justice, fulfill … legitimate and legal requirements, and protect the society and its security and stability. The head of the commission, Bandar Bin Mohammed Al-Aiban, made courtesy calls this week to Commons Speaker Geoff Regan and Senate speaker George Furey, but also met with Conservative foreign affairs critic Peter Kent. The green-and-white Saudi flag flew on the courtesy flag pole between Parliament's Centre Block and East Block – standard protocol – on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Wednesday, Mr. Al-Aiban met with International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, and with Patty Hajdu, Minister of Status of Women. The Canadian government said the pair would focus on the importance of women and girls as powerful agents for change. According to Freedom House, a U.S. democracy watchdog, in Saudi Arabia women are not treated as equal members of society, and many laws discriminate against them. They are not permitted to drive cars and must obtain permission from a male guardian in order to travel within or outside of the country. Foreign Affairs Minister Stéphane Dion's office said Mr. Dion would meet with Mr. Al-Aiban on Thursday and discuss a full range of human-rights issues, including Raif Badawi, a writer whose immediate family lives in Canada. In recent years, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for insulting Islam. That day, Mr. Al-Aiban will also be the special guest at a roundtable on human rights in Ottawa. It is not clear the Saudi body will take a deep interest in Mr. Badawi. The U.S. State Department said in a 2015 report that the Saudi rights commission focuses on less politically sensitive areas such as child abuse, child marriage and prison conditions, but avoided topics, such as protests or cases of political activists or reformists, that would require directly confronting government authorities. One human-rights watchdog said the Saudi human-rights commissioners are not necessarily the bad guys in the Saudi system – given their work on matters such as child abuse. But, Adam Coogle, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said they do seem to be more interested in burnishing Saudi Arabia's international image vis-à-vis human rights than actually advocating for necessary reforms. Mr. Dion said on Wednesday he is aware the Saudi commission supports the January mass executions. I am aware of all the difficulties and the trouble. It's an additional reason to engage – to try to make improvement, he said. Asked if he was concerned that working with the Saudi body would help legitimize a group criticized for its lack of independence from Riyadh, the minister said he feels it is better to talk than to shun them. To the contrary, I will never miss an opportunity to see how we may improve the situation for the Saudis regarding universal human rights, Mr. Dion said."}

Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news. Industry analysts and shipbrokers said an excess of light sweet crudes, has led to a surge in the number of Aframax tankers — which carry around 600,000 barrels — holding crude at sea. About 15 of these vessels, from off the coast of Scotland through to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, are depressing prices of regional crude grades, shipbrokers said. The demand is just not there, it’s becoming a recurring theme, said one shipbroker. He added that around three Aframax tankers is considered normal. These vessels are stacking up. An inability to sell the crude has led traders to factor in delays in discharging tankers loaded with crude. Shipbrokers have said delivery dates that are several weeks out are becoming a regular occurrence. The demand is just not there, it’s becoming a recurring theme … These vessels are stacking up The time-lag could suggest an inability to discharge at a port as land-based storage facilities are filling up, or that traders are seeking to make a profit from selling oil at a later date. Storing oil at sea as a trading strategy would normally utilise larger tankers. But the use of Aframax vessels may indicate a shorter-term, more opportunistic reaction to the surplus. Oversupply in the oil market has caused an important price spread, that is an indicator of the size of any surplus, to widen. The difference in the price of January and February Brent contracts rose to more than a $1 a barrel on Thursday. This is an unusually large change month-on-month. Weakness in the physical market could put pressure on the Opec cartel to trim production later this month as it seeks to implement a deal to ease the global surplus. Although prices reached a year high last month in the days after the Algeria deal, they have since eased by 12 per cent. Brent crude, the global benchmark, edged up by 35 cents to $46.98 a barrel on Thursday There is too much supply in the Atlantic basin and this is a trend we see continuing unless Opec does something about it. There is a need for a significant cut to supply. Even a production freeze wouldn’t be enough, said Eugene Lindell at JBC Energy consultancy. The cartel faces a tough task as its own members ramp up output to a record level while other producer nations — from Kazakhstan to Russia — are increasing supplies. Saudi Minister of Energy, Industrial and Mineral Resources Khalid al-Falih © AFP Opec agreed in Algeria in September to curb supplies from the group, with special conditions given to Libya, Nigeria and Iran, whose output has been hit by wars and sanctions. The details of the deal are expected to be ironed out when ministers meet in Vienna on November 30.Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, said he was keen the cartel reached a production target of 32.5m b/d to speed up the oil market’s recovery after a protracted downturn. This would imply a more than 1m b/d reduction from the group’s current output. Excess supplies in the Mediterranean are also making it more difficult to place North Sea barrels. Shipments from Kazakhstan’s Kashagan field have started driving exports of the light sweet crude, CPC Blend. Meanwhile Russia, already the world’s biggest exporter outside of Opec, is pumping 11m b/d and sending more crude into the region from its Filanovsky offshore oilfield. Separately, production of Libyan crude has more than doubled in recent weeks to around 600,000 b/d since the reopening of its eastern ports in September."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":206,"title":" Why Is Donald Trump Meeting With Foreign Leaders Already? Shinzo Abe Is Heading To The U.S.","class":0,"body":" On Thursday, President-Elect Donald Trump will reportedly meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in New York City. Although Trump has said that various world leaders called to introduce themselves in the wake of his election last week, Thursday's meeting with the Japanese delegation will be Trump's first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader since becoming president-elect. According to multiple reports, the purpose of the meeting will be to reassure the Japanese leader not to worry about Trump's often-harsh campaign rhetoric. During Trump's campaign, some of that rhetoric could have understandably concerned the Japanese administration. For instance, in August, Trump reportedly claimed that if the U.S. were attacked, Japan would sit home and watch Sony television. If we're attacked, Japan doesn't have to do anything. They can sit home and watch Sony television, OK Despite such rhetoric, Abe was reportedly eager to meet with the newly minted president-elect. It seemed clear that Trump's rhetoric would come up, but perhaps more importantly, the meeting served as a first glimpse into Trump's foreign policy. Since he won last week's general election over Hillary Clinton, Trump has proved unpredictable, weakening or going back on many of the things he wildly said during his campaign. For instance, although Trump had long vowed to repeal and replace President Obama's Affordable Care Act, he has since indicated that he may work to maintain some of its principles. In other words, Thursday's meeting with Abe wouldn't be the first time that Trump abandoned his bold campaign rhetoric for a more palatable approach.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 It doesn't seem often that a foreign leader comes to the U.S. not to meet with the president. But in the case of President-Elect Trump, there is a precedent. In 2008, then-President-Elect Obama reportedly met with nine world leaders, as well as a top intelligence officer for President George W. Bush, in the week following his election. In fact, Obama didn't even wait until his election to show off his foreign policy credentials. Although just a senator at the time, Obama traveled to several other countries during his campaign, likely in an attempt to beef up in that area. According to CNN, Obama's campaign trip included visits to France, Germany, Iraq, Israel, and Jordan. While there, Obama planned to meet prime ministers, party leaders, and the like. Much of Trump's newfound presidency-to-be has become a game of will-he-won't-he. Now, the first glimpse of Trump's foreign policy in practice could come on Thursday as he meets with Abe. First, though, somebody should tell Abe and his people where to meet the Trump camp."}

Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro speaks during an agreement signing ceremony with representatives of oil companies: Venezuelan Delta Petroleum and India's ONGC Videsh Limited, in Caracas, Venezuela November 4, 2016. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Tuesday he will meet with OPEC secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo in Caracas to discuss a potential agreement to limit global oil production. Tomorrow I have a meeting with Mohammed Barkindo to continue working on an agreement that should be signed between OPEC and non-OPEC (oil) producers at the end of this month that should stabilize the price of oil, Maduro said during a radio broadcast. Venezuela, which depends on oil for almost all of its foreign exchange revenue, has pushed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to slash crude output since oil prices collapsed in 2014. Its calls were initially ignored by major energy players such as Saudi Arabia, but oil producers have shown increased interest in coordinating output as continued weakness in crude markets pinches the finances of OPEC countries."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":209,"title":" Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran are meeting to discuss oil this week – and this is why it matters","class":0,"body":" If you have low expectations you won’t be disappointed – not a bad way to approach life, as well as economics. But it is particularly appropriate when approaching OPEC meetings, for the tensions within what has always been a disparate group of countries are greater than ever. Meeting after meeting has resulted in stalemate. Conventional wisdom says that will happen again this Wednesday, when the 14 OPEC members have an informal meeting in Algiers, following the International Energy Forum that starts on Monday. A top-level Russian delegation is at the forum, and it may join OPEC for the meeting. Yet there is a chance that this one might be different. There might be an agreement on a production freeze between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and a cap on production in Iran. If that happened there could be a real impact on the oil price.  In recent months both Russia and Saudi Arabia have been increasing production to record levels. Iran, in theory freed from sanctions, has been rebuilding its oil industry. On my quick back-of-an-envelope tally, those three account for one third of global oil production. Had they not boosted output this year, the oil price would have recovered much faster. Will they agree? The rumours fly. One story is that Russia will not join any talks with OPEC unless and until OPEC members agree on production levels. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran remain tense. But it is nevertheless in the self-interest of the producers to get an agreement; you cannot rule out the possibility that some sort of understanding could be reached. And then, just as hardly anyone predicted the collapse in the oil price that began two years ago, note that hardly anyone is predicting a recovery to $80 a barrel now. That would have huge consequences. For a start it would be the end of deflation and lead to a much faster rise in interest rates than the markets currently expect. I’m not saying that this will happen, but the possibility that it might makes this meeting in Algiers the most significant thing happening in the next few days. Oil Rig blown aground in Scotland Second, there will be some backward-looking data on the UK economy on Friday, confirming strong growth in the second quarter, and current account figures for the quarter too. More interesting will be hints about what is happening now, with a CBI distributive trades survey on Tuesday, and a GfK consumer confidence survey on Friday. There will also be the index of services, telling us what has been happening in the service sector in the early post-Brexit weeks. The thing to look for there, of course, will be evidence of a slowdown. My guess is that doomsayers will be disappointed; though Brexit has been a shock, it will take time for that shock to work through the system. This year is going to be all right. The problem, if there is to be one, comes in 2017. Third, I’m also interested in what is happening to the housing market. On Thursday there are Bank of England figures for mortgage approvals. These have been very weak in recent months and expect them to continue to be so. This suggests a weakening economy, but my guess is that it has much more to do with the increase in stamp duty. If the housing market flattens, as it looks very much as though it is doing, that will be a drag on consumption next year.  Meanwhile the US economy, always interesting, will be particularly fascinating as businesses are starting to plan for a Trump presidency. UK businesses (and I think international ones with large UK interests too) did not plan for Brexit. American business now is being more thorough. Any news about their planning will feed back into the financial markets, though probably not into popular debate. Finally, a longer-term issue: have we reached peak car? There has been a steady retreat from driving, with peak miles driven in the US being as far back as 2005, and licences for new drivers declining in popularity in both the US and UK. This has been widely noted. But what about the importance for the motor industry, particularly in Germany? Might having a large motor industry become a drag on the economy, not a strength? And what does that do to German industrial pre-eminence?  A big issue in the Brexit debate too."}

ENLARGE Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia's minister of energy, industry, and mineral resources, spoke at a conference in Tokyo on Sept. 1. Mr. Falih, along with Algeria’s oil minister, is planning to meet with the new secretary-general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Friday, ahead of an OPEC summit later this month. The oil ministers of Saudi Arabia and Algeria are planning to meet the new secretary-general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Paris on Friday as talks to limit petroleum output among the world’s biggest producers heats up before a summit later this month, people familiar with the matter said Thursday. The meeting is the first known gathering that Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih has held with a fellow member of OPEC since a new round of talks around production issues began in early August. The 14-nation cartel is struggling to find ways lift oil prices mired in a two-year funk and has planned an informal meeting on the sidelines of the conference in Algiers from Sept. 26 to 28. Algeria’s oil minister Noureddine Bouterfa and Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC’s new secretary-general, have been touring fellow producers in recent days, trying to raise support for a so-called production freeze—essentially putting a ceiling on output. A similar attempt to freeze production in April failed when Saudi Arabia backed out over OPEC member Iran’s refusal to join in the limits. New Saudi production figures, however, have heightened anticipation that the Saudis may be ready to agree to a freeze. Saudi Arabia pumped close to record levels of production in August at about 10.63 million barrels a day, Saudi industry officials said Thursday. They said that is down just slightly from a record 10.67 million barrels a day in July. Oil-industry experts have said that Saudi Arabia is unlikely to be able to sustain production higher than that level, making a freeze now relatively painless. On Monday, Mr. Falih agreed to cooperate more closely with his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak but didn’t commit to any limitations on production. Iran has already softened its stance on a freeze recently. The country is getting closer to reaching its goal of 4 million barrels a day of output, the level it had before Western sanctions on its nuclear program—lifted this year—crippled its oil industry."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":211,"title":" Britain and France snub EU’s emergency Trump meeting","class":0,"body":" Britain and France on Sunday night snubbed a contentious EU emergency meeting to align the bloc’s approach to Donald Trump’s election, exposing rifts in Europe over the US vote. Hailed by diplomats as a chance to send a signal of what the EU expects from Mr Trump, the plan fell into disarray after foreign ministers from the bloc’s two main military powers declined to attend the gathering demanded by Berlin and Brussels. The meeting comes as Mr Trump appointed his key deputies. The president-elect chose the more moderate establishment figure Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, to be his chief-of-staff over campaign chairman Stephen Bannon, who becomes chief strategist and counsellor. Mr Priebus’s appointment suggests Mr Trump is sweeping aside some of his campaign rhetoric to opt for a more traditional path. The split in Europe highlights the difficulties European capitals face in co-ordinating a response to Mr Trump, who has questioned the US’s commitments to Nato and free trade and hinted at seeking a rapprochement with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Donald Trump and Nigel Farage. Taken from Nigel Farage's Twitter page. Mr Trump at the weekend met Nigel Farage, the populist campaigner for the Uk to leave the EU, who has become the first foreign politician to meet the future US president. Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, tweeted: If Trump wanted to look statesmanlike to Europe, receiving Farage was probably the worst thing he could [do]. Boris Johnson, British foreign secretary, dropped out of the Brussels meeting, with officials arguing that it created an air of panic, while French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault opted to stay in Paris to meet the new UN secretary-general. Hungary’s foreign minister boycotted the meeting, labelling the response from some EU leaders as hysterical. A combination of Mr Trump’s election and Britain’s vote to leave the EU had triggered calls for a total overhaul of the EU’s foreign and defence policy, with Berlin and Paris demanding greater integration. If the US disengages from Europe, we need to look after our own security, said one EU diplomat. Ministers will discuss plans such as bolstering the EU’s ambition to mount joint operations during a scheduled meeting on Monday, which Mr Johnson and Mr Ayrault will attend. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg at the weekend warned both the US and its European partners against going it alone on defence matters. Paris and Berlin had been co-ordinating their response to Mr Trump’s election, while London has jockeyed to maintain its position as the US’s main European ally. The French president and German chancellor spoke before releasing two separate, guarded welcomes to the president-elect last week. Mr Johnson’s refusal to attend will add to an already difficult relationship with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who has told colleagues that he cannot bear to be in the same room as the British foreign secretary.

Instead the disarray highlighted a familiar problem for Berlin, according to diplomats. When the EU’s most powerful country wants to lead, other member states don’t necessarily follow, said one EU diplomat. But the German foreign ministry put a brave face on events, saying on Sunday: It’s good that the EU meets … to look into the consequences of the election of Donald Trump for Europe. Other European leaders have openly criticised the incoming president. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker last week accused Mr Trump of ignorance. We must teach the president-elect what Europe is and how it works. I believe we’ll have two years of wasted time while Mr Trump tours a world he doesn’t know.

Gathered around a circular table in Mrs Merkel's Chancellery, the leaders exchanged pleasantries but made no substantive remarks as the meeting started. Before the talks, Mrs May had a brief conversation with Mr Obama. British sources said their brush-by discussion was about the ongoing relationship between London and Washington rather than the US election result. Mrs May is also due to have a bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel to discuss Brexit - although the Prime Minister has no other formal meetings with the leaders of France, Italy or Spain. It comes after President Obama issued a parting snub to the special relationship, naming the German leader as his closest international partner of the last eight years. US President Barack Obama shakes hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel following their a joint news conference in Berlin, Germany, November 17, 2016 Has baton of global leadership passed from US to Germany? President Obama and Chancellor Merkel issued a joint rebuttal to the incoming era of Mr Trump on Thursday, penning an op-ed for more transatlantic cooperation on security, climate trade and trade.While never mentioning the incoming president by name, the two leaders upbraided some of Mr Trump's foreign policy positions. They praised the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) - which Mr Trump has cast doubt over - as the cornerstone of peace.Mr Obama and Mrs Merkel also reiterated their commitment and support for the Paris Agreement to cut global emissions, an accord from which Mr Trump has threatened to withdraw. The leaders' statements after the summit will be watched carefully to see how President Obama and his European allies position themselves in relation to the President-elect. European leaders will want guidance from Mr Obama on his successor's approach to NATO, after the President said last week that Donald Trump wanted to maintain NATO relationships after a meeting with his successor in the White House. Train rolls along border with Latvia and Russia. The world will be watching too to see what leaders will say on Syria and Ukraine after President-elect Trump signalled a possible rapprochement with Vladimir Putin during his election campaign. This in turn has raised questions over the future of the sanctions regime brought in by Washington and Brussels in 2014 over Ukraine.  Number 10 said Mrs May would press for continued condemnation of the ongoing offensive of the Syrian regime in Aleppo. Asked whether the leaders would issue a statement of condemnation against Syria's Assad, the Prime Minister's spokesperson said: We will clearly push how we resolve the situation in Syria, we must be united in calling for a sustained ceasefire. The meeting between Mrs May and European leaders comes after another awkward week for UK-EU relations after Boris Johnson was accused of insulting an Italian minister in a bizarre Brexit row over prosecco and fish and chips."}

The issue that...will be raised here again is the issue of them [Islamic State fighters] being dispersed around other countries in Africa and parts of the Middle East, not specifically back to the UK, said a Downing Street spokesperson. As we close down Daesh's [Islamic State/Isis] areas of operation in one part of the world we need to be mindful of the fact that they may regroup in other parts and how we set about tackling that. Obviously, the issue of Daesh fighters who've been in either Syria or Iraq returning to Europe is a matter of grave concern. Asked whether the leaders would jointly issue any condemnation against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the spokesperson responded: We will clearly push how we resolve the situation in Syria, we must be united in calling for a sustained ceasefire. European leaders are also expected to caution Obama's successor, Donald Trump, against easing the economic sanctions against Russia. This is also the first time the European heads of state are meeting face-to-face to talk about the outcome of US presidential elections. The presence of key leaders — five of the G7 members — in Berlin will provide a platform for an informal summit to touch upon other vital global issues such as Nato and tackling Russia as well. Talks over Brexit are unlikely to come up when the British and American leaders meet but it is bound to surface when May meets other European heads of state.

About 500 police officers demonstrated on Paris's Champs Elysées avenue on Thursday night, the third time they have taken to the capital's streets this week, while smaller protests took place in Evry, near where the firebomb attack took place, and Bobigny, just outside Paris. While in Brussels for a European Union summit, Hollande promised to meet police trade unions at the beginning of next week, although many protesters have accused the unions of failing to represent their interests. They complain of vehicles, police stations and body armour in a poor state and understaffing of a force that has been overstretched in the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks, the Euro 2016 and protests against the government's labour reform earlier this year.

{"id":216,"title":" In turnabout, Romney set to meet Trump","class":0,"body":" WASHINGTON — In a possible thaw that would have seemed inconceivable during the presidential campaign, Mitt Romney is scheduled to meet this weekend with Donald Trump, triggering a wave of speculation that the 2012 Republican nominee could serve in the new administration. If Romney and Trump come to terms while meeting at Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, N.J. — where the president-elect is spending the weekend — it would mark a remarkable turnabout for two men whose rhetoric grew exceptionally hostile over the course of the last year. Trump ran against the GOP status quo in the primaries, frequently citing Romney’s failed 2012 presidential bid. And Romney lambasted Trump as a phony’’ in a speech opposing his nomination. Several news organizations, citing sources close to Trump, reported that Romney was being considered for secretary of state, making him the latest trial balloon floated for the top role in the Cabinet. CNN said the two were going to meet this weekend. But Romney and his longtime aides remained mum — on both the meeting and the secretary of state possibility. Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Speculation about such a position is not without cause. In the nearly two years since Romney decided not to again pursue the presidency, those close to him have thought of the former Massachusetts governor as a future secretary of state. And in recent weeks, before Trump’s upset victory Nov. 8, some aides have suggested privately that Romney wanted to have a more prominent role in public life. But during the campaign Romney excoriated Trump in terms that were more pointed than almost any other Republican. Romney attacked Trump on moral grounds, decried his mistreatment of women, and ridiculed him for not releasing his taxes. Trump, while known to harbor grudges against those who attack him, could benefit from bringing Romney into his administration. The former Republican nominee would bring a level of seriousness and calm to a Trump transition that so far has been rocky and could provide a measure of stability in international capitals where leaders are unsure of, and in some cases even afraid of, policies Trump will enact. I think it’s good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Mr. Romney, Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican and top Trump adviser, told reporters at Trump Tower in New York. He’s meeting with a lot of talented people that he needs good relationships with. I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things, but he’ll be one of those I’m sure that’s reviewed, and Mr. Trump will make that decision. One of Trump’s top advisers, Kellyanne Conway, said of the Romney meeting: We’re working on it. During the Republican primaries, Romney was outraged by Trump’s rhetoric and behavior, and a comment from one of his sons — What will you tell the grandkids? — caused him to speak out. In a well-publicized speech in March, Romney denounced Trump’s bid for the White House, and declared that dishonesty is Donald Trump’s hallmark. Here’s what I know: Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud, Romney said at the time. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He’s playing members of the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat. Even after Trump secured enough support to become the Republican standard-bearer, Romney — who prides himself on remaining true to his principles and faith — refused to support Trump’s candidacy. I don’t want to see a president of the United State saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following, Romney said in June. Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle down racism and trickle down bigotry and trickle down misogyny — all of these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America. Trump was equally pointed, calling Romney’s 2012 campaign a disaster. Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog, Trump wrote on Twitter. Now he calls me racist — but I am least racist person there is. Trump also used colorful terms to refer to Romney’s efforts to gain Trump’s support during his 2012 bid. He was begging for my endorsement, Trump said. I could have said, ‘Mitt, drop to your knees.’ And he would have. After Trump’s win on Nov. 8, the president-elect made a point to publicly announce that Romney had offered his congratulations. Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win, Trump tweeted. Very nice! Word of a meeting with Romney — and even appointing him as secretary of state — bounced quickly around national security circles. That would be kind of extraordinary, said John Douglass, a retired general who was at the Pentagon dealing with the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H.W. Bush. It would clearly send the signal that Trump has the capability to forgive and forget. It also seemed to soothe some of Trump’s biggest critics. Mitt is a patriot. Period, said Katie Packer, who was Romney’s deputy campaign manager and helped lead the Never Trump movement. Romney was often ridiculed during his 2012 campaign for his lack of foreign policy credentials. Although he speaks fluent French — partly thanks to a Mormon mission served in France — he did not have a large foreign policy portfolio. A foreign trip during his campaign, meant to bolster his credentials, was marked by controversy and gaffes. Some of his positions were lampooned at the time. But he called Russia the number one geopolitical foe, which turned out to be prescient. And after the campaign, he continued making arguments about foreign policy. During a 2015 retreat in Deer Valley — which came four days before Trump announced his candidacy — Romney delivered a power point presentation titled, The Most Consequential Obama Foreign Policy Mistakes. Like so many things in his life, Romney in some ways would be following in his father’s footsteps: After losing his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968, George Romney served as secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Nixon — which was, at the time, a shocking appointment. But George Romney was not in the inner circle and often clashed with Nixon. I don’t know what the president believes in, he said at one point. Maybe he doesn’t believe in anything. George Romney eventually resigned, complaining to Nixon in his resignation letter that politicians don’t focus enough on real issues. Instead, he wrote, candidates tend to avoid specific positions concerning, and discussion of, ‘life and death’ issues in their formative and controversial stage for fear of offending uninformed voters and thus losing votes."}

China, as the world's second largest economy, has called for safeguarding the global free trade system and opposing protectionism in any form. After attending the APEC meeting, Xi will pay his first state visit to Peru, only about two months after his Peruvian counterpart Pedro Pablo Kuczynski -- who was sworn in on July 28 -- made his first foreign visit to China. Xi will hold talks with Kuczynski, meet President of Peruvian Congress Luz Salgado and give a speech at the Congress. The two heads of state are also scheduled to attend the closing ceremony of the China-Latin America and Caribbean 2016 Year of Culture Exchange. This year marks the 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries, which have witnessed long-term friendly relations and wide-ranging cooperation. After Peru, Xi will travel to Chile, the final stop of his three-nation tour of Latin America. It is Xi's third visit to Latin America as president since taking office in 2013. When addressing the Peruvian Congress, Xi is expected to expound on the thriving momentum of the comprehensive cooperative partnership China has forged with Latin America and the Caribbean, and make new proposals on propelling their cooperation."}

In fact, there are few things China wants more from America. As Societe Generale analyst Wei Yao put it in a recent note to clients, one upside to China under the Trump administration, in relative to the Obama administration, is that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade pact - which excluded China - looks more certainly doomed. The TPP is a trade agreement among 12 Pacific Rim countries that includes the US but excludes China. If it doesn't pass, China would have an opportunity to fill a vacuum left by the US. The most likely vehicle for that would be China's One Belt, One Road initiative, which seeks to create partnerships to build infrastructure and trade with the country's continental neighbors. And then there's the stuff that probably won't happen (most of the stuff) The rest of Trump's China policy is harder to pull off but would be similarly likely to negatively affect the US economy. Trump, who is set to be sworn into office on January 20, has promised to label China a currency manipulator on day one. He has long accused the country of keeping its currency, called the yuan or the renminbi, artificially low so that it can sell more exports. The problem with that is there are measurable criteria a country must meet for the Treasury to classify it that way (yes, Walter, this is not 'Nam, there are rules). Here are the criteria that must be met for a country to be considered a currency manipulator:1) a significant bilateral trade surplus with the US; 2) a material current account surplus (>3% of GDP); and 3) persistent one-sided intervention in its currency market. China meets only the first criterion. It does not fit the second, and as for the third, the country is doing the opposite.Even though the yuan is hitting six-year lows against the US dollar, China is actually trying to stop its currency from falling faster. It has been quite a costly effort too, but it's worth it when considering the country's ultimate goals. China wants to keep the yuan strong because it is trying to move its economy from one dependent on selling exports to one driven by the purchasing power of its own people. For the country to succeed in that endeavor the people need to have a currency strong enough to buy all kinds of goods, foreign and domestic. china changes in fx intervention chartSociete Generale We should also note that China was labeled a currency manipulator from 1992 to 1994, and you know what that did to the country? A steaming hot pile of nothing. The other thing Trump has suggested is putting a high tariff on goods made in China - something like 45%. All this would end up doing is making goods more expensive for Americans. This is something a Republican-controlled Congress - much of it still in favor of free trade - would have to pass. In that sense, it's not looking good for this campaign promise. A tariff has geopolitical implications too. It could also actually help China's leaders politically, according to Yao of Societe Generale. That's because Trump's policies, in the face of a slowing economy, could be used as a measure to stoke nationalism and place blame on the US rather than on China's government. This is a move the Obama administration has been careful to avoid. Chinese leaders and the propaganda machines they control have actually already started using Trump to push a nationalist agenda. Even before he won, outlets like People's Daily were saying the US election's tenor proved that it was a sick democracy. And by the way, we've tried this stuff For what it's worth, we already do punish China for violating trade agreements - the Obama administration brought 11 of the 19 suits against China with the World Trade Organization, for example - but the results aren't always what we expect. Take what has been going on with Chinese steel, for example. To keep its slowing economy going and keep people employed, China has been flooding the global market with cheap steel, despite promises to cut excess capacity. The US, in turn, has slapped tariffs of 500% on Chinese steel. That has had unintended consequences on our manufacturers who buy that steel. As such, demand is slowing in the US. The Australian bank Macquarie pointed this out in a note a few months ago. While output has been carefully managed by US producers to help maintain the tariff-driven price premium over other regions, apparent demand is clearly not good at -10% YoY over 2016 to date, analysts wrote, adding (emphasis ours): While destocking can explain part of this, we would reiterate our concern that higher steel prices are hurting US manufacturing competitiveness (and thus steel demand). As our recent note showed, the US is the biggest negative drag on global industrial production at the present time. And manufacturers that have to buy steel have been vocal about this. There's grumbling that the US mills are taking advantage of a tight market, and the price hikes are too much, too fast, Lisa Goldenberg, the president of Delaware Steel Co. of Pennsylvania, a steel trading and processing company, told The Wall Street Journal. Remember, if steel costs more, someone has to pay for it. And that someone is you, America."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":219,"title":"Filipino, Chinese presidents meet in sign of further thaw","class":0,"body":" The Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte has met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in a potential step toward the improvement of ties, which have recently been soured by a territorial dispute. Duterte and Xi met at the Chinese capital, Beijing, on Thursday, with the official Xinhua news agency reporting that the two leaders were to hold official talks and sign a series of cooperation documents between their governments. During the meeting, Duterte said the roots of the two countries’ bonds were deep and could not be easily harmed. The Chinese president also hailed Duterte’s visit as a step toward mending the damaged relations following years of tensions between the two countries. I hope we can follow the wishes of the people and use this visit as an opportunity to push China-Philippines relations back on a friendly footing and fully improve things, Xi said. Prior to the visit, the Filipino president had stressed his country’s pursuit of a shift away from Washington, a former long-standing ally, and toward Beijing, blasting the US’s policies and declaring an end to joint military exercises with the American military. So it’s about time to say good-bye, my friend. Your stay in my country was for you own benefit, said Duterte, who has also called for the removal of US troops from a group of southern islands in the Philippines. No more American interference. No more American exercises, he added. However, the Philippines became entangled in a bitter dispute with regional powerhouse China when it filed a complaint with an international tribunal over Chinese claims to territory in the South China Sea. The verdict by the international court, which was issued some three months ago and which favored the Philippines, angered China and provided ammo for Washington, which routinely pops in regional disputes unrelated to it. The handout photo, taken on March 16, 2015, purports to show Chinese vessels dredging sand at a reef in the Spratly Islands in the disputed South China Sea. (Via AFP)The tribunal accused Beijing of violating the Philippines’ economic and sovereign rights. China, however, rejected the ruling, saying the court had no jurisdiction over the issue. China did say, however, that it was ready to engage in dialog with the Philippines if Manila ignored the court ruling. China’s territorial claims to the South China Sea overlap in parts with those of Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei — besides the Philippines. Briefing reporters on the Thursday meeting between Duterte and Xi, a senior Chinese diplomat said the two had agreed to resume bilateral dialog on their territorial dispute. Both sides agreed that the South China Sea issue is not the sum total of the bilateral relationship, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin told reporters. Liu said the leaders briefly touched on the issue during their talks and agreed to return to the approach used five years ago of seeking a settlement through bilateral dialog. Duterte and the US: A Separation Later during the day, President Duterte made his strongest non-vulgar assertion against the US, yet. Speaking at a business forum in the presence of Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on Thursday, he said he was announcing his separation from Washington. Duterte has previously used a series of obscenities to describe US President Barack Obama and other world officials."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":220,"title":" Ecuador and China Bolster Ties with Xi Jinping Visit","class":0,"body":" China and Ecuador agreed to a new economic trade agreement on Thursday during President Xi Jinping's visit to Quito. The deal is set to increase production and investment between the two countries ahead of the APEC meeting in Lima, Peru.Xi and Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa signed a bilateral cooperation agreement which sets out pledges for major energy, infrastructure, financial, agriculture and manufacturing projects. Important projects discussed by the leaders included hydroelectric and petrochemical plants, as China continues to grow its economic power with Ecuador, and Latin America more widely. President Correa stated that the deal was important for Ecuador as China will soon be the biggest economy in the world. Since Correa came to power in 2007, Ecuador has seen high rates of Chinese investments in infrastructure, particularly following the 2008 global financial crisis. Ecuador’s economy, while traditionally heavily reliant on oil prices, has recently moved towards diversifying. The two heads of state also spoke of the importance of international and regional cooperation and their common interests working in bodies such as the U.N. and issues of development issues for the global south, the global economy and climate change. While hosting Xi in the capital, Correa stressed the clear political will of governments to create a strong bond based on trust, respect and mutual complementarity. China supported Ecuador’s 2017 presidency over the Group of 77, a United Nations coalition for the economic interests of developing countries, which now includes over 100 members. Both countries also signaled their intent to increase exchanges in science, technology, communication, culture, sports and education. President Correa also thanked China for its support after the April 16 earthquake which killed over 600 people. Correa estimated that the damage from the earthquake could cost up to US$3 billion. In his third visit to Latin America, Xi will also travel to meet Peru President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and President Michelle Bachelet of Chile. Xi will attend the APEC leaders meeting in Lima from Nov. 19 to 20. One of the big topics of the meeting will be China’s proposal for new free trade agreements, now increasingly important amid the all but dead Trans-Pacific Partnership, the much-maligned free trade deal pushed by U.S. President Barack Obama but which President-elect Donald Trump has campaigned on rejecting."}

Since taking office June 30, Duterte has announced his administration’s pursuit of an independent foreign policy, declaring his country’s separation from long-time ally the United States as it seeks to improve relations with Russia and China. News broadcaster ABS-CBN reported Thursday that Duterte is scheduled to depart at noon for Lima to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leader’s meeting Nov. 19-20. On the sidelines of the summit, he is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President President Xi Jinping on Saturday. On Tuesday, Duterte said that he had a long talk with Russia’s ambassador to the Philippines. I reiterated my desire to meet Putin, bilateral, GMA News quoted him as saying during a dinner he hosted for journalists who covered his election campaign. I want to be friends with him [Putin]. I just want to the two countries to be the best of friends. This is an economic world. If there are things we can sell them or export to them, it would be better, he added. The upcoming APEC summit will be the first attended by Duterte and the last attended by outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama, who Duterte has cursed at on several occasions. This year’s meeting will convene amid concerns over the protectionist policies advocated by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Despite his criticisms of Obama -- who canceled a meeting with Duterte in September after one of his outbursts -- the Philippine leader has made welcoming comments toward Trump. I don’t want to fight now that Trump’s there, Duterte said after Trump’s victory in the Nov. 8 election. May you live, Mr. Trump! We both curse at the slightest of reason. We are alike, he added. Before departing for Peru, Duterte told reporters that he might follow Russia in withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which expressed concern last month over his government’s bloody campaign against illegal drugs. I might follow their lead. Why? These people only pick on small countries like us, ABS-CBN quoted him as saying. On Wednesday, Putin withdrew Russia from the ICC after the court referred to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in eastern Ukraine in 2014 as an armed conflict. The ICC is also facing mounting pressure due to withdrawals by several African states. Under Duterte’s anti-drug campaign, more than 4,800 people have been killed in police operations and vigilante-style killings since July 1, according to national police data cited by Rappler.

It was important that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations would be maintained, said Obama at a joint press conference with Merkel after their meeting at the chancellery in Berlin. Merkel emphasized that she had always spoken out for a trade agreement between the EU and the United States, two major trading areas of the world. The negotiations had made a lot progress, but they could not be ended now, said Merkel. I continue believing that the EU is one of the greatest achievements in the world, said the outgoing U.S. President, while calling on the countries of Europe to strive to maintain the 28-nation bloc. People have to cultivate these achievements and fight for them, said Obama, adding that Britain's exit from the EU should be conducted as smoothly and orderly and transparently as possible. Meanwhile, Obama warned his successor, president-elect Donald Trump, of the important principled task in relation to Russia. I've sought a constructive relationship with Russia, said Obama, My hope is that the president-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interest align. The U.S. president also said he hoped that Trump would not simply take a realpolitik approach in cutting deals and doing whatever's convenient at the time. Merkel thanked Obama for the excellent cooperation and praised him as a reliable partner in difficult times. She expressed her gratitude for a close, trusting and friendly cooperation over the eight-year term he served. The Chancellor said she would do everything possible to work well with the newly-elected president. Obama also thanked Merkel for Germany's contribution to the fight against the Islamic State (IS) and to the Syrian conflict. In an interview with German broadcaster ARD and German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, Obama had previously warned of growing political tensions in industrialized countries. If the global economy does not react to people who feel left behind when inequality continues to grow, we will see the split in the industrialized countries expand, Obama was quoted as saying. Obama and Merkel will meet with French President Francois Hollande, British Prime Minister Theresa May, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Friday in Berlin to exchange views on the future of the Ukraine crisis, the future approach towards Russia, the civil war in Syria and the fight against IS."}

(Xinhua/Rao Aimin) MOSCOW, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Russian President Vladimir Putin met here Tuesday and exchanged views on boosting bilateral cooperation and further promoting China-Russia ties. During their talks, Li extended sincere greetings from Chinese President Xi Jinping to the Russian president. China and Russia, the biggest neighbors to each other with a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination, have seen their relations and cooperation keep moving steadily forward and continuously bear new fruits, Li said. China-Russia cooperation is not only beneficial to the two sides, but also to regional and world peace, stability, development and prosperity, said Li, who arrived in Moscow Tuesday after concluding the 21st China-Russia Prime Ministers' Regular Meeting with his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev in St. Petersburg. The two countries should implement the consensus reached by their heads of state and lift China-Russia relations to a new level, he said. China is willing to work with Russia to explore cooperation potential and expand cooperation areas, said the premier. China would also join hands with Russia to consolidate the recovering and stabilizing momentum of bilateral trade, and promote cooperation in major projects of oil, natural gas, civilian nuclear energy, and aerospace, Li said. The two countries should enhance cooperation in the fields of finance and infrastructure construction, and promote bilateral cooperation of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which would provide necessary support for cooperations between the two countries' major enterprises while stimulating the market vitality, Li said. China would also work with Russia to advance people-to-people exchanges and consolidate the public support for bilateral ties, he said. For his part, Putin noted the close exchanges between the two countries' heads of state and government officials and the smooth operation of their inter-governmental cooperation mechanisms. The successful 21st China-Russia Prime Ministers' Regular Meeting has promoted the development of pragmatic cooperation between the two countries, Putin said. At present, Russia-China trade has stabilized for the better, with sound cooperation in the fields of electromechanical equipments and import and export of agricultural products, positive development in energy cooperation and great prospect for aerospace cooperation, Putin said. Russia is willing to work with China to continue expanding bilateral investment, strengthen cooperation in such areas as high-speed railways and finance so as to promote the development of bilateral ties and advance cooperation, said the president. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the signing of the China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation and the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the China-Russia strategic partnership of coordination.

{"id":224,"title":" WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TURKEY, RUSSIA, CHINA MEET IN MIDDLE EAST","class":0,"body":" Last days and end times predictions are common throughout history. It’s easy to explain them away – when people look for answers, they gaze at the heavens. And in a period of turmoil, predicting the end of all things can be oddly comforting to believers. Evidence, however, makes this time different. The return of Israel. The formation of a grand alliance with the very nations mentioned in Scripture. The gathering of the mightiest armies in the world in Syria. The emergence of a caliphate. The rise of a new Christian power. Put all of it together and it’s clear believers are living in the most prophetic times since Jesus Christ first appeared on Earth, according to Pastor Carl Gallups. He recently appeared on the internationally known renowned radio talk show Coast to Coast to discuss the extraordinary developments described in his new book When the Lion Roars: Understanding the Implications of Ancient Prophecies for Our Time. God doesn’t do anything without revealing at least the rudimentary parts of His plan to His people, to His servants, to the prophets, the pastor told host Richard Syrett. Gallups said the Bible provides dozens of signposts to tell believers the Last Days were approaching when they began to converge. And that’s precisely what is happening today, Gallups warned. When I sat down to write this, I probably had six or seven things that I really wanted to emphasize because I could see them clearly and knew they were astounding, the pastor said. By the time I was finished with the book I had outlined almost two dozen things right out of the Scriptures directly or indirectly that are happening right now before our eyes. They’ve either already happened or they are happening and the daily news is recording it. Or, there are two or three or four things the Bible said would happen which haven’t happened yet but goodness, I realize, and readers will realize, we’re the first generation in human history that could literally see these things this week. Drawing on his investigative experience as a former law enforcement officer, Gallups wrote the book by taking what the Bible said would be some of the prolific markers in the days just before the return of the Christ and comparing them to what mainstream media, military, scientific and other sources were saying. Gallups claimed the results were shocking and ominous, as seemingly each day’s headlines provided new evidence real world events were lining up with the predictions of the Bible. Chief among these developments are the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, especially in Syria. As Gallups observed, the Bible predicts a great coalition of nations will gather in the last days to attack the reconstituted Israel. The faint outlines of that alliance, Gallups claimed, are beginning to be seen. At the center is the nation of Turkey, once the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate and now under the rule of an increasingly extreme Islamic government. While many Christians have argued Magog represents the nation of Russia, Gallups, along with other Christian teachers such as Joel Richardson, argues Turkey is involved. For centuries, most scholars said Magog had to be Russia, Gallups explained. The reason had to do with tribal names, historical records, the Table of Nations in Genesis, and other evidence. But just in the last several years, some scholars have observed that Turkey is the originator of the Russian people and the East European people. Well, the Bible says Turkey is where Noah’s Ark landed after the flood and if that is a true account, and I believe it is, that means the world started over in Turkey. The pastor argued Turkey is already deeply involved in the current geopolitical struggles in the Middle East. We’re watching Turkey become an Islamic state again and try to become the center of a new caliphate, Gallups intoned. Russia shows up again in the Middle East and starts fighting ISIS and bringing its military troops in. Turkey shoots down a Russian warplane. And Turkey belongs to NATO. Extraordinary events predicted centuries in advance are unfolding now. Here is your guide to the incredible prophecies being fulfilled before our very eyes. Don’t miss the bestselling sensation from one of America’s most prolific and beloved pastors. When the Lion Roars: Understanding the Implications of Ancient Prophecies for Our Time by Carl Gallups, available now in the WND Superstore. What’s more, the underlying foundations of the geopolitical order are shifting, as China is slowly becoming a Christian power. There is predicted by Scripture to be a great revival in China, the pastor said. By 2030, China is slated to be the largest Christian nation on the planet, that is, containing the largest number of people professing that they are Christians. Now Christianity, full blown Christianity, is for all intents and purposes, outlawed in China right now. Most of the Christians are in underground churches yet they’re growing by leaps and bounds. Noting the mention in Isaiah 49 of Sinim, which Gallups thinks refers to China, the pastor argued the world’s most populous nation will play a huge role in the end times. And while Christians should cheer the increasing number of people joining the faith in the huge country, Gallups argues China may also play a negative role as its military moves into the Middle East. Explaining Revelation 9:16, which mentions an army of 200 million in the Middle East, Gallups says the sheer scale of the force means China likely will be involved in some way. Bible scholars have long debated the meaning of passages which reference a 200 million man army fighting in the Middle East, he said. They’ve asked, ‘Who in the world could field a 200 million man army?’ Now, I don’t think a single nation has to do it, the Scriptures do not say that, they just say there has to 200 million people fighting. But for hundreds and hundreds of years, scholars have said it looks like China is going to show in the Middle East because they have the capability of putting millions of millions, maybe tens of millions and some scholars have calculated maybe even hundreds of millions in the Middle East. But when will Red China militarily intervene in the Middle East? Though the mainstream media has not widely promoted it, Gallups observes the Chinese military is already there. Thus, every major global power has forces near the exact location where the Bible predicts a huge global war is to take place. There they are now, Gallups warns. We’re the first generation in history to see China and Russia show up in the Middle East, plant themselves in Syria, use each other’s military troops, and make alliances with Iran, Persia. Plus, we now have Turkey making nice with Russia. Now look at this coalition – Turkey, Russia, Iran, China, Syria – I mean that is stuff of Bible prophecy. Not only is it just our generation that has seen it, but all of this has happened in the last year and a half. Thus, Gallups urges Christians not to delay and to turn to God immediately. He argues current events should give believers a sense of urgency. We are living in the most profoundly prophetic time since the first coming of Jesus Christ, Gallups intoned. And our Messiah is coming back regardless of what we do. Extraordinary events predicted centuries in advance are unfolding now.

{"id":225,"title":" Japan's PM Abe meets Trump, says confident can build trust","class":0,"body":" Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described Donald Trump as a trustworthy leader after meeting the U.S. president-elect on Thursday to get clarity on statements Trump had made while campaigning that had caused concern about the alliance. Abe, speaking after the hastily arranged 90-minute meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan, reporters: The talks made me feel sure that we can build a relationship of trust. But he would not disclose specifics because the conversation was unofficial. Trump, in a brief entry on his Facebook page accompanied by a photo of the two men, said: It was a pleasure to have Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stop by my home and begin a great friendship. Japan's leadership has been nervous about the future of an alliance that is core to Tokyo's diplomacy and security. Trump had fanned worries in Tokyo and beyond with comments on the possibility of Japan acquiring nuclear arms, demands that allies pay more for keeping U.S. forces on their soil or face their possible withdrawal, and his opposition to the U.S.-led 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade pact. Abe had worked closely with President Barack Obama on the TPP trade pact, which was part of Obama's push to counter the rising strength of China and a pillar of Abe's economic reforms. Alliances cannot function without trust. I am now confident that President-elect Trump is a trustworthy leader, said Abe, describing the talks as candid and held in a warm atmosphere. Abe gave Trump a golf driver and received golf-wear in return, Japanese officials said. Photographs taken inside the ornate meeting room at Trump Tower showed Abe accompanied only by an interpreter and Trump by his daughter Ivanka, her husband and Trump adviser Jared Kushner, and Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn whom a senior Trump official said on Thursday had been offered the national security adviser position. Abe said he had agreed to meet again with Trump at a convenient time to cover a wider area in greater depth. It was unclear if that would happen before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.Trump official Kellyanne Conway told CBS earlier on Thursday that any deeper conversations about policy and the relationship between Japan and the United States will have to wait until after the inauguration. Back in Tokyo, Finance Minister Taro Aso commented: The meeting ran longer than planned, which means that they were on the same wavelength and it went well. Some of Trump's campaign rhetoric suggested an image of Japan forged in the 1980s, when Tokyo was seen by many in the United States as a threat to jobs and a free-rider on defense. A Trump adviser who spoke earlier in the week, however, stressed a more positive view and credited Abe with making changes. Frankly, the prime minister has been more assertive and forthright in trying to make those changes to Japan’s global posture, he said. Trump, a brash billionaire real estate magnate, and Abe, a political blue blood, share a stated desire to raise their countries' global standing and both have support from right-wing constituencies. Abe has boosted Japan's overall defense spending since taking office in 2012. He has also stretched the limits of its pacifist postwar constitution to allow the military to take a bigger global role. Japan's defense spending, though, still stands at just over 1 percent of GDP compared with more than 3 percent in the United States. Abe was expected to see Obama at an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru on the weekend. Hours before Abe and Trump met, Obama's secretary of state, John Kerry, and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met in Lima to discuss the Paris climate accord - a deal Trump has pledged to exit. Diplomats and analysts say that however good the atmospherics, it will be hard to assess Trump's policies on security issues ranging from overseas deployments of U.S. troops, China's maritime assertiveness and the North Korean nuclear threat until Trump makes key appointments.

{"id":226,"title":" Trump plans meeting with former critic Mitt Romney as transition outreach broadens ","class":0,"body":" President-elect Donald Trump plans to meet this weekend with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, a fierce critic during the campaign, to discuss his transition operation and a potential role as secretary of state, people close to the transition said Thursday. Trump’s outreach to Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, could help bridge the divide between the president-elect’s advisers and the GOP establishment, and send a signal to foreign capitals that Trump is interested in a more conventional figure as the nation’s top diplomat. Late Thursday night, Trump offered the national security adviser post to retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, according to a person close to the transition team. Also Thursday, Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, said in an interview with McClatchy News Service that he would not have an official role in Trump’s administration, despite having previously been identified as a potential secretary of state. Gingrich confirmed the report in an interview with The Washington Post. I think it’s good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Mr. Romney, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who also is being considered for Trump’s Cabinet, told reporters outside Trump Tower in New York. He’s meeting with a lot of talented people that he needs good relationships with. I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things, but he’ll be one of those I’m sure that’s reviewed, and Mr. Trump will make that decision. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet The disclosure of their meeting came as something of a surprise. Romney had been one of the earliest and most vocal critics of Trump among the GOP leadership, ripping the real estate mogul last March after squelching speculation that he would mount a late primary challenge to Trump. If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished, Romney said, adding that dishonesty is Trump’s hallmark. Romney also criticized Trump for racially charged campaign rhetoric, prompting Trump to write on Twitter that Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist — but I am least racist person there is. Romney took a more tempered tone after Trump’s general election triumph last week, and called him to offer his congratulations. The news came as Trump’s transition to power kicked into higher gear. Transition officials were expected to fan out across federal agencies, and Trump prepared for an important meeting with Japan’s prime minister. The 5 p.m. session with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump’s first with a foreign leader since the election, has raised questions among some in Washington’s foreign policy community because Trump has apparently not been briefed by the State Department. Officials said Wednesday that the transition team has not reached out to State. A former State Department official said such a meeting with a foreign leader would normally be preceded by numerous briefings from key diplomats, which is considered especially important here because the Japanese are concerned about comments Trump made on the campaign trail. The president-elect repeatedly said that Japan should pay more for its own defense and be less reliant on the United States. [Japan’s prime minister hopes to start building ‘trusting relationship’ with Trump] The world does not stop for the transition,’’ said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak freely. Trump would want an intelligence briefing. You’d probably want to get briefed on what’s what happening in the region.’’ But Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Thursday that the session at Trump Tower, which Vice President-elect Mike Pence will attend, will be much less formal than in the future because Trump has yet to assume office. We are very sensitive to the fact that President Obama is still in office for the next two months,’’ Conway said. As Trump remained ensconced with close aides in his Manhattan office tower, his transition team appeared to signal Thursday that Sessions is a leading candidate to be attorney general. The President-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Senator Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama’s Attorney General and U.S. Attorney,’’ the team said in a statement about Trump’s meeting with Sesisons on Wednesday. While the statement cautioned that nothing has been finalized,’’ Sessions’s 14-year stint in those two posts in the 1980s and 1990s would be his primary qualifications to lead the Justice Department. Sessions’s former staff director of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brian Benczkowski, is also helping to manage the Justice Department transition for Trump’s team, lawyers familiar with the matter have said. Sessions, a top Trump adviser known for his hardline views on immigration, has been a rising force in the transition team and is also under consideration for defense secretary. His nomination for Justice would likely bring a re-examination of his failed nomination by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 to be a federal judge. A bipartisan panel of senators on the Judiciary Committee declined to send his nomination to the Senate floor that year amid allegations that he had made what some characterized as racist remarks. Sessions, who has been a senator for 20 years, has vehemently denied holding any racist views and has said he supported civil rights in Alabama, where he grew up outside of Selma. [In Trump’s Washington, rival powers and whispers in the president’s ear] Trump’s meeting with Abe arose from a phone conversation between the Japanese leader and Trump. When Abe called to congratulate Trump shortly after his victory, he mentioned that he would be passing through New York this week and suggested a meeting. That would be awesome, Trump immediately responded, according to people briefed on the conversation. The two leaders have much to discuss. Trump has vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that Abe recently pushed through his parliament. And the president-elect caused jitters in both Japan and South Korea during the campaign by saying both nations were not paying enough for their defense and that he would make them pay more — perhaps even all — of the costs of hosting U.S. military bases. Since Trump’s victory, the Japanese government has been taking a wait-and-see approach. Trump said various things during his campaign, but I will not presuppose what he will do as president, Tomomi Inada, Japan’s defense minister, said late last week. She added, however, that Japan is paying its fair share toward base costs. In a new development Thursday, Trump’s transition team announced that anyone serving in the new administration would be banned for life from lobbying for any foreign government. Trump had proposed such a ban in an ethics plan he unveiled last month, but it is unclear how the ban would be implemented. There is no current law that imposes a lifetime ban on post-government employment for administration officials, with one exception — there is a lifetime ban on certain members of the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office from representing foreign governments after leaving the agency. The reasoning is to prevent them from essentially switching sides and using the knowledge they gained while representing U.S. interests to weaken or amend the agreement to the benefit a foreign country. A lifetime ban like the one Trump proposed raises constitutional issues, and would have to be more narrowly tailored to pass muster in the courts — for example, if the ban was limited to certain State Department or Defense Department officials whose jobs involved working closely with foreign governments. But a blanket lifetime ban could be unconstitutional. Lifetime bans are really problematic from a legal standpoint because it prevents people from making a living, said Brett Kappel, a political law and government ethics attorney. A lifetime ban on anybody in the administration ever becoming a representative of a foreign government? I don’t see how that would hold up in court. It is also unclear whether the ban would be implemented by legislation or executive order. Meanwhile, the pace of the transition appeared to quicken. Offices prepared for Trump’s teams in departments and agencies across the government had remained empty Wednesday. But the White House said that it received paperwork, signed Tuesday evening by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, necessary for the teams to move into the department offices and begin to receive briefings from current officials. The names of people on the landing teams for the State Department, the Justice Department, the Pentagon and the National Security Council will be submitted to the White House on Thursday and announced Friday, the transition team said Thursday in a conference call with reporters. Economic policy landing teams will be announced Monday, followed by teams devoted to domestic policy and independent federal agencies. The transition released a list of 29 presidents and prime ministers with whom it said Trump and Pence have spoken since the election. And transition communications director Jason Miller said that reports of turmoil within the transition following the ouster of several senior team members in recent days came largely from folks on the outside and those who feared that Trump was preparing to drain the swamp, as he’s promised. Miller declined to speculate on the timing of appointment announcements, saying that the president-elect is going to get this right and that names would be put forward when Trump was ready. He also denied reports that Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, had been instrumental in purging members of the transition seen as close to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whom Pence replaced as the head of the team last week. Miller said Trump met with several advisers and candidates for administration positions Wednesday, including Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), investor Steve Feinberg, Success Academy Charter Schools chief executive Eva Moskowitz and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.). Miller did not elaborate on which people on the list are candidates to join the administration. Price is considered a candidate to lead the Department of Health and Human Services Trump will meet Thursday with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.), Florida Gov. Rick Scott, former secretary of state Henry Kissinger and retired Gen. Jack Keane, among others, Miller said. Attention continued to be mainly focused on potential national security picks. Trump campaign surrogates said former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani remained at the top of the rumored list for secretary of state, along with former State Department official John Bolton. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who visited Trump on Tuesday in Manhattan, emerged as a defense secretary candidate. Breaking news about local government in D.C., Md., Va. Farther down the defense list were George W. Bush national security adviser Stephen V. Hadley and former senator James M. Talent (R-Mo.). Frank Gaffney, a far-right conspiracy theorist who was described in some media reports as a Trump transition adviser and possible pick for a national security job, said Wednesday that he had not been contacted by anyone from the team. His statement followed one by Miller, the transition communication chief, that Gaffney is a nice guy, but he’s not part of the transition team and was not advising it. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), mentioned as a possible CIA director after the leading candidate, former chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan, was among those purged early this week, is a transition adviser but is not interested in a post, a congressional aide said. Former congressman Pete Hoekstra, also a Michigan Republican and a former committee chairman, said in an interview that he’d told the transition if they have a role for me, I’d be more than happy to discuss it with them. Hoekstra said the Trump team was going to expand its outreach, absolutely. But they’re going to do it in a methodical way. Despite intense media scrutiny and swirling rumors in Washington, Trump’s timetable was still well within the bounds of his immediate predecessors. Obama did not announce his first Cabinet pick until nearly a month after the 2008 election; he presented his national security team en masse Dec. 1 that year. Confirmation of George W. Bush’s 2000 victory did not come until a Supreme Court decision more than a month after the Nov. 7 election."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":227,"title":" Asia Minute: Japan’s Prime Minister is First Foreign Leader to Meet President-Elect Trump","class":0,"body":" Donald Trump’s meeting yesterday with Japan’s Prime Minister has made national newscasts in the United States. But in Japan, it’s been a continuing story for some time. HPR’s Bill Dorman has more in today’s Asia Minute. The rhetoric of candidate Donald Trump became a topic of growing concern in Japan as the U.S. election came to a climax. Japan was not a dominant topic during the  presidential debates, but it did come up from time to time on the Trump campaign trail.  And never in a positive context.The usual references were trade deficits and additional payment to the U.S. for service members stationed in Japan. There was also the suggestion that Japan develop nuclear weapons—a non-starter of a policy proposal for the only country to have experienced the devastation of a nuclear bomb...twice. But as someone who has spent his career maneuvering the complicated waters of Japanese politics, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recognized an opportunity. After the election results were clear, Abe moved quickly to become the first foreign leader to meet the president-elect. Abe said he didn’t want to share details of what he called a really cordial ninety-minute talk because it was an informal meeting.  Abe also said I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence. Abe’s nearly four years in office have been marked by a controversial and more hawkish approach to the military. He’s reinterpreted Japan’s constitution to allow a greater role for the country’s self-defense forces and boosted military spending. Next up on the Abe diplomatic calendar: this weekend’s APEC meetings in Peru."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":228,"title":" Traveling in Style: A Look at Vladimir Putin’s Many Modes of Transportation","class":0,"body":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has a hyper-busy schedule in the coming days, but his movement will not deter the traffic in the capital and will not create problems for drivers as Putin has his own method of transportation. Avoiding Traffic Jams: The Russian President prefers to fly by helicopter than travel by car and he has been using this type of transport actively for several years now, sometimes leaving armored limousines in his garage. Vladimir Putin prefers Russian made technology and that is why he flies exclusively on Russian Mi-8. Noticing the president’s interest in the helicopter, holding ‘Helicopters of Russia’ decided to develop a new improved version of the Mi with a better-quality interior for a more comfortable journey. The layout of the new VIP cabin was demonstrated to Putin a few years ago. The improved Mi-8 is sound proof; it has leather armchairs and a sofa, mood lighting, a huge TV and all kinds of home appliances — from refrigerators to coffeemakers. © SPUTNIK/ ALEXEI DRUZHININ Russian President Vladimir Putin seen in the cockpit of the Mi-34 helicopter exhibited by the Russian Helicopters manufacturer. (File) During last year’s International Aviation and Space Salon MAKS, the Russian President examined a ready-made mockup of the helicopter and even invited the prince of the United Arab Emirates to take a look. It seems that there must be something inside it that will surprise the monarch who is undoubtedly used to luxuries himself. Riding in Style: On the ground, Vladimir Putin travels around in a Mercedes-Benz S600 Pullman. There are 11 such vehicles registered in the Federal Security Service. In total there are 48 Mercedes-Benz S600 in the treasury of the Federal Security Service. Each car costs somewhere between 6 million to 64 million rubles with four cars set at a price more expensive than 60 million rubles.  © SPUTNIK/ SERGEY GUNEEV Automobile of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. (File) Putin did not only ride in limousines, but also in minibuses. As a president, he dramatically increased the number of visits across the country. Therefore special minivans were manufactured with special protection body with 8-10 seats, which can comfortably accommodate him and his entourage. President’s Driver: Being the driver of top politicians is no light matter. The applicant has to pass a serious psycho-physiological test and training to drive in extreme conditions. In addition, the driver has to have worked in the operational division of the FSO. Only after that can one apply to be the president or prime minister’s driver. Overall, training and tests take somewhat between seven and fifteen years. The president has more than ten drivers. All of them are high-class professionals, but even then they train once a week. The trainings include mandatory shooting while driving, driving in conditions which simulate ice, driving through water barriers and explosions. They say that after each such training the drivers lose around several pounds. Their working day begins with a medical examination, instructions and analysis of recent accidents in Moscow. Presidential Entourage: The presidential motorcade is transported by a special cargo squad aboard ‘Rossiya’ aeroplanes. During a visit to Vienna in June 2014, the Russian President Procession consisted of 27 cars and 10 motorcycles — mostly Austrian police. The cars that definitely belonged to the Russian President included a limousine and several minibuses with alarm systems. The city officials did not block the traffic but asked the oncoming traffic to stay to the right. For security reasons during presidential trips across Russia the license plate is not placed on the front of the vehicle. As a result, when several identical vehicles pass by, the onlooker cannot tell them apart. The back room is needed for guiding the security personnel. This tradition has been in place since the time of Joseph Stalin. During foreign trips much depends on how the host country is willing to receive the delegation.New Presidential Term Means New Car: At the end of 2017, the presidential garage will receive new cars from the ‘Cortege’ project. This means that the audience will see the newest addition most likely during the next presidential inauguration. The Cortege project is being created on the orders of the government since 2013. On the basis of a single platform, developed by the Moscow Scientific Research Automobile and Engine Institute, it is planned to start commercial production of limousines and sedans, SUVs and minivans. According to the plan a wealthy buyer will be able to buy the same car as the president, although it will have less security features. By 2020, it is expected that 4-5 thousand cars will be produced under the Cortege project. In 2015, the budget allocation for the project amounted to 3.6 billion rubles, in 2016 another 3.7 billion were added. In Air and Underwater: The Russian fleet includes Il-96-300 and Tu-214 planes. The Sukhoi Super jet 100 is set to join the fleet soon. The squad also has a flying point of control — this aircraft is equipped with special communications systems, allowing the president to negotiate and manage the nuclear forces of Russia in encrypted mode. All departures of these aircraft are made from the Vnukovo-2 government airport. The main presidential plane is a much modified version of the Il-96 passenger. In flight, the head of state can contact any agency, institution and conduct international calls or conference calls. Vladimir Putin can move about not only in the air but on water as well. The President has two yachts, three ships, seven boats and one sailing catamaran. This unusual means of transport used by the President is provided to him by other organizations."}

{"id":230,"title":" Duterte meets ‘idol’ Putin of Russia, invites China’s Xi to PHL","class":0,"body":"PRESIDENT Rodrigo R. Duterte on Saturday noon, Nov. 19 (past midnight of Nov. 20 in Manila), kicked off his participation at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders’ meeting in Lima, Peru, by holding bilateral talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Mr. Duterte described as my idol and favorite hero in a recent Al Jazeera interview. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Philippine President Rodrigo R. Duterte meet for the first time at the APEC Summit in Peru, Nov. 19. The meetings took place amid Mr. Duterte’s avowed pursuit of an independent foreign policy pivoting away from longtime ally the United States. In lieu of the United States, Mr. Duterte, a student of Jose Maria Sison during the Cold War era, has time and again referred to Russia and China, remarking of late that he would be the first to join a new order by the two global powers. Saturday’s appointment was the first encounter between Messrs. Duterte and Putin, who was already in their meeting room at the Swissôtel in the Peruvian capital when his Filipino counterpart arrived, as shown in a video posted by Presidential Communications (Government of the Philippines) on its Facebook page. Walking past behind Mr. Putin’s delegation, Mr. Duterte shook hands with the Russian leader who, in turn, shook hands with each of Mr. Duterte’s delegation, including his aide or special assistant Christopher Bong Go. During the meeting, Mr. Duterte expressed his pleasure [in] meeting President Putin and his respect for the latter’s leadership, as the Presidential Communications Office said in a prompt statement. Mr. Putin, in turn, said it was my pleasure to meet you. Then he congratulated Mr. Duterte on his election victory this year, noting that May 9, Election Day in the Philippines this year, is one of the most important holidays in Russia -- Victory Day, a holiday that commemorates the victory over Nazism in the Great Patriotic War. And it is a victory day for you too, so I would like to congratulate you personally once again, the Russian leader added. Mr. Putin also told Mr. Duterte: This year we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between our countries. He noted further, From the historical viewpoint, this is a very short period, but we have managed to achieve a great deal to develop a comprehensive partnership and build up trust between our countries.For his part, Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto R. Yasay, Jr. said in another statement by Malacañang: [W]e acknowledge that in the past somehow even as we are celebrating long years of diplomatic relationship with Russia, our relationship has not really matured especially in the area of trade and investments and commercial relationships.‘WESTERN HYPOCRISY’Mr. Duterte in that meeting said to Mr. Putin: I have been looking for this moment to meet you Mr. President, not only because you represent a great country but [also because] of your leadership too.Soon after the formalities, Mr. Duterte was railing at Western bullying and hypocrisy before Mr. Putin, in remarks that were neither in Malacañang’s statements nor in the edited video on Facebook, but were transcribed It was good until it lasted, Mr. Duterte said about his separation from the United States. Of late, I see a lot of these Western nations bullying small nations. And not only that, they are into so much hypocrisy, he also said in his meeting with Mr. Putin that lasted 45 minutes. And they seem to start a war but are afraid to go to war. That is what is wrong with America and the others. They’ve been waging wars in so many places -- in Vietnam, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, for one single reason that there was a weapon of mass destruction, and there was none. Mr. Duterte also said the United States forced the Philippines to contribute soldiers in its wars in Vietnam and Iraq. They insist if you are allied with them that they follow you. They go to the Korean War, nothing happened. They got defeated, he said.When Manila pulled out non-combat troops that were part of the US-led coalition against Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2004 following threats to behead a kidnapped Filipino worker there, truck driver Angelo dela Cruz, Washington made it hard for us, Mr. Duterte told Mr. Putin. These are the things I see which [are] not a good idea, he added. Despite his criticism of the European Union (EU) -- over its human rights concerns in his war on drugs -- Mr. Duterte also said the Philippines longed to be part of Europe. We’ve been longing to be part also of -- despite the distance -- we have been longing to be part of Europe, especially in commerce and trade all over the world. But there was one thing that really stood before us, and that was the result of the Cold War, the Philippine leader said. Before leaving for Peru, Mr. Duterte said he might follow Russia and withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC). He said this in response to criticisms abroad of his war on illegal drugs, and warnings that he may be brought to the international court because of the rising death toll in that campaign. Mr. Putin, for his part, had earlier signed an executive order removing Russia’s signature from the founding treaty of the ICC, amid international pressure over air strikes in Syria for which Russia has denied responsibility. Mr. Duterte has been critical to human rights concerns by the EU, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and outgoing US President Barack H. Obama, Jr. But he has changed his tone somewhat regarding US president-elect Donald J. Trump whom he has congratulated. Mr. Duterte missed the gala dinner at the APEC summit Saturday evening, sending a message to the hosts that he was sick. Staying put in his hotel may have avoided a potentially awkward encounter with Mr. Obama, who canceled a meeting with him at another summit in September after Mr. Duterte had threatened to swear at the outgoing US leader in that summit. Before meeting with his Russian counterpart, Mr. Duterte first sat down with Mr. Xi and thanked the Chinese leader for your warm hospitality and excellent arrangements extended to us in the Philippine delegation during my State Visit to Beijing. It was a successful visit, which opened a new chapter in the Philippine-China relations and signified our agencies to fast-track mutually beneficial areas of cooperation, the Philippine leader told Mr. Xi. He then invited Mr. Xi: Mr. President, at this time, may I invite you to visit the Philippines at a mutually agreeable date. We would be happy to see you in my country. Mr. Duterte also reiterated his commitment to the Asian power, saying we will find ourselves mutually agreeing in so many things and align our foreign policy towards the development of Asia, strengthening of ties among the countries in the region, with China leading the way in the economic development. The two leaders also talked about the Filipino fishermen who are back in Scarborough Shoal. The Chinese leader assured that the fishermen will continue to have free access to their traditional fishing grounds apart from offering them training such as fish culture to sustain the fishermen’s livelihood and families, Malacañang said in its statement on that meeting. Other topics the two leaders discussed include the agricultural sector and the beefing up of China’s imports of agricultural products. They also talked about the lifting of the travel ban of Chinese tourists to the Philippines, the invitation of President Duterte for President Xi to visit the country which the latter accepted, and China’s hosting of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) Conference where he invited the Philippines as a participant, the statement also read. But Mr. Xi, in his separate meetings with Mr. Duterte and with their Vietnamese counterpart, also said disputes over the South China Sea should be resolved bilaterally, Chinese state media reported on Sunday."}

Asked if Farage expected to attend the inauguration, a source close to the MEP said: Trump’s personal loyalty is such that, whether No 10 like it or not, the relationship between Trump and Farage is unlikely to wither on the vine.The inauguration, which marks the formal transition of power from Barack Obama to Trump, will take place on a stage on the steps of the US Capitol building. Up to 1m tickets are sent out for the event that are colour-coded to denote how close guests will be to the stage: blue, yellow, orange, purple or silver. Obama will be expected to attend the ceremony before being escorted from the White House by Trump and his wife Melania. The event is likely to be held amid demonstrations over sexist and racist comments made by Trump during his controversial and often inconsistent election campaign. Trump’s transition team has rewarded loyalists with posts in the new administration, rather than trying to unite the Republican party or appoint people based on their experience or qualifications. Farage and fellow Brexiters Arron Banks, Andy Wigmore and Raheem Kassampulled off a PR coup by flying to Washington last Saturday to be photographed with the president-elect in front of his gold and diamond-encrusted elevator. May’s attempts to woo Trump have so far reportedly fallen flat. The president-elect left civil servants befuddled during a 10 minute phonecall with the prime minister by extending an unusual and un-presidential invitation to May. At any other time, this Trump-Farage picture would be funny Downing Street refused to deny a leaked transcript revealing that Trump told May: If you travel to the US you should let me know. Rather than a formal reassurance from both parties of the special relationshipbetween the US and the UK, the leaders’ first dialogue has been compared to a casual invitation to a friend, rather than a state visit. The government plans to invite Trump for a state visit next summer, which will allow the prime minister to steal a march on Farage, Whitehall sources said. Meanwhile, Farage’s office confirmed he would stand for parliament again if the South Thanet election was re-held, going back on a previous pledge to retire from frontline politics. Police are investigating whether the Conservatives broke spending rules in the Kent seat at the last general election, when the party successfully fought off a challenge by Farage. The probe could lead to the result being declared void. A spokesman for Farage said he was happy to confirm that in the event of a byelection in South Thanet he would stand again."}

Regardless of policies he is still an ex-Tubbercurry man as far as we are concerned, McCarrick said. Councillor Hubert Keaney responded to the controversial issue after receiving a letter from concerned LGBT citizen Hayley Fox-Roberts. I have not, and do not intend to, invite Mike Pence to Sligo, Keaney told Fox-Roberts in an email. Fox Roberts was horrified to learn that an invitation might be extended to Pence whose support for conversion therapy, a form of reparative therapy that is considered antithetical to the well-being of LGBT people by the American Psychological Association (APA). In the letter which Fox-Roberts also posted to Facebook, she outlined the reasoning behind her reaction: As a member of the region’s LGBT community and a founder member of Northwest LGBT Pride, I cannot understand why a man who advocates for LGBT ‘conversion therapy’, forcible therapy to change someone’s identity, and who speaks hatred, homophobia and transphobia every day, would receive any welcome, she said.

The former Indiana governor has been vocal about his opposition to women's healthcare, having previously cu funding to the clinic while in office.

{"id":240,"title":"Clinton donor got State Department invite — and Bill ","class":0,"body":"The head of a for-profit university that donated up to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation was rewarded with an invite to a high-profile State Department dinner at the request of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Doug Becker, CEO of Laureate International University, got his senior VP, Joseph Duffey, into the meeting of world-class academics at the August 2009 dinner because Becker was someone who Bill likes a lot and his school was the fastest growing college network in the world, Clinton wrote in an email to her chief of staff revealed on WikiLeaks. It’s a for-profit model that should be represented. Roughly nine months later, the university signed Bubba to a sweet deal as an honorary chancellor, paying him $17.6 million over five years until the contract ended in 2015 as his wife launched her presidential run. Analysts said Duffey’s presence at the dinner likely opened doors to the school that otherwise might have remained closed. A lot of these private-education guys, they’re looking to get into events like this one, Sam Pitroda, a higher education expert who was at the dinner, told the Washington Post. The discussion itself is irrelevant. It gets you very high-level contacts, and it gets you to the right people. Bill Clinton made high-profile appearances at some of the university’s 70 campuses in 25 countries, adding some presidential luster to the operation. Becker himself acknowledged the value of the Clinton relationship during a 2010 appearance at a Laureate campus in Malaysia. People know that somebody like President Clinton, the most important thing to him is his reputation, Becker said. David Bloomfield, an education professor at Brooklyn College and the CUNY grad center, said such for-profit schools often leave students buried in debt.For-profit universities have been rife with corruption, using federal student-loan money to fund their operations and often leaving students high and dry, Bloomfield told The Post. A lot of the student debt we read about is students who enrolled and didn’t complete their degrees and found them worthless in the job market.At Laureate’s Walden University in Minneapolis, just 44 percent of grads are making payments on their loans compared with 67 percent nationwide. The school is under investigation by Minnesota education officials. The graduation rate at Laureate’s New School of Architecture and Design in San Diego is a paltry 33 percent, and the average student graduates with $43,417 in government loans. Hillary Clinton also has bad-mouthed for-profits — even though Becker donated thousands to her presidential campaigns. [Students] find little support once they actually enroll, or they graduate and discover that, when it comes to finding a job, their degree isn’t worth what they thought, she said last year. Laureate Education, the Baltimore-based company that operates the schools, has $4.7 billion in debt, according to a filing for an IPO, which has been delayed. And a report by the Senate Education Committee in 2012 found that Laureate devoted more of its revenues to marketing and profit, 54 percent, than the industry average of 42 percent, the Wall Street Journal reported (paywall). The Obama administration’s College Scorecard shows that Laureate’s five US campuses have graduation rates comparable to those of ITT, a for-profit technical school that recently closed down its 140 schools after filing for bankruptcy."}

Donald Trump claimed his place as 45th president, an astonishing victory for the celebrity businessman and political novice who capitalized on voters' economic anxieties, took advantage of racial tensions and overcame a string of sexual assault allegations on his way to the White House. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  WASHINGTON — In an awkward political ritual, President Barack Obama urged the nation Wednesday to join him in rooting for President-elect Donald Trump's success, even as he and his shell-shocked aides prepared to watch a successor undo much of their work. Conceding Hillary Clinton's staggering loss, Obama vowed to do all he could to facilitate a smooth transition and to ensure Trump would be well-positioned to run the country when he takes office Jan. 20. In a brief conversation, he'd congratulated Trump by phone and invited him to sit down together Thursday at the White House. We all want what's best for this country, Obama said. Obama delivered his sunny call for unity while standing in the Rose Garden, much as his predecessor President George W. Bush did after Obama's victory in 2008. It was a symbolic moment meant to signal the calm transfer of power from one president to the next. But it was also a bit of counseling for devastated Democrats. Obama spoke to more than a hundred of his White House staffers, who stood silently, dazed, some crying, before breaking out into a prolonged round of applause that continued long after Obama returned to the Oval Office. Obama made no direct reference to Trump's vows to erase much of what Obama has accomplished. He downplayed the notion that Trump's presidency would mean an about-face for the nation. He said the U.S. has a tendency to zig and zag rather than move in a straight line, and he added, That's OK. Obama remarks were striking after a campaign in which the Democrats declared Trump was unfit to serve and Obama told voters that the fate of the republic rested on defeating Trump. The brief call between Obama and Trump in the wee hours of Wednesday, after Trump claimed victory, was a warm conversation and a gracious exchange, Trump's campaign manager said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans would first target the heart of Obama's legacy, the health care law they have tried and failed to repeal since it was passed in 2010. With control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, they'll soon be in position to virtually gut it. It's not clear exactly how Trump and GOP allies would go about it. But Republicans last year passed legislation that eliminated Obama's Medicaid expansion, government subsidies for insurance bought on marketplaces and some new taxes used to cover costs. The replacement would have increased the number of uninsured by about 22 million, according to nonpartisan analysts. Obama vetoed it. White House officials said they could continue to make the case against repeal as they walked out the door. But they were largely left hoping that Republicans wouldn't follow through on their repeal pledge, once put in the uncomfortable position of taking away people's health insurance. Other parts of Obama's legacy even more vulnerable, largely because he's relied on executive actions. A hefty list of Obama's initiatives rest on regulation, executive orders or unenforceable international agreements the next president is under little obligation to follow. Trump has supported reinstating waterboarding and other extreme forms of torture that Obama banned. He's also vowed to tear up Obama's immigration actions and discard the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal Obama painstakingly negotiated. The Republican has pledged to cancel U.S. participation in the international Paris climate change deal. Withdrawing would take four years under the terms of the agreement, but Trump could also decide to simply ignore its U.S. commitments to reduce carbon emission. Trump has also criticized Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran. But he's suggested he wants to renegotiate it, rather than scrap it. It's unclear, though, how he might persuade Iran to accept less favorable terms. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest tried to be optimistic, arguing it wasn't a given that Trump would follow through on vows to roll back Obama's key accomplishments. I think it is too early to tell what decisions Trump will make and what impact they will have in the priorities that President Obama has so proudly achieved, Earnest said."}

This is our Assembly’s first opportunity to review the outcomes of NATO’s Summit in Warsaw in July, NATO Parliamentary Assembly (PA) President, U.S. Congressman Michael R. Turner said. Turner also welcomed the Nov. 18 phone conversation between United States President-elect Donald J. Trump and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, adding that both had commented on the need to reduce the ongoing disparity in defense expenditure among allies. The United States has adopted a European Reassurance Initiative. Maybe Europeans should adopt an American Reassurance Initiative, Turner noted. In addition, the head of the Turkish delegation, Osman Aşkın Bak, emphasized the important developments regarding NATO’s role in global security, in an environment characterized by more diverse and more dangerous challenges, pointing out that Turkey was in the frontline, particularly in the fight against terrorism. Bak also stressed that this meeting has special meaning for us, by giving top officials from Turkey the chance to share their views on NATO and explain to deputies what happened four months on from the failed coup attempt of July 15. Turner expressed his support for Turkey in its battle with terrorism and its struggle to host some three million Syrian refugees. We are holding this session here in Istanbul as another way to demonstrate our solidarity with Turkey and the Turkish people, and to recognize the trauma that the coup represented, he stressed, noting that the alliance is in support of Turkish democracy. Solidarity and democracy go hand in hand. They are NATO’s shared values, Turner said. However, several members raised concerns over a series of dismissals and arrests of teachers, opposition politicians, civil servants, judges and journalists as well as the military in the aftermath of the coup attempt. We understand a strong reaction is necessary for this traumatic experience, Dutch legislator Salima Belhaj said. However, we are worried about the developments the rule of law is taking in Turkey. Belhaj was among several NATO PA members who quizzed Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ when he met with the Assembly’s Committee on the Civil Dimension of Security. Bozdağ said the authorities were working within the law in responding to the coup attempt. Turkish ministers complained that allies had been slow to condemn the July 15 coup attempt and appealed for more support from the West to help Turkey fight terrorism, bolster its defenses and cope with the around 3 million refugees, mostly from Syria and Iraq. We do not see international solidarity. This is a huge disappointment, Bozdağ said. Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu also said Ankara was playing a key security role on NATO’s southern and eastern flanks and wanted more reassurance measures from the Alliance.  NATO should also keep its promises … so that all NATO members can feel themselves safe and secure on the eastern and southern flanks, Çavuşoğlu told the NATO PA’s Political Committee. That’s why we call on NATO to take action, he added. Lawmakers also adopted reports on Nov. 18 urging the Alliance’s nations to stand firm in supporting Ukraine and maintain a strong stance against Russian belligerence. It is clear that conditions for an improved relationship currently do not exist; that Russia’s foreign policy priorities and the values underpinning these priorities remain in fundamental conflict with those of NATO, said a report adopted by the NATO PA’s Political Committee. Through its actions and rhetoric, Russia continues to unsettle the European security environment and undermine the stability upon which Alliance security depends. it added. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, several senior government ministers and a plethora of security, defense and migration experts will join the legislators over four days for what is the NATO PA’s 62nd annual session."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":246,"title":"The Observer view on the worldwide threat to liberal democracy","class":0,"body":"Democracy is hard work and must not be taken for granted, said Barack Obama during his farewell visit to Europe last week. How right he is. The challenges confronting western democracies as 2016 draws to a ragged close are of a breadth and intensity not seen since the early 1980s, when Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union was expanding its nuclear arsenal and suppressing Solidarity in Poland. Today, Russia under Vladimir Putin is again building bombs and meddling in neighbours’ affairs. But he is not the only or even the biggest problem. Much of the danger to democracy comes from within. Angela Merkel, Germany’s long-serving chancellor, and Obama struggled with this issue during meetings in Berlin that included walk-on parts for the leaders of France, Britain, Italy and Spain. The (Republican) elephant in the room was Donald Trump. Nobody mentioned him by name. But the threat to democratic values and the transatlantic alliance that sustains them implicit in his victory was the subject of a pointed article written by Obama and Merkel, and published in a German weekly. So great is the uncertainty about the political direction of travel in the US and Europe that the two leaders went back to basics, stressing their shared commitment to personal freedom and dignity, which only a vibrant democracy under the rule of law can guarantee. This included joint responsibility to protect and preserve our way of life, they wrote. Today we find ourselves at a crossroads – the future is upon us and we will never return to a pre-globalisation economy. Merkel and Obama were evidently talking about a Trumpist agenda that questions the Euro-Atlantic settlement and Nato’s relevance, mocks climate change, opposes free trade and treats refugees, Muslims and foreigners in general as potential enemies. Their references to pluralism and international law were obvious shots across Putin’s bows. But their message was also directed at Europe. Their concerns are justified. The fear now is that the populist and nationalist insurrections witnessed in Britain in June and in the US this month may be replicated across Europe in coming months, further shredding the west’s liberal democratic moorings. France is of foremost concern. This weekend saw the start of a primary process to select the centre-right’s candidate for two-stage presidential elections next spring. This decision is crucial since the French left is largely discredited. Its leader, François Hollande, is a deeply unpopular president. Should Alain Juppé, a former PM, beat rivals Nicolas Sarkozy and François Fillon for the centre-right’s nomination, as polls suggest, it is assumed he will win a second round run-off in May. It is a dangerous assumption. Conventional wisdom has never been more discredited. Pollsters tread treacherous ground. And Juppé, 71, is very ancien regime. He lost the prime ministership 20 years ago amid a revolt against Jacques Chirac. He was later convicted of criminal abuse of public funds. Last week, Juppé was forced to reject comparisons with the US election. I am not Hillary Clinton. And France is not America, he declared. His protestations will do nothing to quiet the many voices now suggesting Marine Le Pen, the far-right, anti-immigration Front National leader and ardent admirer of Trump and Nigel Farage, has a chance to score another populist upset. It is taken for granted that Le Pen, 48, will reach the second round. But for the first time, the idea she could then beat Juppé, or any other centre-right candidate, and win outright is taken seriously. Manuel Valls, France’s prime minister, admitted last week it was entirely possible. It is a dreadful prospect.France may be part of a trend. If polls are correct, parliamentary elections in the Netherlands in March could see the triumph of Geert Wilders, an anti-Islam extremist who advocates a Dutch exit (Nexit) from the EU. Wilders predicts he will win partly because of Merkel’s stupidity in opening Europe’s doors to Syrian refugees. In Italy, the centre-left prime minister, Matteo Renzi, looks set to lose a controversial referendum on constitutional reform, and his job, next month. Pollsters say the no campaign, led by the anti-establishment Five Star movement (M5S), is benefiting from a Trump effect.Germany has elections, too, next year, which if she stands again, Merkel will be expected to win. But even in Berlin, the electoral balance is shifting in threatening, ugly and intolerant ways as the populist Alternative for Germany and the anti-Islamists of Pegida advance. With Obama no longer around to defend the west’s liberal democratic order, Merkel could be the last woman standing."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":247,"title":"Trump Calls Taiwan President, Upsetting ‘Status Quo’","class":0,"body":"President-elect Donald Trump stepped on a land mine today, when he exposed the facade of America’s One China Policy during the course of his continued phone conversations with foreign leaders, he called Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen. It was the first US presidential call to his Taiwanese counterpart since 1979, despite the US military commitment to them. The call sparked a flurry of condemnation from diplomats who saw the call as upsetting the delicate balance of diplomacy with China and military support for Taiwan against them, and had many warning China might retaliate in some way. The reaction to the call reflects the paradoxical nature of US policy in the region, as there is major trade between the US and Taiwan, and the US is committed to provide for their unconditional military defense and selling large amounts of arms to them annually, but there is no official diplomatic relationship between the two, with President Jimmy Carter cutting diplomatic ties in 1979. US relations, and ultimately lack thereof, with Taiwan are a long and complicated story, starting with the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty of 1955, in which the US government recognized the Taiwan-based Republic of China (ROC) as the rightful government of mainland China as well as Taiwan, and pledging continued support for them. The ROC retained this status, and indeed China’s position at the UN Security Council, and the US had no ties with the Chinese government (PRC) until Richard Nixon’s 1972 visit to China. In 1978, China announced the united front policy with the US, which aligned them against the Soviet Union, supporting US operations in Afghanistan, and attacking Vietnam. Eager to reward the PRC for this move, President Carter cut ties with Taiwan’s ROC outright. Since then, US-Taiwan relations have been very complicated, with no official diplomatic ties. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979 which continued military support for Taiwan against China, paradoxically while the US continues to not actually recognize Taiwan as a government. The US State Department established the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) in 1979, which attempted to circumvent the lack of diplomatic ties by running embassy and consular services through the AIT. The US treats the AIT director as an ambassador for all intents and purposes, and it’s staffed by State Department employees, while retaining the flimsy pretext of not being an embassy. When US-China relations began growing and Taiwan relations were put in this weird state of limbo, the US did not stop or even slow arms shipments to them, and in 1982 President Reagan unveiled the Six Assurances, which vowed that the US would never recognize China’s sovereignty over Taiwan or alter the terms of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. The Six Assurances have been endorsed by every president since, with US officials repeatedly committing America to directly intervene militarily to keep China from taking over Taiwan. Trump’s phone call is being presented as a huge threat to US-China relations because those continue to rest on this bizarre policy of recognizing the PRC and not ROC diplomatically, and supporting the ROC against the PRC militarily. Indeed, the very idea of such a phone call was considered so controversial that analysts are questioning whether it was either an accident by Trump or a deliberate effort to totally upend US-China relations, with Sen. Chris Murphy (D – CT) warning of the phone call that’s how wars start. The White House also warned Trump over the phone call, saying he should seek advice from the State Department before calling anyone else."}

Though presented as the National Defense Authorization Act for 2017, the bill is only a portion of what the US will ultimately spend on the military in fiscal 2017. The bill includes bans on any closure of any military bases by the Pentagon, once again rejecting calls by the military leadership to get rid of costly, unwanted bases, and also forbids the closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. It also forbids the Pentagon from going through with a plan to reduce the number of active duty soldiers, Despite being far more money than the Pentagon and the administration sought, and despite being several times more than any other nation spends on their own military in a year, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R – TX), the Armed Services chair complained that the bill was much too small, and expressed hope that President-elect Donald Trump would push through another major spending bill in the early part of 2017. Subsequent spending bills were expected at any rate, with the current spending caps theoretically limiting just how out of control the spending can get in an individual bill, and Congress having already decided to circumvent that cap by funding the wars only for a fraction of the year, necessitating an emergency supplement be passed to continue wars that no one in this administration or the next has any intention of ending. The bill still has to pass the Senate, which it is expected to do early next week. With the removal of controversial riders authorizing military contractors to discriminateagainst gays and requiring women to register for the draft, the bill is expected to pass the Senate easily, as someone the unsustainable military spending itself is considered completely non-controversial."}

Among these was setting fire to oil wells, aiming to provide a cloud of smoke that would hinder US airstrikes. The fires did that and then some, and Iraq deployed a number of engineers and firefighters to the area back in August to try to get a handle on all these fires. There isn’t much progress to be had on this front, with the fires largely still raging. 19 wells have been set on fire, and three of them have been sealed 100 days later. Getting the rest is expected to take several months, and cost millions in lost revenue. Meanwhile, the smoke is complicating the air war, and also sickening people on the ground. Getting a handle on the oil fires is a very complicated process, and while Iraqi officials tried to predict a quick and simple solution, as always, only to see the effort continue to want for real progress months later."}

Assistant Secretary of the Navy Sean Stackley described the program as having broke the Navy, saying the cost overruns have put the Navy’s program managers under a microscope to ensure they don’t ignore cost overruns in other projects as well. The LCS project’s overruns are virtually unprecedented as a percentage, with per-unit costs just to buy the ships more than doubling from the estimates, and upkeep costs for the largely useless ships to set the taxpayers back another $14 billion, a figure which continues to grow. The Navy came up with the LCS project as part of a quantity over quality push which aimed at having more boats in the water than they otherwise could, intending the LCS to be a low-cost, reliable ship for limited operations around coastlines. In practice, the costs are far higher than anyone expected, the ships have been breaking down pretty much constantly, and even when they get them seaworthy, officials concede they’re so small and unarmored that they have no survivability in combat. Adding insult to injury, the Navy is facing lawsuits over the LCS project on the claims that the design of one of the ships was stolen."}

But the Iraqi military itself is becoming a concern for a lot of the civilians in Mosul, who note that soldiers who have gained a foothold in eastern Mosul have begun spray-painting Shi’ite slogans as graffiti on buildings around the area. The Shi’ite-dominated Iraqi government has not been on the best of terms with Sunni Arabs anywhere in the country, with perceived discrimination providing a big opening for ISIS to set itself up in the area in the first place, and fear that the military is playing a more direct role in that sectarian violence only adds to that concern. Iraqi officials tried to dismiss the concerns of the locals, insisting that the traditional Shi’ite battle cries are just a expression of victory for all Iraqis, and that everybody knows that the military are liberators."}

They went on to say that ISIS could use car bombs in their attacks, or potentially even launch chemical weapons attacks someplace within Europe, as these are common tactics for them in Iraq and Syria now, and they appear to have improved in their ability to launch chemical attacks. The warning of dozens appears conservative, as ISIS has recruited thousands of fighters from Europe, and there have been concerns about fighters starting to trickle back for years. Since European officials have long conceded they don’t have great intelligence on ISIS members going to Syria or return from there, it’s a virtual given that there are a number of them in Europe. At the same time, it’s not clear how practical it would be for ISIS to launch chemical weapons attacks in Europe, as their attacks in Syria and Iraq have been of limited success, and rested on their ability to use empty chemical shells from Syria’s dismantled program, something which isn’t just sitting around in most European cities."}

Iranian officials say they view the vote as a clear violation, and threatened to take non-specific retaliatory actionif the US moves to implement the bill. The White House has already confirmed that President Obama will sign the bill. In reality, the act does not appear to violate the deal in and of itself, as it does not impose any new sanctions on Iran, nor bring any of the suspended sanctions back into effect, rather extending the president’s authority to do so in the future. The confusion is likely a function of many Republican Congressional leaders pushing bills deliberately designed to violate the P51 deal, and trying unsuccessfully to add language to this bill that would add new sanctions as well. In the end, however, the bill itself doesn’t really do anything to Iran, and just leaves open the question of US compliance with the deal for the next decade."}

James Mattis by Wolf Blitzer at Aspen in 2013, in which the recently-retired former CENTCOM commander spoke freely on Middle East policy, has come back to haunt him now that Donald Trump has put him forward as the next Secretary of Defense. At a time when the US has ground troops in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, however, it is not his position on those conflicts that is controversial. It is his remarks on Secretary of State John Kerry’s attempts at peace talks between Israel and Palestine . Alternet quoted him as saying:So we’ve got to work on [peace talks] with a sense of urgency. I paid a military security price every day as a commander of CENTCOM because the Americans were seen as biased in support of Israel, and [because of this] moderate Arabs couldn’t be with us because they couldn’t publicly support those who don’t show respect for Arab Palestinians. Everybody involved in US foreign policy and security knows that aggressive Israeli colonization of the Palestinian West Bank and siege of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip is a major cause of terrorism against the United States, since Washington is blamed for it, and is a major security problem because it makes the US a pariah in the Muslim world. One of the reasons Usama Bin Laden gave for attacking the US was the Israeli mistreatment of stateless Palestinians: ‘ Third, if the Americans’ aims behind these wars are religious and economic, the aim is also to serve the Jews’ petty state and divert attention from its occupation of Jerusalem and murder of Muslims there. The best proof of this is their eagerness to destroy Iraq, the strongest neighboring Arab state, and their endeavor to fragment all the states of the region such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Sudan into paper statelets and through their disunion and weakness to guarantee Israel’s survival and the continuation of the brutal crusade occupation of the Peninsula. ‘ As I’ve said before, if it were a matter of taking a hit to defend Israel on its people’s right to live in safety, then the US will always step up. But to take a hit to defend Israeli wanton war crimes and disregard of international law is unacceptable. In his Aspen interview in 2013, Mattis went on to use the A word: I’ll tell you, the current situation is unsustainable … We’ve got to find a way to make work the two-state solution that both Democrat and Republican administrations have supported, and the chances are starting to ebb because of the settlements. For example, if I’m Jerusalem and I put 500 Jewish settlers to the east and there’s ten-thousand Arabs already there, and if we draw the border to include them, either [Israel] ceases to be a Jewish state or you say the Arabs don’t get to vote — apartheid.

{"id":258,"title":"CounterPunch as Russian Propagandists: the Washington Post’s Shallow Smear ","class":0,"body":"  This past week CounterPunch and other reputable independent media outlets were accused of spreading fake news during the presidential election – stories allegedly fabricated by the Ruskies. The baseless accusations originated from an obscure new anonymous outfit called PropOrNot, which claims that the overall Russian effort is at least semi-centralized, with multiple Russian projects and influence operations working in parallel to manage the direct and outsourced production of propaganda across a wide range of outlets. CounterPunch, they asserted, was one such outlet. Last week Washington Post journalist Craig Timberg used PropOrNot as a primary source for an article he wrote titled, Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘fake news’ during election, experts say. Russia’s goal, the group appears to claim, was to hurt the Hillary Clinton campaign and elevate Donald Trump. While Timberg did not cite CounterPunch directly as a purveyor of fake news, he did attempt to legitimize the group’s bogus findings: PropOrNot’s monitoring report, which was provided to the Washington Post in advance of its public release, identifies more than 200 websites as routine peddlers of Russian propaganda during the election season, with combined audiences of at least 15 million Americans. On Facebook, PropOrNot estimates that stories planted or promoted by the disinformation campaign were viewed more than 213 million times. At no time did PropOrNot contact anyone at CounterPunch during their research. In the Post’s case, Timberg didn’t even bother to phone my co-editor Jeffrey St. Clair for comment, even though Jeff has written for the Post in the past. The whole thing adds up to one big ruse, orchestrated by PropOrNot and promoted, quite carelessly, by the Post.It’s obvious Timberg and his researchers did not conduct a quality background check on PropOrNot, whose practice of identifying peddlers of Russian propaganda is questionable at best. The group, according to The New Yorker, reached out to a number of publications prior to its launch, hoping to snag a little attention. The Post seems to be the only place that took the bait. Timberg, I’d hope, regrets he even responded to the the mysterious group, which claims to be made up of computer scientists, statisticians, national security professionals, journalists and political activists, dedicated to identifying propaganda. Well, they aren’t that good at it. It only requires a quick glance at PropOrNot’s social media presence to see how juvenile their tactics are, which should have raised a red flag immediately about their legitimacy. The group shared this meme on their Facebook page, from a photo taken in 2015 at an anniversary celebration for RT: It’s obvious the group has an agenda – alleging Russia (and Jill Stein, even though she’s spearheading a recount effort?) manipulated the outcome of the 2016 election in favor of Trump.  Apparently PropOrNot doesn’t realize the progressive sites they are going after are the very ones that are committed to holding Trump accountable over the next four years. Then there are childish tweets like this one, which has since been deleted: After a brief email exchange, PropOrNot admitted it was wrong in listing CounterPunch and promptly removed us from their list of Russian pawns. In the initial email to the group I inquired why we were included in their list in the first place and provided them with evidence — a link to an article I wrote which was critical of Russia’s involvement in Syria — that CounterPunch was not in the pocket of Russians, nor were we Putin’s useful idiots. Here’s their response:Thank you for reaching out! Your article above is eminently even-handed, unlike the propaganda we review on a regular basis. Your use of the term pro-Russia left is very interesting, because many of us place ourselves firmly on the left and that motivates a fierce opposition to Putin. Why do you think the pro-Russia left is even a thing anymore? What’s your take on that? Regardless, we will be removing your site in the next day or so, as per your request, and will follow up with you if you have any more questions. Also, we are reorganizing our site and our effort generally to be more narrowly focused in various ways, and are attaching a release which may provide additional context. In further emails, I explained to the group that there were many other media outlets that were not tools of Russian propaganda; Truthout, Truthdig, BlackAgendaReport, Antiwar.com, among others. Here is their reply: If Truthout, Truthdig, Antiwar, BlackAgendaReport, etc, were to reach out to us like you did, things might well end up playing out very similarly to how this one has! We’ve asked people to do that on our site. Several have. Others have not. If someone contacts us and the resulting conversation makes clear that they understand, for example, how Putin’s Russia is a revisionist authoritarian wannabe-imperialist kleptocracy that uses ‘fake news’ as online propaganda, then we have a lot of common ground. That factors into our understanding of the merits, but more importantly, becomes a basis for constructive movement forward. Huh? That isn’t very sound methodology if you ask me, more like a shallow smear campaign manufactured by amateurs. PropOrNot will consider taking these sites off their blacklist, not based on the sites’ content but on whether or not they contacted PropOrNot directly and if they understand Putin is a bad hombre? The group lists these aforementioned sites right along RT and Sputnik News, both of which are openly funded by the Russian government and provide a point of view that’s in line with the Kremlin. It’s clearly a case of guilt by association. For the record, neither Jeffrey or I have ever appeared on RT or Sputnik, we’ve both turned down dozens of requests, in part because we are opposed to state-run media. In fact, both of us have been highly critical of Putin and Russia over the years and we don’t plan on curbing our critiques anytime soon. Additionally, we have gladly published a variety of Russian writers, such as Boris Kagarlitsky, many of whom are harsh critics of the regime. Even so, we don’t believe any American journalists who have appeared on these Russian-sponsored outlets should apologize for anything, and it certainly doesn’t mean those who have are Russian propagandists. Of course, this leads one to speculate whether this blacklist campaign is a government operation or just an insignificant group of befuddled Democrats, angered that Trump knocked Hillary off her perch. PropOrNot assures me they are not funded by the Pentagon or associated with the Hillary Clinton campaign or anyone else. However, The New Yorker reports that PropOrNot provided a preliminary report to staff of Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. [A]fter reviewing our report they urged us to get in touch with you and see about making it a story, the group said. We are not funded financially in any way, and proud of that, PropOrNot wrote CounterPunch in an email. We realize that’s unusual, if not unique, and we’re proud of that too … Some members of our group have extensive experience in the public sector, as well as the private, academic, and non-profit sectors, but we are all acting in our private capacities as citizens. Without the Post giving PropOrNot undue credit, we’d likely have never heard of this shady little group or their work. PropOrNot’s blacklist is not just frivolous, it’s potentially dangerous as it directly discourages dissenting points of view like the ones we provide on a daily basis. Timberg and his editors dropped the ball and it’s our hope the Post issues a mea culpa in the form of a retraction and apology."}

In the website statement, WikiLeaks head Julian Assange chided the German government for launching the inquiry without the testimony of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, whose documents ultimately provided its foundation. Having leaked U.S. secrets, Snowden is still a politically difficult figure for many nations to cooperate with. This substantial body of evidence proves that the inquiry has been using documents from Mr. Snowden and yet it has been too cowardly to permit him to testify.

The letter came with an everlasting gag order, barring Kahle from discussing the order with anyone but his attorney — not even his wife could know. But Kahle did eventually talk about it, calling the order horrendous, after challenging its constitutionality in a joint legal effort with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union. As a result of their fight, the FBI folded, rescinding the NSL and unsealing associated court records rather than risk a ruling that their surveillance orders were illegal. This is an unqualified success that will help other recipients understand that you can push back on these, Kahle told reporters once the gag order was lifted. The bureau continued to issue tens of thousands of NSLs in subsequent years, but few recipients followed in Kahle’s footsteps. Those who did achieved limited but important transparency gains; as a result of one challenge, a California District Court ruled in 2013 that the everlasting gag orders accompanying NSLs are unconstitutional, and last year Congress passed a law forcing the FBI to commit to periodically reviewing such orders and rescinding them when a gag is no longer necessary to a case. Now, Kahle and the archive are notching another victory, one that underlines the progress their original fight helped set in motion. The archive, a nonprofit online library, has disclosed that it received another NSL in August, its first since the one it received and fought in 2007. Once again it pushed back, but this time events unfolded differently: The archive was able to challenge the NSL and gag order directly in a letter to the FBI, rather than through a secretive lawsuit. In November, the bureau again backed down and, without a protracted battle, has now allowed the archive to publish the NSL in redacted form."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":263,"title":" Did the Navy steal the design for one of its new Littoral Combat Ships?   ","class":0,"body":"  The Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship has had a troubled design and deployment history. Development on the LCS began after the Cold War had ended and was intended to deliver a new, relatively small vessel capable of operating close to shore (hence the word littoral). Over time, the goals for the program expanded, until the LCS was expected to field advanced modules that could be swapped out in a matter of hours and allowed the ship to perform a variety of tasks. In theory, the LCS can tackle anti-submarine warfare, minesweeping, surface warfare, and special warfare missions, provided the proper hardware is installed first. Cost overruns, metallurgical problems, and technological difficulties have all plagued the LCS classes, and an ongoing lawsuit alleges that one of the two classes of Littoral Combat Ship currently in service violated critical patents awarded to a ship designer several decades ago. One point of clarification before we dive in. The allegations we’ll discuss apply only to the Freedom-class LCS, which uses a monoplaning hull design. The trimaran-hulled Independence-class LCS is not implicated in the case. The Daily Beast has done an extensive report on this issue and the accusations against the Navy brought by one David Giles, a shipbuilder with decades in the business. In 1992 and 1993, Giles (who owns the company Fastship) was awarded patents on a monohull design that combines semi-planed ship hulls (hulls with a flattened underside) with waterjets that fire water across that flat plane while the ship is underway. The specific ships Fastship envisioned in its patent applications were vessels longer than 200 feet with a displacement in excess of 2,000 tons. Giles’ original goal was to build cargo ships that could hit 38 knots or more, compared to the 23 knots standard cargo vessels average. Fastship was incorporated in 1997 but had trouble finding buyers for its technology due to the high cost of prototypes and, later, the Great Recession. Enter Lockheed-Martin, which did substantial work on the Navy’s LCS vessels. Fastship formed a strategic partnership with Lockheed and handed over its design specs and test data from prototypes the company built itself. Fastship has also testified in court that it shared this information with the Navy under confidential agreements from 1998 – 2000. The original design that Fastship had contemplated was significantly larger than the Navy’s 2003 proposal for an LCS — Fastship’s sweet spot for its technology was a vessel roughly 300 feet long with a maximum speed of 40 – 50 knots and a 2,450-ton displacement. But as the Navy’s LCS concept evolved, the ship became much larger. The USS Freedomis 378 feet long, displaces 3,500 metric tons, and has a maximum speed of 47 knots, which puts it much closer to the type of ship Giles envisioned, as opposed to the far smaller vessel the Navy originally contemplated. Lockheed dropped its partnership with Giles in 2004, Giles first wrote to the Navy about its violation of his patents in 2008, but the Navy rejected his claims. The current lawsuit was filed in 2010 after the Navy rejected Giles’ claims of administrative infringement. Both sides have lined up expert witnesses to argue whether Giles’ patents were or were not obvious (this is common in patent suits) as well as whether or not the current Independence-class design actually violates the patents themselves. Giles recently upped the ante with testimony from Richard Garwin, a physicist who worked on the development of early spy satellites, contributed to early work on spin-echo magnetic resonance (which laid the foundations for the development of the MRI),helped discover algorithms critical to digital signal processing, and helped develop both laser printers and touchscreen displays. If that’s not enough, he’s also widely known as the author of the first hydrogen bomb design (Mike, tested in 1952). Garwin has argued that the improvements made to ship performance by adding water jets were non-obvious to other shipbuilders, and that the government’s other expert witnesses made a number of errors in their attempts to disprove the importance of Giles’ patents. So far, the trial judge has limited the lawsuit to the single LCS ship built before Giles’ patents expired in 2010, the USS Freedom, but won’t rule on whether or not the Freedom infringed on Giles’ intellectual property until early 2017."}

He endured aggressive interrogations at border crossings in some of the world’s most authoritarian nations. But he says a recent confrontation at the United States border has left him shaken. The incident has been criticized by advocates of privacy and press freedom. Mr. Ou, 30, said he was detained on Oct. 1 for more than six hours when he tried to fly from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Bismarck, N.D., to cover the protests of an oil pipeline project near the Standing Rock reservation. He was ultimately denied entry, and he said though he was not given a reason, he was told his name matched that of a person of interest. During the hours of detention, he was asked to describe how and why he had traveled to each country he had visited in the past five years, and questioned about whether he had seen anyone die. Agents requested access to his phones and to look through his photos so that they could make sure he was not posing next to any dead bodies, he said. When he refused, citing the need to protect his sources as a journalist, they took the phones, he said. The phones were later returned and showed signs that the SIM cards had been replaced, he said. Giving up the contents of his private phone would be akin to a doctor giving up confidential patient information, he said. I’m not going to open my phone for any other country, Mr. Ou, a New York Times contributor who was an intern for the news organization in 2010, said in a phone interview on Thursday from Nunavut, Canada. I can’t be expected to do the same for the U.S. Jason Givens, a United States Customs and Border Protection spokesman, declined to comment on Mr. Ou’s case, citing privacy laws. But he said agents had inspected 4,444 cellphones and 320 other electronic devices in 2015, amounting to 0.0012 percent of the 383 million arrivals. Keeping America safe and enforcing our nation’s laws in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully examine all materials entering the U.S., Mr. Givens said in a statement on Thursday. The American Civil Liberties Union wrote a letter to Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security, protesting Mr. Ou’s treatment and calling it harassing and exceptionally intrusive. It demanded an explanation of his detention, and asked for a guarantee that any copies of his belongings had been destroyed. Agents made photocopies of several documents in his possession, including a personal journal, Mr. Ou said. It should have been clear to agents that Mr. Ou was a working journalist who had traveled freely to the United States in the past and had longstanding connections to American news agencies, Hugh Handeyside, a lawyer, wrote in the A.C.L.U. letter."}

Training and analysis team will remain on hand, however. On Monday, a report was released that revealed that Danish planes were involved in airstrikes that killed civilians. Iraqi commanders are analyzing their current strategies in Mosul and questioning whether they should alter them to avoid a war of attrition. Iraqi soldiers are covering up Islamic State graffiti in the newly won neighborhoods in Mosul. However, the use of Shi’ite slogans in the task is alarming many Sunni residents. Sabah al-Numan, spokesman for the U.S-trained Counter Terrorism Service suggested that the soldiers don’t have time to spray graffiti and, also, that the slogans aren’t meant to be sectarian. Although Shi’ite militiamen have so far honored a promise not to enter the city of Tal Afar, who exactly will fight there remains unknown. The army unit assigned to the task, the 92nd Brigade, is composed mostly of former Shi’ite residents of Tal Afar. The International Organization for Migration reports that 77,826 civilians have now fled Mosul. Iraqi forces admitted to retreating in certain districts of Mosul on Friday. Cloud cover has enabled militants to strike without fear of airstrikes, but it is considered a minor setback. Some areas in the city have exchanged hands more than once. Attacks against Iraqi forces also took place in Qabr al-Abd and Qasr. The United Nations announced it will cease reporting on military casualties after receiving criticism from security forces. The Iraqi military, which does not release casualty figures, said the U.N.’s numbers were exaggerated. At least 91 people were killed and 70 were wounded in recent violence: In Baghdad, seven people were killed and 15 more when a bomb exploded at a market. A bomb in the Furat district on Friday killed one person and wounded five more. Three people were wounded in a blast in Camp Sara. Two car bombs in Kanaos killed two soldiers and wounded 29 more. In Mosul, a possible suicide bomber killed 24 people; at least 18 more were wounded. Security forces killed 13 militants. Clashes near Tal Afar, possibly in Tal Zalat, left 13 militiamen and 17 militants dead. An airstrike left 13 militants dead in Qaim."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":266,"title":" Iraqi troops bring to 23 districts retaken in Mosul   ","class":0,"body":" BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi special forces fighting Islamic State militants in the northern city of Mosul seized a new neighborhood on Friday and took full control of a densely-populated neighborhood, where troops happened upon a residential complex for IS fighters, according to two Iraqi field commanders. Lt. Col. Muhanad al-Tamimi of the special forces told The Associated Press his men were now in full control of the Zohour neighborhood, more than a week after they first entered the district. He said his men also captured the neighborhood of Qadissiyah-2, bringing to 23 the number of neighborhoods retaken by the special forces in the eastern sector of the city since the campaign to recapture Mosul began on Oct. 17. Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil of the special forces later told the AP on Friday that his men had taken over two adjacent, two-story houses in Zohour where IS fighters lived. In the garden, they found life-sized cardboard cutouts for target practice, he said. The walls inside the two houses were adorned with posters of RPGs, assault rifles and artillery shells. Some posters had instructions for snipers and RPG users, he said. Flyers bearing the names of the fighters who slept in each room were plastered on doors, he added. Shortly after Gen. Fadhil spoke, the state-run al-Iraqiyah TV network showed footage taken inside the houses, with black-clad special forces searching them with their rifles on the ready. The footage showed metal bunker beds dressed with colorful blankets. There has been some discrepancy over the exact number of neighborhoods retaken from IS thus far, something that Iraqi commanders explain as a possible result of the use of different maps of the city or the exceptionally small size of some neighborhoods. On Wednesday, for example, Gen. Fadhil of the special forces said his men were in control of 19 neighborhoods, which constituted less than 30 percent of the part of the city east of the Tigris River. Most of the fighting in Mosul has taken place in the city's eastern sector, where Iraq's special forces are making slow progress because of fears over the safety of civilians still inside the city and spirited IS resistance. The campaign to retake Mosul is being launched on a multitude of fronts, with forces from the army, federal police and Sunni tribal militias deployed to the north and south of the city. State-sanctioned militias are holding territory to the west of Mosul, but are not expected to enter the mostly Sunni city. Iraq's second largest city, Mosul was captured by IS in 2014 when the militants swept across much of Iraq's north and west. The city is the largest urban center in Iraq still held by IS."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":267,"title":"  Exclusive: Iraqi commanders examined strategy shift to avert Mosul war of attrition  ","class":0,"body":" Facing brutal urban warfare in Mosul and with their push slowed by the presence of one million residents, Iraqi commanders examined changing strategy last week to help civilians leave to give the army a free hand to strike Islamic State fighters. The proposal, a sign of frustration at slow progress in the six-week campaign against Islamic State in Mosul, was ultimately dismissed by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and his generals, military sources told Reuters in interviews. Abadi and his advisers feared that fleeing residents could be massacred by the ultra-hardline militants who still control three-quarters of the city, and that authorities and aid agencies were in no position to handle a mass exodus.But the fact they considered changing a central element of their plan, confirmed by two military sources and a government adviser, at the meeting on Nov. 24 points to growing anxiety about getting bogged down in a war of attrition in Mosul.Islamic State militants who have controlled the city since mid-2014 have waged a lethal defense, deploying snipers, mortar fire and 600 suicide car bombers, as well as attacks launched from a network of tunnels beneath residential neighborhoods.Supreme commanders order us to make advances, and at the same time make sure to give priority to civilian safety, said an officer in the army's Ninth Armoured Division, which is fighting in the southeast of the city.How can we do that? It's mission impossible, said the officer, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.The campaign to take Mosul, the largest city under Islamic State control in either Iraq or Syria, is the biggest ground operation in Iraq for more than a decade, pitting a coalition of around 100,000 Iraqi fighters against a few thousand militants.Launched on Oct. 17, it has already taken longer than the 2003 U.S.-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein, and could yet become the most protracted battle in the 13 turbulent years since Saddam's downfall.At current rates of progress the battle will stretch well into next year, threatening a humanitarian crisis in the city over the winter plus further heavy losses among army ranks.Last week our commanders discussed with other commanders in the joint military operation command the option of giving the chance to civilians to flee Mosul ... to lift the burden from the advancing forces and allow them to engage freely with Daesh (Islamic State) elements, the army officer said. A soldier in the elite Counter Terrorism Services (CTS), which is spearheading the offensive, said that with civilians out of the way the U.S.-led coalition which is supporting Iraqi forces could also step up air strikes.Commanders agree that the move would hasten the military advance, but felt the risks still outweighed the benefits, he said, citing an officer who he said attended the meeting.They instead decided to stick with the current plan, said the soldier who also declined to be identified.Iraqi commanders say they have killed at least 1,000 Islamic State fighters, as they try to roll back its self-declared caliphate which covers large parts of Iraq and Syria.They have not given figures for their own casualties, but the United Nations says nearly 2,000 members of the Iraqi security forces were killed across Iraq last month.The Iraqi army makes no secret of the fact that the battle for northern Iraq's largest city is a greater challenge than any it has faced over the last two years.In previous operations, either in Tikrit, Ramadi or Falluja, there were no civilians ... (we had) freedom of action to use our weapons, operations commander Lieutenant General Abdul Ameer Rasheed Yarallah said.The instructions from the commander-in-chief (Abadi) are for the civilians to stay in their homes, he told Iraqi TV on Thursday night, adding that without that constraint CTS forces would have already recaptured the eastern half of the city.That's why you see a delay, he said.For Abadi's Shi'ite-led government, reassuring Mosul's mainly Sunni residents that they should stay in their homes also sends an important political message that the army is on their side, and that Iraq can overcome the deep sectarian divisions which helped to create Islamic State in the first place.The country's senior Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said the army's treatment of people in Mosul was a source of pride.Sheikh Abdul Mahdi al-Kerbalai, who delivered the Friday sermon in the holy city of Kerbala on behalf of the aged and reclusive religious leader praised the magnificent performance in helping our people trapped in the theater of operations.In the early days of the Mosul assault, authorities also sought to encourage a popular uprising against the ruthless but vastly outnumbered militants. Islamic State responded by executing dozens it accused of collaborating with the army.What we are saying is: 'Our brothers in Mosul, your units are coming. They will liberate you and stay with you,' Yarallah said.A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition said international forces had had no substantive discussions with Iraqi authorities about changing plans.Our position aligns with the government of Iraq, which is that civilians should shelter in place - that's the safest thing, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Dorrian told Reuters.Dorrian also said the rate of suicide car bombings was dropping off, partly because Islamic State - now cut off to the north, south, east and west of the city - had a finite number of cars and bombers, and because air strikes on bridges and roads inside Mosul had limited their ability to get them to the front.This tactic is beginning to lose momentum, he said.So far the CTS and the army's Ninth Armoured Division have captured or cleared about half of the eastern section of the city, split by the Tigris river running through its center. Australian PM says he's confident Trump won't pull out of U.S. refugee dealCuba's Raul Castro vows to defend brother's legacy in final tributeYarallah suggested the battle for the west bank of the city could be even tougher because it was already densely populated, and many people had fled the fighting in the east to the - for now - relatively quiet western neighborhoods. When the army launched its battle for Mosul in mid-October it dropped leaflets over the city seeking to prevent a mass exodus which it feared could complicate the offensive. Stay at home, the leaflets said, telling parents to reassure children the bombardment was only a game, or thunder before the rain. Most residents have complied - either out of choice, or because they felt trapped, or because they feared that by leaving they might lose their homes for good. The United Nations has registered around 78,000 people displaced since the start of the campaign. That figure excludes many thousands more who have fled or been forcibly moved within territory still controlled by the ultra-hardline Islamists. The presence of civilians is not the only headache for advancing troops. Winter rains have started, turning some roads to mud and hindering air support because of the cloudy weather, and not all security forces deployed are trained for war. The armored division officer, whose troops have been battling in the southeast neighborhoods of Mosul, said police units sent to hold ground captured by the soldiers and cover their backs were not up to the job. They are not ready for a real fight. They are only fit to be park guards, he said, adding that an army reinforcement had been summoned from Baghdad. Commanders hope that security forces still stationed a few miles south of Mosul will advance soon and open a new front inside the city, with the aim of stretching the militants' defenses more thinly. Hisham al-Hashemi, who advises the government on combating Islamist militancy, told Reuters there were probably 4,000 Islamic State fighters still in Mosul. The jihadists remain well organized and divided into cells defending separate neighborhoods, he said. But militants in the east had been cut off from the west by air strikes on bridges across the Tigris, boosting the army's chance to make progress. It will be slow and cautious. We're betting that Daesh will have had enough, that their ammunition is being depleted and they cannot resupply because the river crossing is finished."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":268,"title":"  Afghan Security Crisis Sets Stage for Terrorists’ Resurgence  ","class":0,"body":" KABUL, Afghanistan — Afghanistan’s security crisis is fueling new opportunities for Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other extremist groups, Afghan and American officials say, voicing concerns that the original American mission in the country — removing its use as a terrorist haven — is at risk. As intense Taliban offensives have taken large portions of territory out of the Afghan government’s hands, those spaces have become the stage for a resurgence of regional and international militant groups. That is despite the extended presence of nearly 10,000 American troops in the country, tasked with performing counterterrorism operations and supporting the Afghan forces who are bearing the brunt of the fighting. Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the chief of the United States Central Command, said the Afghan government now controls only about 60 percent of the country, the Taliban hold sway over about 10 percent, and the remainder is contested. Which group or groups fill those voids of increasing ungoverned territory in Afghanistan is something we’ll have to contend with, he said. We have to be concerned about this — about the Taliban pulling together and cooperating and collaborating with other terrorist organizations, General Votel said at a security forum in Washington this week. Over all, Western and Afghan officials estimate that 40,000 to 45,000 militants are active across Afghanistan. The Taliban are estimated at 30,000 fighters, some of them seasonal. But the rest are foreign militants of different — and often fluid — allegiances, at times competing but mostly on the same side against the Afghan government and its American allies. Of the 98 U.S.- or U.N.-designated terrorist organizations around the globe, 20 of them are in the Af-Pak region, Gen. John W. Nicholson, the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said recently. This is the highest concentration of the numbers of different groups in any area in the world. It is that situation that President-elect Donald J. Trump and his new security team will inherit. On the rare occasions that Mr. Trump has spoken of Afghanistan, it has usually been to state his desire to withdraw from what he has termed a total and complete disaster. But the most prominent member of the national security team he is assembling, Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency who spent years focusing on the Afghan conflict, has been outspoken about his concerns that the chaos in Afghanistan may again directly threaten the United States. What we have to continue to do for that entire region is to reinstill confidence that we actually can help them, General Flynn said this year. We cannot leave this region to the likes of these multiple terrorist organizations. There is too much at stake. How that debate will play out in the new administration has become a central question among Afghan officials here. The immediate existential threat to the Afghan government has been a resurgent Taliban, who officials say have been killing 30 to 50 members of the security forces each day in recent months. The insurgents are directly threatening important provincial capitals and have again made important roadways hazardous or impassable to government forces. The Taliban, whose leadership is mostly taking shelter in Pakistan, insist that they are focused only on regaining power within Afghanistan. And some Russian officials, including the special envoy to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, have openly acknowledged maintaining some contact with the Taliban as a possible hedge against other militant groups if the government fails, though the officials insist that has not extended to aiding the insurgency."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":269,"title":" He Was a Senior Afghan Government Official. Except He Wasn’t.   ","class":0,"body":"  KABUL, Afghanistan — He arrived in northern Afghanistan bearing certificates of appreciation from the presidential palace in Kabul — a favored token of Afghan officials, second only to government medals. The dignitary, a burly young man with a massive watch, was provided security by Afghan commandos and ushered around in one of the government’s precious helicopters. District governors in Baghlan Province posed with him for photographs; generals clicked their heels together in respect and then gladly extended their hands to receive their certificates. The only problem? The man, who had introduced himself as Sardar Zmarai, a prince and a senior representative from President Ashraf Ghani’s Office of the National Security Council, was actually a serial impostor — a daring con. And after more than a decade of tricking officials and business executives across the country, and growing rich from it, Mr. Zmarai, the son of a wheat seller, had pushed his luck a little too far. At the end of his northern tour, Afghan security agents were waiting for him with handcuffs at the airport in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. The exact date of his arrest, sometime over the past two weeks, was not clear. But the security council confirmed the incident in a statement late Wednesday. He is being investigated at a detention center of the National Directorate of Security, the statement said. Mr. Zmarai, whose latest false identity was as a descendant of an Afghan prince who had served as the country’s first president before he and his family were wiped out in a Communist attack in the 1970s, may be one of the more cunning impostors here. But he is not the first to have benefited from the chaos of the Afghan war. Many have posed as Taliban peace emissaries, sometimes turning out to be suicide bombers on assassination missions. One shopkeeper made it as far as the presidential palace posing as the Taliban’s deputy leader and was rewarded with cash for a willingness to talk peace. Others have made fortunes forging the signatures of senior officials, including that of the country’s vice president to give away prime plots of real estate just hundreds of yards from the presidential palace. On Thursday, some of Mr. Zmarai’s victims laughed at how badly they had been duped. Gen. Noor Habib Gulbahari, the police chief of Baghlan Province and one of the recipients of the certificates, said Mr. Zmarai had introduced himself as a prince and governmental envoy in charge of security matters in the northeast of the country. He gave certificates of appreciation to some high-ranking officials — including the army corps commander, myself and some other officials, General Gulbahari, in a kind of humorous amazement, said in a phone interview. He came to Baghlan from Balkh with a bunch of army commandos, then he called the army corps commander in Balkh to inform him that he had arrived safely to Baghlan. I also talked with the corps commander in Balkh through his phone, and he told me to take care of him. During his stay in Baghlan, Mr. Zmarai was put up in a government guesthouse. When he moved on to assess the security situation in neighboring Kunduz Province, General Gulbahari asked his deputy to accompany Mr. Zmarai in a convoy and provide security for the journey. We did not ask him for any document or ID as he came in an army chopper and with army commandos, General Gulbahari said. He did not ask us for money or anything. A picture of Mr. Zmarai’s broad exploits over the past decade and a half was quick to emerge. Mr. Zmarai, believed to be in his late 20s, hails from Khanabad District in Kunduz Province, according to government officials and relatives who were reached by phone. His father sells wheat in the local market, and his brothers work as tailors and mechanics. Relatives, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they did not want to anger the family, said Mr. Zmarai had made his foray into con work about 14 years ago. He would pose as a government inspector on local projects in Khanabad, luring officials and contractors to give him a cut. But early on, he was arrested twice by the authorities. He tried posing as a senator, going around with a traditional Afghan cape draped over his shoulders. When people would ask where he got the votes, Mr. Zmarai’s family would say that some senators were appointed by the government and did not need votes. Later, he took his craft to the city of Kunduz, the provincial capital. Just doors down from the province’s intelligence directorate, he established an office and marketed himself as a middleman to the NATO military base, where lucrative contracts were up for grabs, his relatives said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":270,"title":" China rescues Filipinos near disputed South China Sea shoal   ","class":0,"body":" China's coastguard rescued two Filipino fishermen from a capsized boat near a disputed South China Sea shoal on Friday, underlining the fast thawing of ties between two countries long at odds over sovereignty. A Philippine coastguard vessel navigated choppy waters to collect the two fishermen from the Chinese ship, in what would be the first time in four years both countries' coastguards were in close proximity in the Scarborough Shoal, a rocky outcrop at the heart of years of diplomatic tension. As we speak, the Chinese vessel is linking up with our own ship to turn over the two Filipino fishermen, said Philippine coastguard spokesman Commander Armand Balilo. It is taking some time because the waters in the area are very rough. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the fishermen were in good health and that efforts were continuing to get them on to the Philippine ship. China will continue to patrol and keep watch in waters around Huangyan Island and faithfully carry out its responsibilities and mission to safeguard the peace, tranquility and order in relevant waters, he said, using the Chinese name for Scarborough Shoal. The rescue illustrates the rapid changes in the relationship between the two countries under Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who in only a few months has sought to turn a historic foe into a friend. He visited Beijing in October and has met twice with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, to whom he has expressed admiration. The last time coastguards of the two countries were both at the shoal was in June 2012, during a protracted face-off sparked by Philippine attempts to arrest Chinese fishermen. That led to the Philippines lodging a case with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which infuriated China and put its claims to most of the South China Sea in the international spotlight. The Philippines won that case in July, with the arbitral award voiding China's U-shaped line of sovereignty on its maps. The ruling made clear the Scarborough Shoal was under the jurisdiction of no country and claimants China, the Philippines and Vietnam were entitled to exploit its plentiful fish stocks. China was until recently overseeing a blockade of the shoal some 124 miles off the Philippines coast, chasing away Filipino fishermen and sometimes blasting them with water cannon. Duterte has told Xi he will unilaterally turn the shoal into a marine sanctuary, banning fishing within the lagoon and restricting it to the peripherals. It is unclear whether Xi will agree to that and how it would be enforced."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":271,"title":" Exclusive: U.S. warns China it will target firms for illicit North Korea business   ","class":0,"body":"  The United States has warned China it will blacklist Chinese companies and banks that do illicit business with North Korea if Beijing fails to enforce U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang, according to senior State Department officials.The tougher U.S. approach reflects growing impatience with China and a view that it has not strictly enforced existing sanctions to help curb Pyongyang's nuclear program, which a U.S. policy of both sanctions and diplomacy has failed to dent.U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave the message to Chinese officials in meetings in Beijing in October after North Korea conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test, the officials said. U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Secretary of State John Kerry stressed the importance of choking off financial flows to Pyongyang during a meeting with Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi in New York on Nov. 1. In response to the U.S. warning, Chinese officials said they believe pressure alone on North Korea will not work, and that they oppose any U.S. action that would hurt Chinese companies, officials said. U.S. sanctions on Chinese businesses and banks would likely exacerbate tense relations between the two major powers, who disagree over China's claims in the South China Sea and the U.S. deployment of an anti-missile battery to South Korea. With President Barack Obama's administration in its final weeks, officials said any major steps would likely be left to Donald Trump's administration, which takes over in January. Though a frequent critic of China, it is unclear whether Trump will pursue the sanctions. The U.N. Security Council, which includes China, unanimously voted to impose new, tougher sanctions on North Korea on Wednesday, to cut its annual export revenue by a quarter in response to the September nuclear test. North Korea has rejected the resolution. We do expect that China will implement the resolution, but if we detect that Chinese companies in violation of the resolution are conducting business, aiding and abetting North Korea proscribed entities, we will tell the Chinese what we know, with the expectation that the Chinese will act on it, Danny Russel, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told Reuters. If the Chinese decline or fail to act, then we've made absolutely clear, not only that we reserve the right to take action on a national basis under our authorities but that we will have no choice but to do so, he said. One option being considered is to impose sanctions on Chinese steel companies that make use of cheap North Korean coal, the officials said. The measures could also target North Koreans who work through Chinese banks. The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday blacklisted individuals and companies it said were helping the North Korean government or its nuclear and weapons programs, but no Chinese firms were on the list. South Korea and Japan also said they would impose new unilateral sanctions on North Korea. Support within Obama's administration for unilateral sanctions against North Korea has increased gradually over the past six to eight months as concerns increased over Pyongyang's growing nuclear capabilities, one official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. If we are serious about leaning on the North, we have to go after the economy generally, the official said. As it turns out, the Chinese tolerance for North Korea misbehavior is higher than ours and that gap is not sustainable. Trump, whose real estate business has had dealings with the Bank of China, has urged Beijing to do more to rein in its neighbor and lambasted China mostly for its trade practices on the campaign trail. He told Reuters in May he was willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program. Neither sanctions, imposed by Washington since 1950, nor the so-called six-party talks with Pyongyang to suspend its nuclear program in return for diplomatic rewards and energy assistance, have stopped North Korea from testing nuclear devices. While Beijing has voted to impose sanctions on North Korea and condemned the nuclear tests, Chinese officials worry that tighter sanctions could lead to the collapse of the government and send tens of millions of refugees across its borders. Pyongyang's collapse would also remove a buffer between China and South Korea, home to 28,500 U.S. troops. In fact, China this year has increased its imports of North Korean coal, one of the North's only sources of hard currency and its largest single export item. Beijing is by far Pyongyang's most important trading partner, and has been its economic lifeline, though there have been signs in recent weeks that it is doing more to squeeze commerce with the isolated country. Sanctions imposed by the United States banish companies and individuals from the international banking system, making it difficult for them to find financing or partners on foreign deals. The United States used so-called secondary sanctions on foreign firms that deal with banned entities to pressure Iran, and the measures were credited by sanctions experts as key to inducing Tehran to compromise on its nuclear program. Such sanctions could serve as a guidepost for unilateral actions against Pyongyang. China opposes unilateral sanctions on North Korea, and is especially sensitive to U.S. measures against China-based firms. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said on Thursday that the new U.N. sanctions are not intended to harm normal trade with North Korea, and that China has always enforced U.N. resolutions responsibly.

{"id":272,"title":"Hong Kong officials widen legal attack on fledgling independence movement    ","class":0,"body":"  Leaders of Chinese-ruled Hong Kong widened their legal fight against the city's fledgling independence movement on Friday, targeting four more lawmakers over oaths taken at a Legislative Council swearing-in ceremony in October. Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen began the action on Friday after lawmakers Baggio Leung and Yau Wai-ching lost a legal appeal over their disqualification, the government said in a statement. The government proceedings seek to declare their oaths purportedly taken as invalid and their office as now vacant, the government said in the statement. Beijing's Communist Party leaders are alarmed about the growing appeal of independence and self-determination in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a one country, two systems formula, allowing it wide-ranging freedoms, a separate legal system and specifying universal suffrage as an eventual goal. The latest move came after Beijing staged a rare interpretation of Hong Kong's mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, in early November to effectively bar democratically elected Leung and Yau from taking office there. Lau and Leung pledged allegiance to the Hong Kong nation and displayed a banner declaring Hong Kong is not China during a swearing-in ceremony for the Legislative Council in October. While their oaths were aborted before they were disqualified, the latest action targets lawmakers who have already taken office. They include veteran lawmaker and activist Leung Kwok-hung, known across the city as Long-hair. The others are younger lawmakers Lau Siu Lai, Edward Yiu and Nathan Law, the government said. The government is challenging the actions of the legislature's president, Andrew Leung, to accept, or allow them to re-take, their oaths. In the statement, the government said it had a constitutional responsibility to uphold the Basic Law and that the action was in the public interest. The government stresses that the decision to initiate legal proceedings was purely a decision based on legal ... consideration, without any political consideration, it added. Senior democratic figures are warning of a popular backlash against Chief Executive Leung, whom they accuse of using the independence issue to wage a legal coup against long-standing democratic forces, on behalf of Beijing. Leung's term ends next year but he has yet to confirm he will stand for re-election in March by a panel of 1,200 largely pro-establishment community figures.

{"id":273,"title":"Obama, Abe hold historic meeting at Pearl Harbor    ","class":0,"body":"  Outgoing US President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have marked the 75th anniversary of a deadly attack on a US naval base, which gave Washington the pretext to enter World War II. The two counterparts, attending a wreath-laying ceremony on Tuesday, paid tribute to the victims of the attack in a memorial site at Pearl Harbor in the US state of Hawaii. Obama said in his address that the Japanese premier’s visit to the site showed the power of reconciliation, also hailing the Washington-Tokyo alliance as very strong. The United States and Japan chose friendship and they chose peace. Over the decades our alliance has made both of our nations more successful, it has helped underwrite an international order that has prevented another world war and that has lifted more than a billion people out of extreme poverty, Obama said. Today, the alliance between the United States and Japan, bound not only by shared interests but also rooted in common values, stands as the cornerstone of peace and civility in the Asian-Pacific and a force for progress around the globe, our alliance has never been stronger. In good times and in bad, we're there for each other, he added. Japan attacked the American military base, Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, which resulted in the death of over 2,300 American servicemen. All eight US battleships at the base were wrecked and four of them sank. The assault marked the United States’ entrance into the war. Japanese attack Pearl Harbor in the US state of Hawaii on December 7, 1941 (file photo) As was expected, Abe declined to apologize in the Tuesday ceremony and for his part spoke about paying homage to what happened at Pearl Harbor, calling it a symbol of reconciliation. It is my wish that our Japanese children, and President Obama, your American children, and indeed their children and grandchildren, and people all around the world, will continue to remember Pearl Harbor as the symbol of reconciliation, Abe said. We will spare no efforts to continue our endeavors to make that wish a reality. Together with President Obama, I hereby make my steadfast pledge, he added. I offer my sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls of those who lost their lives here, as well as to the spirits of all the brave men and women whose lives were taken by a war that commenced in this very place, Abe concluded, noting that he was rendered entirely speechless when he contemplated the deaths of so many. Abe’s visit to Pearl Harbor came seven months after Obama became the first sitting US president ever to visit Hiroshima, which was one of the two targets for America's atomic bombs in the summer of 1945. Back in May, the US president also refused to apologize for the US bombings and only called for a world without nuclear weapons. The Hiroshima bombing on August 6, 1945 claimed the lives of 140,000 people. Some died immediately while others succumbed to wounds or radiation-related illnesses later. Three days after the incident, the US military dropped a plutonium bomb on the southern port city of Nagasaki, killing more than 70,000 people. Many of the survivors, whose average age is over 80 now, suffer from long lasting radiation effects. The horrible impacts of the bombings made Japan surrender on August 15, 1945, bringing an end to World War II."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":274,"title":"Russia accuses Ukraine of sabotaging Trump    ","class":0,"body":" A top Russian official is accusing the Ukrainian government of undermining Donald Trump’s presidential campaign by trashing him on social media and disseminating dirt on one of his close associates. A spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday contended that the Ukrainian government over the summer damaged Trump’s campaign by implicating his then-campaign chief Paul Manafort in a corruption scandal involving a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party funded by oligarchs. Ukraine seriously complicated the work of Trump’s election campaign headquarters by planting information according to which Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman, allegedly accepted money from Ukrainian oligarchs, Maria Zakharova said at a press briefing, according to a transcript of her remarks posted on the Foreign Ministry’s website. All of you have heard this remarkable story, she told assembled reporters. In a follow-up exchange with POLITICO, Zakharova went further, suggesting that the Ukrainian government was intentionally trying to undermine Trump’s campaign by releasing records from the oligarch-backed party naming Manafort. That's exactly what it looks like, she wrote. The renewed scrutiny of Manafort’s dealings in Ukraine comes at an awkward time for the veteran operative and for Trump. As the president-elect works to assemble his foreign policy team, his stance toward Russia and its neighbors is being closely watched by the international community. Manafort, who had been pushed out of Trump’s campaign in late August because of growing press scrutiny of his work in Ukraine in recent weeks has re-emerged as an informal adviser as President-elect Trump has assembled his administration, according to a handful of people around the transition team. And Thursday’s allegation from Moscow also seems at least mildly ironic, coming amid calls from Washington Democrats for an investigation into Russian meddlingin the presidential election in a manner that damaged Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The U.S. intelligence community during the campaign accused Russia of directing hacks of the Democratic National Committee and of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, yielding emails that raised questions about Clinton’s connections to Wall Street and her  The hacking elevated Russia as a major issue in the presidential race. Clinton and her allies cast Trump as the preferred candidate of Russia, one of the U.S.’s top geopolitical foes, citing the hacking, as well as Trump’s ties to Russia and his laissez-faire stance on Russian aggression toward Ukraine, not to mention Manafort’s connections to pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians. Manafort’s work in Ukraine started becoming a more serious liability for Trump’s campaign when the New York Times in August reported that The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine was investigating a secret ledger that listed $12.7 million in cash payments earmarked for Manafort by the party of the deposed former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.While the anti-corruption agency stressed that Manafort’s inclusion on the ledger does not mean that he actually got the money (and Manafort denied that he had received any cash payments) its officials did not challenge characterizations that Manafort was among the targets of their investigation into Yanukovych’s party. But, after Trump’s stunning victory over Clinton in last month’s presidential election, officials with the corruption bureau appeared to backpedal. One was quoted in the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda saying, Mr. Manafort does not have a role in this case. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau earlier this week didn’t respond to questions from POLITICO about its investigation into the Party of Regions ledger, or whether the bureau was investigating Manafort. On Thursday, Manafort told POLITICO that the bureau had never contacted him. I never understood why I was the target, he said. I wasn’t the candidate. I was just caught in the crossfire. Manafort wouldn’t comment on his role in Trump’s transition. But he was spotted at Trump Tower last week, and a handful of sources around the transition team told POLITICO that Manafort has spoken to Trump periodically since the election. They said that Manafort, who spent the last three decades collecting huge paydays from businesses and politicians all over the world, has acted as a sort of informal matchmaker, advising foreign policy operatives on how to join the transition. Additionally, close Manafort associates have worked for Trump’s transition, as well as his inaugural committee. Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, rejected the suggestion that Manafort was playing even an informal role. Paul Manafort has absolutely no involvement with the transition team or communication with the president-elect, she said. Trump’s team did not respond to questions about Zakharova’s comments at Thursday’s briefing, nor did representatives from the Ukrainian and Russian embassies in Washington. Zakharova contended during the briefing that Ukrainian officials were desperate to protect their favorable relationship with the U.S. after having run afoul of Trump — and Manafort — during the campaign. It appears that keeping this sponsorship is a big challenge for the Kiev authorities, who were uncivilized and rude toward President-elect Donald Trump when he was a presidential candidate, Zakharova said, according to the transcript. In her follow-up exchange with POLITICO, Zakharova accused Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko of not making the time to meet with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations meeting in New York in September, though multiple media outlets reported that Trump’s team didn’t respond to a meeting request from the Ukrainians. Trump and Poroshenko did connect after the election, when the Ukrainian leader called to congratulate the president-elect and the two agreed to a bilateral meeting. But Zakharova suggested during her Thursday briefing that there was cause for lingering bad blood between Trump and the Ukrainian government. You probably remember that Ukrainian officials and diplomatic representatives abroad did not express their views or political assessments but openly insulted the person whom the American people elected their president. You may remember that they later tried to delete these statements from their social networks accounts and their sites, saying that they had been wrong and had rushed to conclusions, she said. That appears at least in part to be a reference to since-deleted July social media posts by a recently retired Ukrainian diplomat and Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, Arsen Avakov. In a tweet, the retired diplomat had called Trump a clown and asserted that he was an even bigger danger to the U.S. than terrorism. And Avakov, in a Facebook post, lashed Trump for saying that Putin would not invade Ukraine, despite the fact that the Russian strongman already presided over the 2014 annexation of Crimea, which is internationally recognized as Ukrainian territory. Trump’s assessment was a diagnosis of a dangerous misfit, Avakov wrote, according to one account. He called Trump dangerous for Ukraine and the U.S. and noted that Manafort worked with Yanukovych when the former Ukrainian leader fled to Russia through Crimea. Where would Manafort lead Trump."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":275,"title":" Putin warns artists against 'dangerous behaviour' ","class":0,"body":" Moscow (AFP) - Vladimir Putin on Friday told artists not to confuse freedom of expression with outrageously dangerous behaviour and suggested the Charlie Hebdo massacre could have been avoided if the magazine had not insulted Islam. The Russian President told members of the artistic community not to divide society during a televised debate with theatre and screen star Yevgeny Mironov who voiced concerns about growing restrictions on artistic freedom in Russia. The Russian strongman said there was a very subtle line between what I would call dangerously outrageous behaviour and creative freedom. It's a very subtle thing, a very subtle line. It depends on a feeling of tact, from all of us: officialdom on the one hand and people in creative professions on the other, he said. Those activists -- I'm speaking approximately -- at Charlie Hebdo's offices, they came and shot people. The question is, did those cartoonists have to insult Muslim believers? Putin said of the 2015 attack by Islamic militants on the French satirical magazine that left 12 dead. Officials often act not because they want to block something... many don't want tragedies like in Paris to be repeated here, he said. We must keep this in mind and not let it come to that. Mironov, who heads the Theatre of Nations in Moscow, told Putin in the televised exchange that fears are growing in creative circles over restrictions on artistic expression. Creative freedom is guaranteed by the law of our country and bans can be enforced only through a legal process, Mironov said. In recent months, religious and politically conservative activists have interrupted theatre productions and stormed galleries and defaced exhibits. Orthodox activists this year campaigned to close a provincial staging of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar. Theatre director Konstantin Raikin in October warned of a risk of return to Stalin's times.Last year the director of a Siberian staging of Richard Wagner's opera Tannhaeuser went on trial for offending believers, although the charges were eventually dropped. The Russian arts scene, particularly its lively theatre productions, depend on state funding, making them particularly vulnerable to official decisions and self-censorship."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":276,"title":" Iceland's Pirate party invited to form government ","class":0,"body":"  Iceland’s president has invited the anti-establishment Pirate party to form a government, after the right- and leftwing parties failed in their bids. Guðni Jóhannesson made the announcement on Friday after meeting with the head of the Pirate’s parliamentary group, Birgitta Jónsdóttir. I met with the leaders of all parties and asked their opinion on who should lead those talks. After that I summoned Birgitta Jónsdóttir and handed her the mandate, he said. Iceland held snap legislative elections on 29 October, in which none of the seven parties or alliances obtained a clear majority. The conservative Independence party, which performed best at the polls, initially tried to form a government with the liberal, centre-right Reform party and the centrist Bright Future. But they failed to find common ground on issues including relations with the EU, institutional reform and fishing. The president then called on the Left-Green Movement, the second-biggest party, to form a government. Despite holding talks to build a five-party coalition from the centre-right to the far-left, disagreements over taxes and other issues led the negotiations to collapse in late November. The president then allowed the parties to hold informal talks, which led the Independence party and the Left-Green Movement to discuss terms for sharing power. But the diametrically opposed parties could not find enough common ground. Giving the Pirate party, which came third in the election, the chance to build a government has been seen as a bold move that is not guaranteed to be a success. I am optimistic that we will find a way to work together, Jónsdóttir said. The scandal over the Panama Papers, released in April, ensnared several Icelandic officials and led to the resignation of former prime minister Sigmundur Daviíð Gunnlaugsson, prompting the October vote. With voters keen to see political change, the small and controversial Pirate party had vowed during the election campaign to implement radical institutional reforms for more direct democracy and greater transparency in public life. It won 14.5% of votes, less than pollsters had predicted."}

More than 20 years after the Bosnian 1992-95 war ended, many suspected war criminals remain at large and victims are still being found in mass graves. The six men, who were officials at the Bosnian Serb headquarters in the village of Skelani, are accused of killing civilians, including children, and organized attacks on villages, the Sarajevo-based prosecutor's office said in a statement. In those attacks, at least 40 victims were killed and at least 1,000 (Muslim) Bosniak and Roma victims persecuted from the area of Skelani, the statement said. Bosnian Serb forces, helped by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), attacked Bosnian Muslims in eastern Bosnia in April 1992 with the goal of ethnically cleansing the area slated for their exclusive Serb statelet. Skelani is near Srebrenica, where Bosnian Serb forces, commanded by General Ratko Mladic, killed around 8,000 men and boys in July 1995, in Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two. The killings have been declared a genocide by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Mladic has been on trial since 2012 at the ICTY over the Srebrenica massacre.

{"id":278,"title":" UN appeals for calm after fighting in Libya capital ","class":0,"body":" Tripoli (AFP) - The UN's special envoy to Libya appealed for calm on Friday after clashes between rival militias in the south of the capital killed at least eight people. Tripoli is controlled by a loose alliance of militias of different political and religious factions, and clashes between them are an almost daily occurrence. The fighting that erupted in the city on Thursday continued on Friday, with shooting heard throughout the day as most residents stayed at home. UN envoy Martin Kobler in a statement called on forces involved in the violence to stop immediately and for wisdom to prevail. It is completely unacceptable for armed groups to fight to assert their interest and control, particularly in residential areas, terrorising the population, Kobler said. He said the United Nations was in contact with parties on the ground to urge an immediate end to this fighting. At least eight people were killed on Thursday and Friday, a source at the Al-Khadhra hospital in Tripoli said. Five years after Libya's 2011 revolution that toppled longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi, the country remains embroiled in violence and political chaos as the militias and two rival governments vie for power. A UN-backed Government of National Accord took up office in March with the hopes of re-establishing central power and stemming a jihadist threat from the Islamic State group. It was intended to replace the rival administrations but has failed to win a vote of confidence from the parliament in Tobruk while the Tripoli-based GNA considers it illegitimate. The GNA suffered a fresh setback in October after the rival Government of National Salvation seized key offices in the capital. The reasons for the latest clashes are not clear, but pro-GNA militias late Friday announced the end of an operation aimed at chasing a group of extremists."}

The Libyan forces, backed by U.S. air strikes, are close to taking full control of the former IS stronghold of Sirte after a campaign lasting more than six months. But they have had difficulty dislodging Islamic State from a final patch of land near the city's Mediterranean sea front, partly because of concerns about families or captives still held by the militants. During a pause in fighting on Friday, Reuters journalists saw one woman escorting three young children through an alleyway toward waiting Libyan forces. Shortly after the children were driven away in an ambulance there was a blast as the woman detonated explosives, wounding about a dozen people. Rida Issa, a spokesman for the Libyan forces, said two similar incidents, which he said were suicide attacks, had taken place as other women and children were leaving Islamic State-held ground. Four members of the Libyan forces had been killed and 38 wounded, Issa said. Earlier this week there was a lull in the fighting in Sirte before Libyan forces resumed a heavy artillery assault on Islamic State positions on Thursday. U.S. air strikes have continued, but Islamic State has largely held its ground and even retook control of one row of buildings that had been mostly demolished in previous fighting. As of Thursday, U.S. forces had carried out 470 air strikes on Sirte since starting their air campaign over the city on Aug. 1, U.S. Africa Command said. Issa said field commanders had noticed especially fierce resistance on Friday from one of the buildings still held by Islamic State, and believed that senior militants might be positioned there. Several groups of families or hostages have been freed or escaped from Islamic State in Sirte in recent weeks, some of them migrants from sub-Saharan Africa who were captured by Islamic State as they crossed Libya. The investigation will tell us whether these women were fighting with Daesh (Islamic State), or if they were captives, Issa said of those who got out on Friday. Islamic State took full control of Sirte in early 2015, imposing its ultra-hardline rule over the city in the months that followed. Forces led by brigades from Misrata began a campaign to retake Sirte after Islamic State advanced toward their city in early May.

{"id":280,"title":" Egypt is giant prison, activists banned from travel say   ","class":0,"body":"  Azza Soliman was due to board a plane to attend a conference in Jordan when security officials at Cairo airport turned her away, saying a court order banned her from traveling. The veteran human rights lawyer and feminist was one of at least six activists, lawyers and journalists prevented from leaving Egypt in the space of a week. Rights groups say 217 people were banned from travel between June 2014 and September 2016 -- 115 of them government critics. They see restrictions as part of a wider move by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to silence opponents and erase freedoms won in the 2011 uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule. Soliman said she discovered after being turned back at the airport on Nov. 19 that her personal assets and those of her non-governmental organization (NGO) had been frozen, even though she was not aware of any legal case against her. We are in a state that tramples on the law and constitution. They are acting like thieves in the night, she told Reuters. I wasn't shown a single official paper saying I've been banned from travel or that my assets were frozen. Four days later on Nov. 23, officials banned from travel a veteran activist who runs a center that rehabilitates torture victims and a journalist who aired a television segment critical of the government. Another journalist was banned on Nov. 24 and a prominent women's rights campaigner on Nov. 25. The rash of travel bans prompted a rebuke from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders, who said they were part of an effort to silence critics. Restrictions imposed on...freedom of movement have regrettably become routine in what is seen as a broader crackdown against Egyptian civil society that has continued unabated since 2011, Michel Forst said in a statement. An Interior Ministry spokesman said police do not stop anyone from travel unless a court or prosecutor has ordered it. It is not the airport security officer's job to tell people why they are banned, he said. Airport security officials echoed those points but said that when prominent activists attempt to travel, passport control can consult security or intelligence agencies who sometimes order people stopped. The Interior Ministry denied there was a government crackdown. But Egypt's human rights record is coming under increasing scrutiny, including from close ally the United States. The U.S. State Department's 2015 rights report, released in April, highlighted estrictions on academic freedom and civil society as well as the impunity for security forces who torture and kill. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in March he was deeply concerned by the deterioration in rights, including the decision to reopen an investigation of NGOs which were documenting abuses. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in April Egypt's human rights record made it more difficult to support Cairo. But U.S. President-elect Donald Trump spoke last month of his admiration for Sisi and called the Egyptian president a fantastic guy. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, in a joint statement in November, urged Egyptian authorities to stop imposing the travel bans on human rights defenders. The Egyptian authorities want to sever the connection between the Egyptian human rights movement and the outside world, said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Amnesty said the authorities were using the bans to intimidate human rights defenders and hamper their work. Mohamed Zaree was on his way to a workshop in Tunis in May when he was turned back from the airport. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, where he works, is among several rights groups facing investigation in a 2011 case, accused of taking foreign funds to sow chaos. But Zaree has not been officially charged and received no explanation for or prior notice of any travel restrictions. This whole thing is very Kafkaesque. I don't know why I am banned or by whom, I don't know where to get any official notice, he said, referring to the Franz Kafka novel The Trial in which the protagonist is tried in mysterious circumstances. I feel like the entire country is a giant prison I cannot leave, and I am not sure how long my sentence is.Hundreds of Islamists have been killed and thousands jailed since Sisi seized power in mid-2013, promising stability after a divisive year of Muslim Brotherhood rule. But the dragnet has since widened to include secular activists who opposed the Brotherhood but clung to hopes of political change. Parliament passed in November a law regulating NGOs, which human rights groups say effectively bans their work and makes it harder for development groups and charities to operate. One of its provisions jails NGO workers for collaborating with international institutions like the United Nations without prior permission. Rights lawyers and NGO workers said they now feared the travel bans could be used to intimidate them whether or not they had broken any law. Malek Adly, a human rights lawyer who was banned from travel earlier in November, said he was given no explanation. Part of a legal team trying to block the transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, Adly said he believed he was targeted because of his opposition to Sisi. I was neither given nor shown any official paperwork saying I am banned from travel, he said.

The two Iranian nationals and their Kenyan driver were arrested in a car belonging to the Iranian Embassy on Tuesday. The diplomatic status of the two Iranians was unclear. Tasnim said the Kenyan ambassador to Tehran was summoned on Thursday by the Iranian Foreign Ministry over the arrest and that the necessity for the immediate release of the two Iranians was underlined during the meeting. A Foreign Ministry spokesman denied any wrongdoing by the arrested men, saying they were university teachers in Tehran. The two Iranians are lawyers who had gone to Kenya to provide their jailed Iranian clients in Kenya with legal counseling, spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said. Police arrested them as they returned from a meeting with their clients in prison. Their defense lawyer, Cohen Amanya, told Reuters after the pair's court appearance on Thursday that his clients pleaded not guilty and had been detained by Kenya's Anti Terrorism Police Unit for further interrogation. Iran refuses to recognize Israel's existence. In 2013, a Kenyan court jailed two Iranians for life on terrorism-related charges, including possession of explosives. The sentence was reduced to 15 years on appeal. Kenya has suffered repeated militant attacks in recent years but those were mainly carried out by ethnic Somali militants who would be hostile to Iran because of sectarian differences. In 2002, 15 people died when an Israeli-owned hotel was bombed in the Kenyan coastal town of Mombasa at the same time two missiles were fired at an Israeli jet, narrowly missing it."}

Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky, leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), has been detained since mid-December 2015 after his followers clashed with the army in the northern city of Zaria. A judicial inquiry in August said 347 IMN members were killed and buried in mass graves after the violence. IMN members have held rallies calling for his release and religious processions by the sect have been marred by violence, most recently in the northern city of Kano when at least nine people were killed when police opened fire on worshippers. The U.S. expressed concern at the police's actions. Security analysts have drawn parallels between IMN -- a minority sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim north -- with Boko Haram, the Sunni Muslim jihadist group whose insurgency began in 2009 after security forces killed hundreds of its members and its leader Mohammed Yusuf died in custody. A judge at the federal court in the capital, Abuja, said the IMN leader should be released. The detention of the applicant at Abuja by the respondents since December 14 2014 is illegal and unconstitutional as it violates his fundamental rights to personal liberty, said Justice Gabriel Kolawole. He said Zakzaky's wife, who has also been detained, should be released too. The judge rejected the argument by the State Security Service (SSS) that it was holding him for his own protection from locals in his home city of Zaria. I have not been shown any incident report or any complaint lodged by residents around the neighborhood that the applicant has become a nuisance, said Kolawole. The court ruled that the government should pay the IMN leader and his wife a total of 50 million naira ($164,474) in damages. Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami said the government would need to study a copy of the court's ruling, which it had not yet seen, before reacting to the judgment. Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation of 180 million inhabitants, has a predominantly Christian south and mainly Sunni Muslim north.

The autocratic Dos Santos, 74, became president in 1979, making him Africa's second-longest serving leader -- one month short of Equatorial Guinea's Teodoro Obiang Nguema. His reign has seen the end of civil war and an investment boom, but has also been criticised as secretive and corrupt with Angola's citizens suffering grim poverty as his family became hugely wealthy. National Radio of Angola said that Defence Minister Joao Lourenco would take over as MPLA leader, in news confirmed to AFP by Joao Pinto, a senior member of the party. The president will not be a candidate and he already has a successor, Pinto told AFP. It will be Joao Lourenco, who will be presented to members of the party on December 10 when we celebrate the party's anniversary. At a meeting of the MPLA (People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola) on Friday in Luanda, Dos Santos launched his party's campaign for the election, but he did not address whether he would seek a new term. Our goal is to win the election, he told delegates. The key to success will be the discipline and the unity of all our candidates. - Authoritarian leader - In March, Dos Santos made a surprise announcement that he would step down in 2018, but has since given no further details about any resignation plan. After constitutional changes in 2010, Angola does not directly elect a president, rather the leader of the winning party automatically becomes head of state. In August, Dos Santos was re-elected head of the MPLA, extending his mandate by up to five years if the party wins the election, as expected. The MPLA on Thursday issued a statement denying widespread reports that the veteran leader was seriously ill. Dos Santos has personally directed the work of the MPLA and the state, it said. The MPLA party, which supports the Angolan government, warns all citizens to be aware of the circulation of false information against Angola on social media. Angolan rapper and political activist Luaty Beirao, who was jailed for several months under Dos Santos's regime, said he was very satisfied at the prospect of his leaving office. Angola is the hostage of his decisions and whims and, fortunately, he has decided on his own that this was enough, he told Portuguese news agency Lusa, calling for new faces and new blood in Angola. Beirao and 16 others were arrested last year for acts of rebellion for attending a book club meeting where one of the works discussed was about non-violent resistance to repressive regimes. They were granted amnesty in October in a case that attracted international attention to rights issues in Angola. - New era - The end of Dos Santos's regime will shake up Angola, where he has been a looming presence in daily life longer than most people can remember, exercising almost total authority over government, politics, media and business. He was sworn in 1979 following the sudden death from cancer of Angola's liberation president Agostinho Neto. Both his eldest daughter Isabel and his son Zenu have been spoken of as possible future presidents. Isabel, 43, is a British-educated billionaire businesswoman, dubbed the richest woman in Africa. Forbes magazine values her fortune at $3 billion, based on her stakes in Unitel, Angola's largest phone operator, Portugese oil and gas giant Galp Energia, and in banks in both countries. Also on Friday in Luanda, a trial opened of 37 men accused of planning a coup against Dos Santos in January. The men, said to be former UNITA fighters, are alleged to have plotted armed attacks on the presidential palace and the public television and radio station.

I really fucking hate that shit. Under the watchful gaze of the drone crew, the families disembark from the convoy, stopping to pray at the side of the road. After a brief pause, they get back in their cars and continue their journey, still unaware that they are being stalked from above. Members of the drone crew, satisfied they have a legitimate target in their sights, make the necessary preparations to use force. As the cars trundle down the road, they open fire. And … oh … there it goes! one of the pilots exclaims. The first car in the convoy, struck by a missile, disappears in a giant cloud of dust. Moments later, a second car explodes. People run out of the remaining vehicle, waving at the aircraft above to stop firing. They brandish pieces of cloth at the sky to try and indicate they are non-combatants. A woman can be seen holding a child. I don’t know about this, one of the operators says. This is weird. A total of 23 people were killed in the strike against the convoy, all civilians. An investigation by the military later found that drone pilots ignored or downplayed evidence that the convoy was a civilian one. A transcript of the drone operators’ conversation was later made public through a Freedom of Information Act request by the ACLU. The Uruzgan drone strike and the events surrounding it form much of the basis of National Bird, an extraordinary new documentary about the U.S. drone program. The film, which opened Friday in Los Angeles, profiles the lives of former drone operators, as well as victims of the program, including the survivors of the Uruzgan attack. In doing so, it provides a rare glimpse into the lives of those affected by the U.S. military’s covert global assassination program, as well as the consequences facing those who speak out about it. I wanted to make a film on the drone war and the people directly impacted: those operating the program and those impacted in countries where drone strikes are being carried out, said Sonia Kennebeck, the producer and director of National Bird. We took many risks to make this film, because we felt there is a real need for transparency in these programs. The film profiles three Americans who took part in the drone program but later experienced a crisis of conscience. This is not just one person sitting there with a joystick moving around a plane that’s around the world, its like borders don’t matter anymore. There’s a huge system that is around the world and that can suck up endless data, says Lisa, a former technical sergeant on drone surveillance systems, who, like all the subjects in National Bird, is identified only by her first name. In the film, Lisa shows a commendation she received for helping identify over 121,000 insurgent targets over a two-year period, as part of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is 121,000 lives affected by technology that we control. How many years have we been at war now? The film, beautifully constructed, intersperses scenes from the lives of drone operators living in small American towns with scenes from Afghanistan showing those who have been targeted by strikes. The subjects in the film are cautious in their descriptions of their activities, citing a pervasive fear that they will be charged under the Espionage Act for their whistleblowing. And during the making of the film, a drone operator named Daniel, a former NSA operative at Fort Meade, has his house raided by the FBI and is informed that he is under investigation for speaking out about the program. The Obama administration has been notorious for using that law to prosecute individuals speaking out about the covert warfare programs. Indeed, more individuals have been prosecuted under the Espionage Act by Obama than under all previous administrations combined. This crackdown makes the acts of whistleblowing documented in National Bird even more courageous. I can say the drone program is wrong because I don’t know how many people I’ve killed, Heather, a drone operator now suffering from PTSD, says in the film. Having lost several friends in the program to suicide, she says she is tormented by her role in drone strikes that she believes killed and maimed civilians. She is also consumed with fear that she will soon be targeted for speaking out. If someone comes to my house and puts a bag over my head and hauls me away, what was the point in anything I did? Some of the most moving scenes in the film are shot in Afghanistan, where the filmmakers traveled to meet victims of the program. When your body is intact, your mind is different. You are content, says one man who was wounded in the Uruzgan attack. But the moment you are wounded, your soul gets damaged. When your leg is torn off, and your gait slows, it also burdens your spirit. Sometimes I am so sad, my heart wants to explode, the man says, before breaking down silently in tears. As the Obama administration prepares to hand off its vast, opaque institutions of surveillance and covert warfare to Donald Trump, many have begun to worry anew about these powers. The new president-elect and his cabinet will have unprecedented power to conduct secret wars and assassinations around the globe, thanks in part to programs bequeathed to him by his liberal predecessor. The aggressive posture that Obama took toward whistleblowers also sets a precedent for Trump to step up attacks against those inside the government who dare to shed light on such programs. I made this film in part to highlight the repercussions of future governments holding these powers, but I don’t think many people realize how bad things already are under Obama, says Kennebeck. The whistleblowers in the film took great risks, because they felt that people need to know what is happening inside the drone program. But, over the course of our shooting, the film ended up being as much about the consequences of whistleblowing as it did about the drone program itself."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":286,"title":" What Makes Israeli Apartheid ‘Special’   ","class":0,"body":" Israel and South Africa: The Many Faces of Apartheid, a collection of essays edited by historian Ilan Pappe, takes for granted the validity of the assertion that Israel is an apartheid state.Instead, what this book explores are the similarities and dissimilarities between Israel today and South Africa during its apartheid era. Pappe claims that understanding the historical roots of these commonalities and differences is essential to realizing why Israeli apartheid is of a special type and has been more difficult to overcome. While the book opens with essays that provide overwhelming evidence of the apartheid nature of the Israeli state, it concludes with several essays suggesting why new perspectives are needed to defeat this special type of apartheid.The overlap and differences between Israeli and South African apartheid became apparent in a single year, 1948. That year the white minority South African government proclaimed apartheid (Afrikaans for apart or separate) to be official state policy, establishing laws that rigidly separated whites from the Black majority while claiming 87 percent of the land for whites. The same year a minority settler-colonial population officially proclaimed the establishment of a Jewish state. Israel’s foundation involved the expulsion of 750,000 Palestinians, with the explicit aim of establishing an overwhelming Jewish majority – on more than three-quarters of the land – while rigidly separating itself from the newly created Palestinian Arab minority. South African apartheid lasted until 1994 when Black majority rule was achieved following an international boycott that included sanctions imposed by US Congress. Yet Israel’s form of apartheid persists to this day and Israel is even accorded the status of a special relationship with the US government. Why? The essays in this book suggest that it’s precisely the differences in the two types of apartheid that help account for this persistence. The commonalities have by now become obvious. The book presents overwhelming evidence that both Israel and South Africa violated the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of Apartheid. Approved by the United Nations in 1973, it established a universal definition for this crime against humanity.Both countries were established as settler-colonial states. Both were ethnocentric states, and both created Bantustans or zones of limited autonomy for the oppressed indigenous population. As Ronnie Kasrils, a leading member of the African National Congress during the apartheid era, points out in his essay, South African settler-colonialism sought to exploit the labor of the indigenous African majority while Zionist settler-colonialism sought to exclude and expel the native Palestinians. Apartheid South Africa’s attempt to keep Blacks in Bantustans failed because its economy was dependent on Black labor. Israel, on the other hand, sought to rid itself of the Palestinian workforce on its doorstep. Having established an overwhelming Jewish majority through the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, Israel allowed its Palestinian minority the right to vote. This attempt at visible equality, journalist Jonathan Cook’s phrase in his chapter, helped disguise Israel’s special type of apartheid. Although Palestinian citizens of Israel were able to vote, Cook notes, their vote was meaningless because any Palestinian political party had to accept the framework of a Jewish state and no Palestinian political party was ever invited into a governing coalition. Likewise, some of Israel’s high court decisions have attempted to promote a veneer of visible equality, but Cook offers devastating evidence of the apartheid nature of Israel even inside the 1949 armistice line separating it from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ironically, yet another reason for the persistence of Israeli apartheid lies in the fact that the Bantustan approach, unlike in South Africa, succeeded in Israel, argues Leila Farsakh, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts. Through the Oslo accords signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in the mid-1990s, Farsakh maintains, Israel succeeded in legitimizing the whole notion of separateness, or apartheid, by attempting to frame it in nationalist rather than racial terms. Farsakh details four main ways in which Israel manipulated the accords to impose a Bantustan solution and confine Palestinians in territorially fragmented areas that are unviable economically and politically. Farsakh’s insights set the stage for the concluding essays in this volume which attempt to suggest new perspectives and strategies of resistance that will finally bring an end to Israel’s apartheid system.Steven Friedman, a South African academic, finds the greatest similarity lies in challenging the very notion of ethnocentric states. The Afrikaner elites, he argues, eventually concluded that South Africa could no longer continue as an ethnocentric state. This came about due to the internal contradictions of the South African system and the external pressure of boycott, divestment and sanctions. The ethnocentric State of Israel now faces the same dilemma, Friedman writes, and a two-state solution cannot rescue it. If two such states existed on truly equal terms, Friedman notes, their interdependence would soon become apparent and the perceived need for two states would quickly dissolve. Virginia Tilley, a US-based political scientist, suggests a similar approach in highlighting how international law has both enabled and undermined Israeli settler-colonialism. She calls attention to the UN partition plan of November 1947, showing how the plan aimed to create two states based on ethnic population majorities but also insisted on equal rights in both states. Subsequent UN decisions, notably General Assembly resolution 194, recognized the right of Palestinian refugees to return, effectively negating the notion of an ethnocentric state like the one Zionism created in Israel. Tilley notes that shifting the Palestinian struggle to a framework of equal rights for all aligns it with the approach taken by the African National Congress in South Africa, although she worries that it also sacrifices the Palestinians’ right to national self-determination. The essay by Ran Greenstein – a sociologist working in South Africa – closes the book by examining what the future may hold. Israel’s special type of apartheid, he concludes, is becoming increasingly unstable due to its internal contradictions and external pressure. He points to the growing Palestinian minority within Israel, the ability of its political representatives to unite around a joint list of election candidates, and its democratic vision of a state of all its citizens. Israel’s de facto annexation of the West Bank contradicts its goal of a Jewish demographic majority and further erodes its international support. Greenstein embraces a bi-national solution that he says is likely to come in stages rather than all at once. There is a rich accumulation of material and ideas presented in the 10 essays that make up this book. Yet, as valuable as the book is, it points to the pressing need for additional historical and analytical accounts of why Israeli apartheid continues to elude accountability. -Rod Such is a former editor for World Book and Encarta encyclopedias.

{"id":287,"title":"  One dead in Peru after angry mob tries to lynch pollsters ","class":0,"body":"  One woman has been killed and some 40 people were arrested in a Peruvian shantytown after an angry mob tried to lynch two pollsters whom residents believed were butchering local children to take their organs, authorities said Friday. False rumors on social media claiming dead children had been found with their organs missing fanned mass hysteria in the shantytown Huaycan on the outskirts of Lima, prompting residents to target two employees of a polling company who had been conducting door-to-door marketing surveys, said Police General Hugo Begazo.From one second to the next, people started to surround us, said visibly shaken Luis Nunez with polling firm Quantum in broadcast comments. They nearly lynched us and set us on fire. Police managed to pry Nunez and his colleague from the mob, which then attacked the police station in Huaycan where they were being held for their protection, Begazo said. Police are investigating the death of a Huaycan woman who died from a bullet wound following the unrest late on Thursday, Begazo said. Footage of the clashes showed police launching tear gas at a crowd and firing bullets in the air as people ran screaming and men threw rocks. Begazo said more than a dozen police were injured and that Molotov cocktails were thrown and cars set on fire. The clashes in Huaycan underscore the deep mistrust that often exists between authorities and residents of poverty-stricken areas across Peru where policing is scant and residents regularly band together to fight crime. Peruvian Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio called the organ trafficking rumors irresponsible and designed to instill fear. Those spreading this information will pay the consequences, Basombrio said, without offering specifics. One Facebook post warned Huaycan residents, many of whom are migrants from the Peruvian highlands, to keep their children safe after the arrival of pishtacos, a monster in Andean folklore known for killing people to extract their fat. Other posts said the bodies of children were turning up without eyes or other organs, and with cash or thank you notes left behind. After the polling workers were cornered, someone used a megaphone to summon residents to help punish them, said Nunez. The woman killed was a mother who collected discarded recyclable materials for a living and was not a part of the mob, her neighbors told TV journalists. In 2009, Peruvian police said a group of pishtacos were killing people to sell their fat for cosmetics - a claim they later admitted was false.

{"id":288,"title":" Netanyahu, Lapid Neck-in-neck in Latest Election Poll, Zionist Union Shrinks Dramatically   ","class":0,"body":" Both Netanyahu's Likud and Lapid's Yesh Atid gain ground in poll from Channel 2, pulling mandates away from nearly all parties except for the Joint Arab List, now the third most popular party in Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu's hold of the prime minister's office could be under threat from Yair Lapid in the case of a new election, according to a poll published Friday evening by Channel 2 News.The poll put both Netanyahu's Likud and Lapid's Yesh Atid at an election tie with 25 mandates. Both parties increased their projected Knesset seats since the last poll, though the Likud is still down from the 30 seats won in the last elections. Yesh Atid's extra seats came at the expense of Isaac Herzog and the Zionist Camp, who were Netanyahu's main challengers in the 2015 elections, but have since been in a freefall in polls, with Channel 2 putting them at just 10 mandates in their report Friday. The Likud added three seats since the last Channel 2 pull, seeming to suggest that several controversies currently surrounding the prime minister may actually be helping rather than harming him. Another revelation in the poll establishes the Joint Arab List as the third most popular party in Israel with 13 mandates. Naftali Bennett's Habayit Hayehudi was brought down to 11 mandates in the poll, matching the Zionist Union's loss of three mandates. Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beitienu also lost ground by two mandates, down to eight in total. Shas, Meretz, United Torah Judaism and Kulanu all registered on the poll with 7 mandates, which actually represented a gain for Meretz."}

{"id":290,"title":"The submarine affair gets complicated: How Israeli funds may reach Iran     ","class":0,"body":" Iran Foreign Investment Company holds 4.5 percent of shares in ThyssenKrupp, the company at heart of affair over alleged conflict of interests by Prime Minister Netanyahu. The Iranian government would benefit financially if the German company ThyssenKrupp sells submarines and boats to Israel, an Israeli media report revealed on Friday. The possible deal involves three submarines and several boats (to protect Israel’s offshore natural gas platforms), and has been dubbed the submarine affair given the involvement of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his personal family lawyer in the matter. Yedioth Ahronoth stated that the Iran Foreign Investment Company holds 4.5 percent of the shares in ThyssenKrupp. The state-owned company invests money raised from the Iranian oil industry in a bid to counter the fluctuating price of oil. According to the Israeli daily, Iran invested more than 1 billion marks (then worth $400 million) in ThyssenKrupp during the Shah’s rule. The first investment was made in 1974, with a second one following in 1977 when the German corporation ran into financial difficulties. At the time, Iran held 24.9 percent of the company. At that time, ThyssenKrupp didn’t have the shipyard where Israeli submarines have subsequently been built, concentrating instead on steel, cars and elevators. The companies that make up the current corporation, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, were purchased in 2005. According to the report, at the start of the 2000s, Iranian Deputy Economy Minister Mohamad-Mehdi Navab-Motlagh was on the German company’s board of directors. But in 2003, then-President George W. Bush defined Iran as part of the axis of evil, and America threatened not to sign new contracts with ThyssenKrupp until Iran’s involvement was reduced. Iran held 7.8 percent of the company’s shares at the time, making it the third-largest shareholder. Due to U.S. demands, ThyssenKrupp was forced to purchase 17 million shares from the Iranian company, reducing its shareholding to 4.5 percent. The shares were purchased for 400 million euros, almost twice their value. American pressure also led to the removal of the Iranian deputy minister from the board of directors. In 2007, the value of Iran’s shares in ThyssenKrupp was estimated at 600-700 million euros. Since 2010, all the German company’s business with Iran has been frozen because of the imposition of sanctions due to Iran’s nuclear program. Such business included engineering projects, which generated annual profits of 200 million euros – amounting to 0.5 percent of the corporation’s profits. The German newspaper Handelsblatt reported last week that a source at ThyssenKrupp said the chances of the submarine deal falling through are increasing. Last month, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit ordered a police investigation into the affair. Several weeks ago, journalist Raviv Drucker revealed on Channel 10 television that attorney David Shimron – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s personal lawyer – was involved in Israel’s submarine deal with ThyssenKrupp. Shimron is also the lawyer of the German company’s representative in Israel, Michael Ganor. According to the Yedioth Ahronoth report, Shimron and Ganor have tried over the last few months to transfer the maintenance of naval vessels from the navy’s shipyard to a company to be set up by Ganor. The two met with the Histadrut labor federation leader Avi Nissenkorn and with the head of the union of Israel Defense Forces workers in order to obtain their consent, but apparently failed. According to Drucker, Shimron and Ganor said the navy liked the idea and that the two had also met with the manager of Haifa Port, officials at Israel Shipyards and others. Shimron did not attend all of these meetings."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":291,"title":"UN calls on Israel to leave Golan, Israel prepares fight at UNSC    ","class":0,"body":" The UN General Assembly adopted six resolutions on the situation of the Palestinians on Wednesday, including a demand for Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights. The move comes a day after the new President of the UN General Assembly, Peter Thompson, was seen wearing a Palestinian scarf whilst at a UN committee hearing. The resolution, called UNGA Resolution A/71/L.8, was put forth by over 35 countries, including Bahrain, Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Indonesia, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and the Palestinian delegation, amongst others. The resolution calls for peace talks between Syria and Israel and Lebanon and Israel to be restarted immediately, calls for the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, and determines that Israel being in the Golan Heights and Israel’s de-facto annexation of the Golan Heights represents a key stumbling block to regional peace. It was passed in the UN General assembly by a vote of 103 for, 6 against (Canada, Federated States of Micronesia, Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau, and the United States), and 56 abstentions. The resolution is one of six anti-Israel resolutions passed Wednesday, another being on the status of Jerusalem (A/71/L.22). In it, the UN expressed its determination that any actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem are illegal and therefore null and void and have no validity whatsoever. The representative from Israel said in the assembly following the vote that it was shameful how some countries had yet to accept the existence of Israel and abused the General Assembly to spread baseless allegations, and that the resolutions seek to provide a biased narrative. She continued, saying since 2015, terror attacks against Israelis had claimed the lives of 42 citizens and injured over 600 and yet today’s resolutions made no mention of those victims. Furthermore, the resolutions under discussion did not mention the internationally recognized terror organization Hamas. No one should delude themselves: supporting the resolutions and the inherent bias against Israel would not advance the cause of peace. Rather it would only make peace harder to achieve, the representative added. The US delegation meanwhile, said the US was profoundly troubled by the submission of a disproportionate number of one-sided resolutions that had been designed to condemn Israel. The delegate continued, adding that it (is) manifestly unjust that the United Nations, an institution founded on the idea that all nations should be treated equally, was so often used by Member States to treat Israel unequally. Lambasting the UN, the delegate continued, saying three United Nations bodies in particular reflected the bias and unnecessary costs of such resolutions and wasted limited resources. Costing approximately $6.1 million in 2015, they did nothing to contribute to peace in the region. The US however did reiterate that it views the settlements as a stumbling block for peace. Syria for its part, thanked the member states who voted for the resolution, saying the vote sent a clear message to Israel that its killing, settlement expansion and forcible annexation of land ran counter to international principles. The next round: Meanwhile, the Israeli Foreign Ministry is expecting a tough fight against several anti-Israel resolutions which are due to be voted on at the UN Security Council before US President Obama leaves office. There are three initiatives which especially worry Israel; initiatives from New Zealand, the Palestinians, and France. New Zealand, which will be vacating its position on the council soon, wants to put forth a resolution which will require Israel to condemn settlement construction, condemn violence and incitement from both the Israelis and the Palestinians, condemn the humanitarian situation in Gaza, and call for an immediate re-start of negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis. A draft resolution is expected to be submitted in the coming days The Palestinians The Palestinians are trying to pass a resolution which will term the Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal. Israel is worried that such a decision will prepare the groundwork for sanctions, and be a precursor for an indictment against Israel at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The French resolution calls for an international peace conference, which Israel has already expressed its opposition to. The opposition is premised on the fact that the initiative calls on a time table for discussions, and that should no agreement be reached, France will automatically recognize a Palestinian state. Israel believes that the US will use its veto power over the French and Palestinian initiatives, yet is unsure as to US action towards the New Zealand initiative. This is because the New Zealand initiative does not seem to be unilaterally condemning one side or the other for incitement and violence. While Israel is working primarily with the Americans in the Security Council, Israel is also working with other countries as well. US Secretary of State is expected to discuss the issue at the upcoming Saban Forum."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":292,"title":" The Arabs Did It  ","class":0,"body":" When my parents married in Germany, just before World War I, among the gifts was a document attesting that a tree had been planted in their name in Palestine. My father was an early Zionist. Popular Jewish humor in Germany at that time had it that a Zionist is a Jew who wants to take money from another Jew in order to settle a third Jew in Palestine. My father certainly was not planning to go to Palestine himself. Palestine was then a country bereft of ornamental trees. The Arab inhabitants cultivated olive trees, from which they made their scant living, and at that time the citrus trees were introduced. The olive tree is native – already in the Biblical story of Noah’s ark, the dove fetches an olive leaf as a sign of life. According to popular legend, during that war the Turkish administration cut down the trees in order to build a railway across the Sinai peninsula and dislodge the British from the Suez Canal. However, the British crossed the Sinai in the other direction and conquered Palestine. After that war the Zionists started to come to the country en masse. Among many other things, they started to plant trees in large quantities. Real forests sprang up, though compared with Russian or European forests they were pitiful. The Zionists did not ask themselves why the country was bereft of so many kinds of trees. The obvious answer was that the Arabs didn’t care, that’s just the kind of people they are. No love for the country. No love for trees. The Zionist movement was full of self-confidence. They could do anything they set their mind to. They hated the Palestinian landscape as it was. They were going to create a different country. When David Ben-Gurion, a 20-year old youngster, landed at Jaffa in 1906, he was utterly disgusted. Is this the land of our fathers? he cried out. So the Zionists set out to change the landscape. They imported beautiful trees from all over the world and planted forests wherever they could: along the road from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem, on Mount Carmel and many other places. They were beautiful. The new immigrants did not ask themselves why the country, which had been populated since the beginning of time and remained so continuously to this day, had been so empty of these kinds of trees. Obviously, it was the fault of the Arabs. Actually, the reason was quite different. Palestine suffers from an extreme shortage of rainfall. Every few years or so there is a drought, the country dries up, and fires break out all over the place. The trees which are not suited to this country just burn up. Six years ago there was a warning. A large fire broke out on Mount Carmel. It consumed large portions of the forest and killed 47 policemen, who were caught by the fire while on their way to evacuate a prison. Two weeks ago it happened in earnest. For eight months there was hardly a drop of rain. A strong, hot, east wind blew in from the desert. The land dried up. Any little spark could have started a major fire. Suddenly the land was on fire. About 150 separate fires broke out, many of them near Haifa, Israel’s third largest town. Haifa is beautiful, rather like Naples, and several of its suburbs are surrounded by trees. No one had thought about safe distances or such. Several neighborhoods caught fire. Almost eighty thousand inhabitants had to be evacuated, leaving their lifelong belongings behind. Many apartments were destroyed by fire. It was heartbreaking. The firefighters did their best. They worked around the clock. No lives were lost. With hoses on the ground and light fire-fighting airplanes in the air, they gradually brought the calamity under control. How did the fires break out? Under the prevailing climatic conditions, any little spark could have caused a major disaster. A campfire not properly extinguished, a burning cigarette thrown from a passing car, an overturned hookah. But that is not dramatic enough for news media, and even less for politicians. Soon enough the country was full of accusations: The Arabs Did It. Of course. Who else? TV was full of people who had actually seen Arabs setting forests alight. Then Binyamin Netanyahu appeared on screen. Clad in a fashionable battle-dress, surrounded by his minions, he declared that it was all the work of Arab terrorists. It was an Intifada of Fire. Fortunately, Israel has a savior: he himself. He had taken control, summoned an American supertanker and several other foreign fire-fighting planes. Israelis could go back to sleep. In reality, all this was nonsense. The brave firefighters and policemen had already done their job. Netanyahu’s intervention was superfluous, indeed harmful. During the last great fire, six years ago, on the Carmel, Netanyahu had played the same role and summoned a giant American fire-fighting plane. It had done a good job over the forest. This time, near human neighborhoods, it could do nothing. In settled neighborhoods, the supertanker was useless. Netanyahu summoned it, had himself photographed with it, and that was that. The accusation of the Arab citizens as responsible for the catastrophe was much more serious. When Netanyahu raised it, he was widely believed. The semi-fascist minister of education, Naftali Bennett, argued that the fire proved that the country belongs to the Jews, since the Arabs had set it on fire. Many Arab citizens were rounded up and interrogated. Most were released. In the end it appeared that perhaps about 2 (two) percent of the fires were started by Arab youngsters as acts of revenge. Haifa is a mixed city, with a large Arab population. Generally, relations between Arabs and Jews there are good, sometimes even cordial. The two communities faced the new danger together, Arab villages opened their homes to Jewish refugees from the fire. Mahmoud Abbas, the chief of the Palestinian Authority in the occupied territories, also sent his firefighters into Israel to help out. Netanyahu’s incendiary speeches, making wild (and quite unproven) accusations against the Arab citizens and against Arab workers from the occupied territories, did not catch on. So this political fire, too, was suppressed before it could do too much damage. As the days pass, the accusations recede, but the damage they caused remains. (When I served in the army, long ago, my company was awarded the honorary title Samson’s Foxes. Samson, the biblical hero, attached firebrands to the tails of foxes and sent them into the fields of the Philistines.) The fire should provide food for thought. If Netanyahu and his minions are right and the Arabs are intent on throwing us out of the country by any means, including fire, what is the answer? The easy answer is: Throw them out, instead. Logical, but impracticable. There are now more than six and a half million Arab Palestinians in Greater Israel – Israel proper, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), and the Gaza Strip. The number of Jews is about the same. In today’s world, you just cannot expel such numbers. So we are condemned to live close together – either in two states, a proposal rejected by Netanyahu, or in one state, which would be either an apartheid state or a bi-national state. If one believes, as Netanyahu and his followers do, that every Arab is a potential fire terrorist – how will anyone in the joint state be able to sleep at night? Only some Arabs have guns. Only some have cars, with which to run over Jews. Only some can make explosives. But everyone has matches. Given a dry season, the sky is the limit. By the way, just by chance, this week I saw a German TV program about a Swiss village, high up in the Alps. From time to time, a very dry hot wind, called Foehn, blows over it from the south. Twice in living memory the village has burnt down. All without an Arab in sight. In Israel, the fire brigades belong to the local authorities, providing patronage and salaries to local party hacks. In June 1968, as a young member of the Knesset, I came up with a revolutionary proposal: to abolish all the local fire-fighting departments and set up a united, national fire-fighting service, like the police. Such a force, I argued, could plan for all eventualities, prepare adequate equipment and allocate the necessary resources. Contrary to their habit of heaping abuse on my proposals, my adversaries took this one seriously. The minister in charge acknowledged that it was a good idea, but added that its time has not yet come. Now, 48 years later, the time has evidently still not arrived. Instead, the Great Fire has. Uri Avnery is a peace activist, journalist, writer, and former member of the Israeli Knesset.

{"id":293,"title":" U.S. nation-building in South Sudan: A foreign policy of ignorant arrogance   ","class":0,"body":"  On Nov. 17, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, declared that she would soon introduce a resolution in the Security Council to impose an arms embargo on South Sudan; and, to place travel restrictions and freeze the assets of certain persons deemed responsible for the grisly violence convulsing the new nation. South Sudan was midwifed by the United States from Sudan five years ago. The United Nations special adviser on the prevention of genocide, Adama Dieng, after a recent visit to South Sudan, discerned the potential for genocide. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon warned in a report that United Nations peacekeepers deployed to South Sudan could not diminish a very real risk of mass atrocities. Thereby hangs another tale of the United States foreign policy of ignorant arrogance in nation-building. It is a task for political geniuses, who can be counted on one hand with fingers left over. Republics cannot be summoned into being with copies of the United States Declaration of Independence and Constitution. They require a threshold of common culture, language, religion, customs, ethnicity, history, and education. They require a dispersal of power to prevent any political faction from acquiring sufficient power to oppress or persecute rival factions. They require institutional checks against limitless executive power—which is the earmark of all primitive political societies. And they require time to evolve. A Republic, like a woman, must be courted, not taken by storm. Great Britain needed six centuries from Magna Carta in 1215 to the Great Reform Act of 1832 to embrace popular government. The United States needed nearly two centuries from the 1620 Mayflower Compact and the 1619 Virginia House of Burgesses to the 1787 United States Constitution for a Republic to take root. The 1789 French Revolution created a Republic by storm, but ended with the self-coronation of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte exercising power dwarfing the executive prerogatives of the Bourbons which had provoked the storming of the Bastille. The United States orchestrated the secession of South Sudan from Sudan in 2011 by a combination of military pressure and economic sanctions. It was the de facto senior partner with South Sudanese military strongmen in negotiating an agreement with Sudan to hold a referendum on South Sudanese independence. It passed by 99 percent."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":294,"title":"  The Orwellian War on Skepticism","class":0,"body":" Special Report: Official Washington’s rush into an Orwellian future is well underway as political and media bigwigs move to silence Internet voices of independence and dissent, reports Robert Parry. Under the cover of battling fake news, the mainstream U.S. news media and officialdom are taking aim at journalistic skepticism when it is directed at the pronouncements of the U.S. government and its allies. One might have hoped that the alarm about fake news would remind major U.S. news outlets, such as The Washington Post and The New York Times, about the value of journalistic skepticism. However, instead, it seems to have done the opposite. The idea of questioning the claims by the West’s officialdom now brings calumny down upon the heads of those who dare do it. Truth is being redefined as whatever the U.S. government, NATO and other Western interests say is true. Disagreement with the West’s group thinks, no matter how fact-based the dissent is, becomes fake news. So, we have the case of Washington Post columnist David Ignatius having a starry-eyed interview with Richard Stengel, the State Department’s Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy, the principal arm of U.S. government propaganda. Entitled The truth is losing, the column laments that the official narratives as deigned by the State Department and The Washington Post are losing traction with Americans and the world’s public. Stengel, a former managing editor at Time magazine, seems to take aim at Russia’s RT network’s slogan, question more, as some sinister message seeking to inject cynicism toward the West’s official narratives. They’re not trying to say that their version of events is the true one. They’re saying: ‘Everybody’s lying! Nobody’s telling you the truth!’, Stengel said. They don’t have a candidate, per se. But they want to undermine faith in democracy, faith in the West.  Typical of these recent mainstream tirades about this vague Russian menace, Ignatius’s column doesn’t provide any specifics regarding how RT and other Russian media outlets are carrying out this assault on the purity of Western information. It’s enough to just toss around pejorative phrases supporting an Orwellian solution, which is to stamp out or marginalize alternative and independent journalism, not just Russian. Ignatius writes: Stengel poses an urgent question for journalists, technologists and, more broadly, everyone living in free societies or aspiring to do so. How do we protect the essential resource of democracy — the truth — from the toxin of lies that surrounds it? It’s like a virus or food poisoning. It needs to be controlled. But how? Stengel argues that the U.S. government should sometimes protect citizens by exposing ‘weaponized information, false information’ that is polluting the ecosystem. But ultimately, the defense of truth must be independent of a government that many people mistrust. ‘There are inherent dangers in having the government be the verifier of last resort,’ he argues. By the way, Stengel is not the fount of truth-telling, as he and Ignatius like to pretend. Early in the Ukraine crisis, Stengel delivered a rant against RT that was full of inaccuracies or what you might call fake news. Yet, what Stengel and various mainstream media outlets appear to be arguing for is the creation of a Ministry of Truth managed by mainstream U.S. media outlets and enforced by Google, Facebook and other technology platforms. In other words, once these supposedly responsible outlets decide what the truth is, then questioning that narrative will earn you virtual expulsion from the marketplace of ideas, possibly eliminated via algorithms of major search engines or marked with a special app to warn readers not to believe what you say, a sort of yellow Star of David for the Internet age. And then there’s the possibility of more direct (and old-fashioned) government enforcement by launching FBI investigations into media outlets that won’t toe the official line. (All of these solutions have been advocated in recent weeks.) On the other hand, if you do toe the official line that comes from Stengel’s public diplomacy shop, you stand to get rewarded with government financial support. Stengel disclosed in his interview with Ignatius that his office funds investigative journalism projects. How should citizens who want a fact-based world combat this assault on truth? Ignatius asks, adding: Stengel has approved State Department programs that teach investigative reporting and empower truth-tellers. After reading Ignatius’s column on Wednesday, I submitted a question to the State Department asking for details on this journalism and truth-telling funding that is coming from the U.S. government’s top propaganda shop, but I have not received an answer."}

Though presented as the National Defense Authorization Act for 2017, the bill is only a portion of what the US will ultimately spend on the military in fiscal 2017. The bill includes bans on any closure of any military bases by the Pentagon, once again rejecting calls by the military leadership to get rid of costly, unwanted bases, and also forbids the closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. It also forbids the Pentagon from going through with a plan to reduce the number of active duty soldiers, Despite being far more money than the Pentagon and the administration sought, and despite being several times more than any other nation spends on their own military in a year, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R – TX), the Armed Services chair complained that the bill was much too small, and expressed hope that President-elect Donald Trump would push through another major spending bill in the early part of 2017.Subsequent spending bills were expected at any rate, with the current spending caps theoretically limiting just how out of control the spending can get in an individual bill, and Congress having already decided to circumvent that cap by funding the wars only for a fraction of the year, necessitating an emergency supplement be passed to continue wars that no one in this administration or the next has any intention of ending. The bill still has to pass the Senate, which it is expected to do early next week. With the removal of controversial riders authorizing military contractors to discriminateagainst gays and requiring women to register for the draft, the bill is expected to pass the Senate easily, as someone the unsustainable military spending itself is considered completely non-controversial."}

There isn’t much progress to be had on this front, with the fires largely still raging. 19 wells have been set on fire, and three of them have been sealed 100 days later. Getting the rest is expected to take several months, and cost millions in lost revenue. Meanwhile, the smoke is complicating the air war, and also sickening people on the ground.

The warning of dozens appears conservative, as ISIS has recruited thousands of fighters from Europe, and there have been concerns about fighters starting to trickle back for years. Since European officials have long conceded they don’t have great intelligence on ISIS members going to Syria or return from there, it’s a virtual given that there are a number of them in Europe. At the same time, it’s not clear how practical it would be for ISIS to launch chemical weapons attacks in Europe, as their attacks in Syria and Iraq have been of limited success, and rested on their ability to use empty chemical shells from Syria’s dismantled program, something which isn’t just sitting around in most European ccities."}

{"id":301,"title":" WikiLeaks: NSA eavesdropped on last 3 French presidents","class":0,"body":" WikiLeaks published documents late Tuesday that it says show the U.S. National Security Agency eavesdropped on the last three French presidents, releasing material which appeared to capture officials in Paris talking candidly about Greece's economy, relations with Germany — and, ironically, American espionage. There was no instant confirmation of the accuracy of the documents released in collaboration with French daily newspaper Liberation and investigative website Mediapart, but WikiLeaks has a track record of publishing intelligence and diplomatic material and the release appeared serious enough to prompt an emergency meeting of President Francois Hollande's defense council, according to a presidential aide. The council, meeting Wednesday morning, includes France's top security officials. WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told The Associated Press he was confident the documents were authentic, noting that WikiLeaks' previous mass disclosures — including a large cache of Saudi diplomatic memos released last week — have proven to be accurate. The timing of the release was not accidental: It came a day before the French Parliament is expected to definitively pass a controversial security bill legalizing broad surveillance, particularly of terrorism suspects.  Hollande's office did not comment on the reports other than to announce the security meeting. An aide to Hollande's predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy told the AP that the former president considers these methods unacceptable, generally speaking and especially from an ally. The aide was not authorized to be publicly named. There was no comment Tuesday from former President Jacques Chirac, also reportedly targeted by the eavesdropping. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that the American government would not comment on the specifics of the leak. Obama signs bill remaking NSA phone records program As a general matter, we do not conduct any foreign intelligence surveillance activities unless there is a specific and validated national security purpose. This applies to ordinary citizens and world leaders alike, he said. Ever since documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden showed in 2013 that the NSA had been eavesdropping on the cellphone of Angela Merkel, it had been understood that the U.S. had been using the digital spying agency to intercept the conversations of allied politicians. The new revelations are bound to cause diplomatic embarrassment for the Americans, even though friends have been spying on friends for thousands of years. Late on Tuesday, several French politicians posted messages to social media voicing their disgust with the reports. And one more time we find out that the U.S. has no allies, they only have targets or vassals, Socialist lawmaker Jean-Jacques Urvoas said in messages posted on Twitter in both French and English. House passes bill to end NSA collection of U.S. phone records Hollande said last year that he discussed his concerns about NSA surveillance with President Barack Obama during a visit to the U.S., and they patched up their differences. After the Merkel disclosures, Obama ordered a wholesale review of NSA spying on allies, after officials suggested that senior White House officials had not approved many operations that were largely on auto-pilot. After the review, American officials said Obama had ordered a halt to spying on the leaders of allied countries, if not their aides. WikiLeaks, on its website, listed the contents of what it said were five selected top intercepts of communications involving French presidents — on subjects including a top U.N. appointment, the Middle East peace process, and the handling of the euro crisis — between 2006 and 2012. The site also listed in a chart what were said to be phone numbers listed by NSA as top French official intercept targets, including that of the French president's own cellphone, with some digits crossed out. Hrafnsson refused to comment on how WikiLeaks had obtained the documents and declined to go into specifics about what else might be appearing in the French press, but said that they can expect more revelations in the near future. Privacy advocates and human rights groups have protested the new French surveillance bill, which allows intelligence services to vacuum up metadata in hopes of preventing imminent attacks. But the government argues that it is just updating a 1991 law to grapple with modern threats and has tried to distance itself from U.S.-style mass surveillance. The bill was proposed last year but deadly Paris attacks by Islamic extremists in January gave it added urgency for the government."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":302,"title":" NSA eavesdropped on Netanyahu, Berlusconi: WikiLeaks","class":0,"body":" The US National Security Agency (NSA) tapped a phone conversation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Italian counterpart Silvio Berlusconi, the whistle-blower website WikiLeaks has revealed. In their phone call which took place on March 13, 2010, the two leaders discussed US-Israel relations on an international line, meaning that they failed to follow required instructions to keep the call confidential. This raises the possible scenario that both or at least one of them knew that the conversation is prone to espionage. Following the leak by the WikiLeaks on Tuesday, Italy's Foreign Ministry summoned the US ambassador to Rome. According to NSA’s report of the conversation, during the call Netanyahu asked for Berlusconi’s assistance amid an absence of contact between him and US President Barack Obama. In response Berlusconi promised to put Italy at Israel’s disposal in helping mend [Israel’s] ties with Washington. The call took place after US-Israel relations went cold following the Tel Aviv regime’s authorization of constructing 1,600 new units in Ramat Shlomo settlements in eastern al-Quds (Jerusalem), which was deemed illegal by the majority of the international community including the US. The leaked NSA report noted that Israel has reached out to Europe, including Italy, for help in smoothing out the current rift in its relations with the United States. The document further revealed that the wiretapping was done on Berlusconi’s office and not the Israeli end. Other cables released by WikiLeaks on Tuesday also revealed that the NSA has spied on United National Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s private meetings to save American oil companies. Ban was apparently attending a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss ways on how to tackle climate change. Today, we showed that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's private meetings over how to save the planet from climate change were bugged by a country intent on protecting its largest oil companies, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said on Tuesday. Some of the new documents are classified TOP-SECRET / COMINT-GAMMA and are the most highly classified documents ever published by a media outlet. The new leak puts Italy and Israel beside all the other major countries that are angered by the NSA surveillance programs carried out against them, including Japan, Brazil, France, Britain and Germany. The NSA spying scandal was first exposed in 2013 by former CIA employee and government contractor Edward Snowden."}

After the meeting, the council issued a statement lambasting U.S. spying as unacceptable and declaring that France had demanded two years ago that the National Security Agency stop snooping on its leaders. Hollande spoke to President Obama on Wednesday afternoon as lawmakers across the political spectrum insisted the French president demand a formal apology. After the telephone conversation, the Elysee Palace issued a statement saying Obama had reiterated a firm pledge made two years ago, after allegations of U.S. spying on French officials first emerged, that the practice had been halted. A White House statement said Obama had reiterated that we are not targeting and will not target the communications of the French president. The statement made no admission of prior spying, nor ruled out intelligence-gathering efforts on the French more broadly. We are committed to our productive and indispensable intelligence relationship with France, which allows us to make progress against shared threats, including international terrorism and proliferation, among others, the White House said. The president feted Hollande during a 2014 state visit to Washington, and the two leaders emphasized their deepening ties. The latest WikiLeaks revelations, first published in the daily newspaper Liberation and the investigative news website Mediapart, allege that the NSA eavesdropped on telephone conversations of former Presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy as well as Hollande. WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said he was confident the documents were authentic, the Associated Press reported. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summoned the American ambassador to Paris, Jane Hartley, to his office Wednesday evening to demand an explanation over the spying claims, which sparked indignation and anger in France. These are unacceptable facts that have already been the subject of clarification between the U.S. and France, notably at the end of 2013 when the first revelations were made and during a state visit by the president of the republic to the United States in February 2014, read the Defense Council statement. Promises were made by the American authorities. They must remember and strictly respect them. France, which has reinforced its control and protection measures, will not tolerate any scheming that threatens its security and the protection of its interests, it read. In 2013, documents released by NSA leaker Edward Snowden showed that the United States had intercepted about 70 million pieces of data on French telecommunications. Snowden also revealed that the U.S. had been monitoring the cellphone communications of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. After the Merkel disclosures, Obama ordered a review of NSA spying on allies. Afterward, U.S. officials said Obama had ordered a halt to surveillance of the leaders of allied countries and their aides. The WikiLeaks website listed the contents of what it called Espionnage Elysee (Elysee Spying), a collection of top secret intelligence reports and technical data from five major intercepts of communications involving high level officials from successive French governments over the last 10 years, including the three presidents. Transcripts of eavesdropping on telephone conversations and emails covered subjects including a top United Nations appointment, the Middle East peace process and the handling of the Greek debt crisis as well as the leadership and future of the European Union. One document reportedly shows phone numbers listed by the NSA as top French official intercept targets, including that of the president's cellphone, with some digits crossed out. Other senior officials, including the Elysee secretary general, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, the presidential advisor for Africa and the secretary of state for trade, also had their conversations recorded, according to the leaked documents. A purported intelligence report from March 2010 follows an intercepted communication from Sarkozy expressing his frustration with U.S. spying on France. In another, from 2008, Sarkozy reportedly talks about the global economic crisis. The president blamed many of the current economic problems on mistakes made by the U.S. government, but believes that Washington is now heeding some of his advice, the document says. In the National Assembly on Wednesday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls repeated that the United States’ systematic and continued spying on the leaders of foreign countries was not legitimate, not acceptable and not normal. This information is extremely serious, Valls told lawmakers. It's not legitimate in the name of national interests to carry out eavesdropping — and, no, France does not spy on its European partners or its allies. France will not tolerate any scheming that threatens its security and fundamental interest, Valls added. He said the U.S. now had to make an effort to repair the damage caused by the revelations. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that the American government would not comment on the specifics of the leak. As a general matter, we do not conduct any foreign intelligence surveillance activities unless there is a specific and validated national security purpose. This applies to ordinary citizens and world leaders alike, he said. French government spokesman Stephane Le Foll said a senior French intelligence official was being sent to the United States for talks with his counterparts. The WikiLeaks revelations came just hours before members of Parliament were expected to approve a bill giving the French intelligence services sweeping new powers to snoop on their own people. Critics have said the law would be a threat to individual liberties, but the government argues the measures are necessary after the January attacks in Paris by Islamist extremists.

{"id":305,"title":" Germany Drops Inquiry Into Claims U.S. Tapped Angela Merkel’s Phone","class":0,"body":" BERLIN — Germany’s federal prosecutor said on Friday that he had dropped a formal investigation into allegations of eavesdropping on one of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cellphones by an American intelligence agency because of a lack of concrete evidence. A German news report in October 2013 that the National Security Agencyhad tapped one of Ms. Merkel’s private cellphones prompted outrage among citizens already angry over previous reports of the widespread gathering of telecommunications data by United States and British intelligence services. After coming under pressure from Parliament and the news media, the federal prosecutor, Harald Range, opened a formal investigation last June into the allegations. The inquiry was largely based on a document uncovered by the news weekly Der Spiegel that suggested the United States had been listening in on the chancellor’s communications, possibly since 2002. But Mr. Range said in a statement on Friday that investigators had not been able to prove that the document was an authentic eavesdropping order from the N.S.A., or another U.S. intelligence agency, or that it concretely showed the chancellor’s phone had been tapped. It was possible to determine that the telephone number listed is assigned to a mobile telephone used by the chancellor, Mr. Range said. The data on the document otherwise remain open to various interpretations. The allegations of eavesdropping by the N.S.A. and other intelligence agencies have remained a source of conflict in trans-Atlantic relations, despite assurances from the White House that Ms. Merkel was not being spied on at the time of the report and would not be the subject of surveillance in the future — a response that pointedly omitted anything about the past. The vague remarks from U.S. officials about U.S. intelligence surveillance of the chancellor’s cellphone — i.e. ‘not any more’ — are insufficient evidence, the prosecutor said, noting they were taken by the public as a general admission of guilt by Washington. Attempts to obtain original documents or further details from the United States were not successful, he said, leaving German investigators to rely largely on testimony from their own intelligence services. Clarification of the suspected crime, time it took place, location and circumstances, as well as the people involved — all required in a code of criminal procedure — were not obtainable in this fashion, the prosecutor said. A special investigative committee of the German Parliament has been looking into the extent of the spying, which has widened to include allegations that the country’s own foreign intelligence service cooperated with allies and accusations of economic espionage by the Americans against leading German and European companies. Mr. Range further stated that documents released by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor who unveiled the scope of the agency’s international data collection efforts, do not contain any concrete evidence of surveillance of the mobile telephone used by the chancellor. Although Ms. Merkel’s name appears to have been searched more than 300 times through a program called Nymrod, there was no evidence that the data gathered had come from one of her phones, Mr. Range said. Investigators are continuing to examine whether American and British intelligence agencies eavesdropped on the telecommunications data of German citizens, the prosecutor said. The chancellor did not raise the topic during President Obama’s visit to Germany for the Group of 7 summit meeting this week, and on Tuesday, she urged German companies to move beyond their fear of big data. Whoever sees data as a threat, whoever thinks about every piece of data in terms of what bad can be done with it, will not be able to take advantage of the opportunity of digitization, Ms. Merkel told a gathering of midsize and family-owned companies."}

{"id":307,"title":" Israel Eavesdropped on John Kerry in Mideast Talks","class":0,"body":" SPIEGEL has learned from reliable sources that Israeli intelligence eavesdropped on US Secretary of State John Kerry during Middle East peace negotiations. In addition to the Israelis, at least one other intelligence service also listened in as Kerry mediated last year between Israel, the Palestinians and the Arab states, several intelligence service sources told SPIEGEL. Revelations of the eavesdropping could further damage already tense relations between the US government and Israel. During the peak stage of peace talks last year, Kerry spoke regularly with high-ranking negotiating partners in the Middle East. At the time, some of these calls were not made on encrypted equipment, but instead on normal telephones, with the conversations transmitted by satellite. Intelligence agencies intercepted some of those calls. The government in Jerusalem then used the information obtained in international negotiations aiming to reach a diplomatic solution in the Middle East. In the current Gaza conflict, the Israelis have massively criticized Kerry, with a few ministers indirectly calling on him to withdraw from peace talks. Both the US State Department and the Israeli authorities declined to comment. Only one week ago, Kerry flew to Israel to mediate between the conflict parties, but the Israelis brusquely rejected a draft proposal for a cease-fire. The plan reportedly didn't include any language demanding that Hamas abandon its rocket arsenal and destroy its tunnel system. Last year, Kerry undertook intensive diplomatic efforts to seek a solution in the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but they ultimately failed. Since those talks, relations between Kerry and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been tense. Still, there are no doubts about fundamental support for Israel on the part of the United States. On Friday, the US Congress voted to help fund Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system to the tune of $225 million (around €168 million)."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":308,"title":" Canada police eavesdropped on BlackBerry messages: media","class":0,"body":" OTTAWA, Canada (AFP) — Canadian federal police have been able to eavesdrop on messages sent between BlackBerry smartphones since at least 2010 using an encryption key it obtained, according to an online news magazine. The revelation was made in court documents obtained by Vice and its sister publication Motherboard. The technical files submitted to the court by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police relate to surveillance of Montreal crime syndicates as part of a 2011 gangland murder probe. Law enforcement intercepted and decrypted about one million BlackBerry messages in connection with the investigation, Vice said in its report Thursday. The suspects in the case all pleaded guilty. Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry declined to comment to AFP on the story. It is believed that corporate and government users of BlackBerry devices are not impacted, since each has control over its own key on its servers. In the court filings cited by Vice, the RCMP said the key could be used to break the encryption on virtually any BlackBerry message sent from one device to another without the user's knowledge. It was not known how authorities obtained the key. It was also unclear whether BlackBerry has changed the encryption code since the trial."}

{"id":310,"title":" WikiLeaks: U.S. wiretapped French presidents","class":0,"body":" The United States has wiretapped the last three presidents of France, including current leader Francois Hollande as recently as 2012, according to WikiLeaks documents disclosed Tuesday. Documents said the United States eavesdropped on presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac as well as Hollande on issues that included the French positions on EuroZone economic policy, United Nations appointments, Middle East peace talks and the financial crisis of 2008. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price declined to comment on the French reports, but said: We are not targeting and will not target the communications of President Hollande We work closely with France on all matters of international concern, and the French are indispensable partners. Price added: We do not conduct any foreign intelligence surveillance activities unless there is a specific and validated national security purpose. This applies to ordinary citizens and world leaders alike. Hollande was holding an emergency meeting with French security officials over the documents Wednesday. The French newspaper Liberation and the investigative website Mediapart reprinted documents that go back to 2006, when George W. Bush served as president. Previous disclosures of U.S. National Security Agency intelligence-gathering activities have triggered diplomatic rifts with other countries, including Germany and Brazil. The most recent French document, from May of 2012, disclosed Hollande's concern thatGreece might leave the European Union, and leave behind economic damage. The French president seems worried that if word were to get out that Paris is seriously considering the possibility of a Greek exit, it would deepen the crisis, the document said. The report also said that Hollande expressed disappointment over his talks with German Chancellor Merkel, and sought secret meetings with minority members of her governing coalition. Hollande has said that he has discussed his concerns about NSA surveillance with President Obama. A document from June 2011 cited an effort by Hollande's predecessor, Sarkozy, to go forward with an initiative to restart direct Mideast peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. A report from 2008, during the Bush presidency, said Sarkozy considers it his responsibility to Europe and the world to step up to the plate and resolve the world financial crisis. It added that the French president blamed many of the current economic problems on mistakes made by the U.S. Government, but believes that Washington is now heeding some of his advice. The oldest document, from 2006, details Chirac's efforts to secure a major U.N. appointment for an ally. WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told The Associated Press he is confident the documents are authentic. Previous disclosures of U.S. intelligence-gathering activities have triggered diplomatic rifts with other countries, including Germany and Brazil. After reports that the U.S. had tapped the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel — according to documents leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden — Obama ordered a review of surveillance activities. Obama has reportedly ordered a halt to spying on the leaders of friendly countries (though not their aides). A newly leaked document from 2010 reveals potential topics of discussion for a meeting between Sarkozy and Obama — including U.S. intelligence gathering. The report said Sarkozy will express his frustration that Washington has backed away from its proposed bilateral intelligence cooperation agreement and Sarkozy intends to continue to push for closure. As (French officials) understand it, the main sticking point is the U.S. desire to continue spying on France."}

Bush Admits Authorizing NSA to Eavesdrop on Americans Without Court Approval ","class":0,"body":" President Bush has admitted he secretly ordered the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans without ever seeking court approval. Famed constitutional attorney Martin Garbus and former intelligence officer Christopher Pyle both say it is an impeachable offense. We also speak with investigative journalist James Bamford about the history of the NSA. Plus, The New York Times exposed the story, but why did they hold it for more than a year? [includes rush transcript] President Bush has admitted he secretly ordered the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans without ever seeking constitutionally-required court approved warrants. Under the program — authorized in the weeks following the 9/11 attacks — the agency has monitored the international phone calls and e-mails of hundreds — and possibly thousands — of people inside the country. The New York Times broke the story Friday. Hours later, Bush was interviewed by PBS’ Jim Lehrer. President Bush, interviewed on PBS’ NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, December 16, 2005.

But less than twenty-hours later, after a storm of public criticism, he reversed his position. This is President Bush, in his weekly radio address Saturday. President Bush, radio address, December 17, 2005. The disclosure has led to bi-partisan calls for a congressional investigation. In response, administration officials pointed out both Democratic and Republican congressional leaders had been briefed on the program. But former Democratic Senator Bob Graham, who attended the briefings as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Washington Post he was never informed of the two key issues to arise from the disclosure. Graham says he was never told the government was eavesdropping on U.S. citizens and foreign nationals in the country, nor was he told it was bypassing the special courts imposed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. Under FISA, the government can obtain warrants directly from a special court that requires almost no evidence or probable cause. Passed by Congress in late 1970s, FISA describes it itself and the criminal wiretap statutes as the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance . . . may be conducted. Several analysts have questioned the administration’s decision to not seek court-approved warrants when FISA courts have almost never rejected them. According to the Electronic Privacy Information Center, FISA courts have rejected only FOUR of over 15,000 warrant requests made since 1979. That number includes over 4,000 warrant requests since the 9/11 attacks. The Washington Post notes the revelation marks the third time in as many months the Bush administration has been forced to defend a departure from previous restraints on domestic surveillance. Most recently, NBC News reported last week the Pentagon has been conducting domestic intelligence on peaceful anti-war protesters and others. But the revelation also marks the second time in as many months one of the country’s leading newspapers has withheld information at the request of the Bush administration. In a November piece on the existence of CIA-run, Soviet-era prisons in Eastern Europe, the Washington Post complied with a White House request to withhold information administration officials said could be harmful to national security. In its report Friday, the New York Times revealed it had not only withheld information, but had in fact delayed publishing the story — also at the government’s request–for at least one year.

BUSH: We do not discuss ongoing intelligence operations to protect the country. And the reason why is that there’s an enemy that lurks that would like to know exactly what we’re trying to do to stop them. I will make this point, that whatever I do to protect the American people — and I have an obligation to do so — that we will uphold the law, and decisions made are made understanding we have an obligation to protect the civil liberties of the American people. JIM LEHRER: So, if, in fact, these things did occur, they were done legally and properly. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: See, you’re trying to get me to talk about a program that’s important not to talk about, and the reason why is that we’re at war with an enemy that still wants to attack. I — after 9/11, I told the American people I would do everything in my power to protect the country, within the law. And that’s exactly how I conduct my presidency.

In its report Friday, The New York Times revealed it had not only withheld information, but had in fact delayed publishing the story also at the government’s request for more than a year. To discuss this explosive story, we’re joined by Martin Garbus, partner in the law firm, Davis & Gilbert. Time magazine calls him one of the best trial lawyers in the country, while the National Law Journal has named him one of the country’s top ten litigators. We’re also joined in our D.C. studio by James Bamford. He is author of several books, including the first book ever written about the National Security Agency called The Puzzle Palace: Inside America’s Most Secret Intelligence Organization, also author of Body of Secrets: Anatomoy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency, and most recently, A Pretext for War. And joining us on the phone from Massachusetts is Christopher Pyle. In 1970, Pyle disclosed the military surveillance of civilian politics and helped to end that practice. He is a former military intelligence officer. Let’s begin with Jim Bamford in Washington. Can you talk about precisely what has been revealed? What exactly is the National Security Agency doing, Jim? JAMES BAMFORD: Well, there hasn’t really been very much revealed at all, simply the fact that the Bush administration has admitted that they have been eavesdropping on U.S. citizens within the United States, and apparently, they were focusing on international communications; in other words, where at least one of the terminals of the phone call was outside the United States. So that’s about all we know right now. The New York Times indicated that there was somewhere between several hundred and maybe several thousand people that were affected by this. But apparently, it’s been going on at least since 2001, so there’s probably quite a few people out there that have been surveilled, and have no knowledge about it, and again, without any court order. AMY GOODMAN: Now, has this never happened before? JAMES BAMFORD: No. It’s happened quite a bit before. Throughout the 1960s — actually, since the end of World War II, the NSA was doing illegal spying. One project was known as Project Shamrock, where they were getting illegal access to all the telegrams that came into the United States, went through the United States, or went out of the United States, every single day. They would go to New York, and Western Union would turn over all the telegrams to them. And that continued right up until the 1970s. And they were also doing a lot of targeting on communications on behalf of the C.I.A. and other agencies, telephone communications and so forth, and again, without any warrants. So that was why, after these revelations became public and during the Church Committee hearings in 1975, they created the FISA Act, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and then the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to act as sort of a buffer or a firewall between the whatever president, whatever administration happens to be in power and the American public, so there will be some neutral arbiter there to take a look at the request and decide whether the government should be able to do the eavesdropping or not. AMY GOODMAN: We’re going to go to a break. We’ll be rejoined by James Bamford, investigative journalist, Martin Garbus, First Amendment attorney, and former military intelligence analyst, Christopher Pyle. AMY GOODMAN: We’re talking about the revelations of the National Security Agency spying on Americans. We’re joined by James Bamford, investigative journalist in Washington. In a moment, Christopher Pyle, former military intelligence analyst who exposed this kind of surveillance back decades ago, and in our studio in New York, Martin Garbus, who is a well known First Amendment attorney. Martin Garbus, you wrote a piece in a letter to the editor in the New York Times that appeared on Saturday that talks about, well, both the expose, but why the Times held onto it. What is the significance of this? MARTIN GARBUS: Well, I think it’s the first time in a while that the Times has done something like that, and I compared it to the Pentagon Papers case, when they went ahead and they ignored what the government said. Here the government had meetings with the New York Times. AMY GOODMAN: Stop for a moment, for kids who are listening who don’t even know what the Pentagon Papers are. MARTIN GARBUS: The Pentagon Papers were documents that ultimately Daniel Ellsberg released. They were secret documents which indicated and gave information about our involvement in Korea and North Vietnam, in both those wars. And those documents released, the government then tried to stop the publication of those papers. The New York Times and the Washington Post both went ahead and published those stories. The government, at that time, made the claim that our foreign policy would be affected, and that particular individuals or many individuals would be killed because of the release of secret information. And the Times and the Washington Post ignored that. What we’ve recently seen is both the New York Times and the Washington Post have taken a totally different tack. The Washington Post, when it wrote about the secret prisons, was asked by the government not to give the locations of those secret prisons, and the Washington Post acceded to that. The New York Times, for one — at least one year, held up the publication of this story, and had this story come out in 2002, 2003, 2004, probably the politics in the country would be very, very different. And the New York Times had meetings with the government, and according to the New York Times, they made an investigation, and they concluded what there were legal safeguards in effect that permitted the government’s policy. Now, the New York Times has a lot of very sophisticated lawyers, and those lawyers know better than that. There is a case, and I’d like to refer to something James Bamford said, with respect to how long this has gone on before. There had been a case in 1972, when Nixon tried to do the same thing. Lenny Wineglass, a very fine lawyer, argued the case in District Court. Nixon claimed that you could, for domestic surveillance, that you had a right to use executive warrants, as he claimed, the permission of the President and the Attorney General. And he said that that was sufficient. This was at a time of civil unrest, according to him, 1971, 1972. There were some bombings within the United States. And he went out, and he tried to survey, surveillance people, eavesdropping, wiretapping without judicial warrants, without probable cause. And the United States Supreme Court said no. The United States Supreme Court said you can’t do this. The United States Supreme Court said that the President does not have that kind of power within the Constitution. He has the power to protect the nation, but this goes beyond that. He can’t violate the Constitution. That’s exactly what’s happening now. And what’s going to happen is: You now have a different Supreme Court. You’re going to have Roberts, probably Alito, and my judgment is they’re going to uphold what Bush is doing, and in effect, they’re going to reverse, though not directly, the Nixon case. It’s a strategy to get past that Nixon case and to give the President the broadest powers that any President has ever had. AMY GOODMAN: Let’s go to Christopher Pyle. He is a Professor of Politics at Mount Holyoke College right now, but formerly was a military intelligence officer who exposed — blew the whistle on the Pentagon’s spying on civilians in this country. Can you go back in time, Professor Pyle, and talk about what happened, its significance, and what you ended up doing about it? CHRISTOPHER PYLE: In the 1960s, Army intelligence had 1,500 plainclothes agents watching every demonstration of 20 people or more throughout the United States. They had a giant warehouse in Baltimore, Maryland, full of information on the law-abiding activities of American citizens, protest politics, mainly. I learned about this while I was in the Army, just before I was discharged, and I wrote about it after I was discharged, and then investigated it for two congressional committees: Senator Ervin’s Committee on Constitutional Rights and Senator Church’s Select Committee on Intelligence. As a result of those investigations, the entire U.S. Army Intelligence Command was abolished and all of its files were burned. And then, after that, the Senate Intelligence Committee wrote the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which tried to stop the warrantless surveillance of electronic communications. AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about your own counterintelligence program that you set up once you left the Pentagon? CHRISTOPHER PYLE: Well, after I disclosed the Army’s surveillance, I began hearing from students I had taught at the U.S. Army Intelligence School. I was head of the legal section there, and I taught investigative legal principles. I taught them not to do what it turned out they were doing. And so I began to conduct my own investigation; later did it under the auspices of Senator Ervin’s committee, and through that investigation, recruited 125 agents to tell what they knew about the spying to members of Congress, to the courts and to the press. AMY GOODMAN: And what happened? CHRISTOPHER PYLE: The military said they didn’t do it, and beside, they stopped, and they wouldn’t do it again. We were unable to pass legislation permanently ending it, but extensive assurance was given, executive orders were issued, and the Army was supposed to be out of the domestic spying business. AMY GOODMAN: So, your response when you heard about what the National Security Agency has been authorized to do by the President? CHRISTOPHER PYLE: Not terribly surprised, but the one piece of it that amazes me is that the President admitted that he personally ordered the National Security Agency to violate a federal statute. Now, he has no Constitutional authority to do that. The Constitution says he must take care that all laws be faithfully executed, not just the ones he likes. The statute says it’s, as you said at the beginning of the program, that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the exclusive law governing these international intercepts, and he violated it anyway. And the law also says that any person who violates that law is guilty of a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. By the plain meaning of the law, the President is a criminal. AMY GOODMAN: Martin Garbus, you say this is an impeachable offense. MARTIN GARBUS: Yes, I agree that it is a crime, that it is an impeachable offense. The question is: What will happen? The mere fact that it’s impeachable doesn’t necessarily mean that the Supreme Court will find that, and it doesn’t mean that he will necessarily be impeached. He should be impeached, but he is claiming, for the first time, that he has the authority to do this, even though FISA is there, because he has relied on counsel. He has relied on John Yoo. He has relied previously on Ashcroft, and he’s now relying on Gonzales. And all of these people are telling him that it’s legal. All these people are telling him that the President’s powers can be expanded, even though FISA is there. And the President has come up with an excuse, which I don’t see how anybody can buy. In FISA, you can get a warrant in five minutes. You just go before the FISA court and you get your warrant, and that’s all there is to it. There’s no argument — AMY GOODMAN: Hasn’t the criticism been that FISA gives them too easily? MARTIN GARBUS: Surely. Your statistics were correct. Namely, that out of some 15,000 warrant applications, there were eight that were denied since 1978, so it’s basically a rubber stamp. Now, what Bush said is, 'I don't have the time,’ he says, 'to go to FISA.' Now, everybody has had the time to go to FISA. It doesn’t take any time at all. So, that the argument that he has the right to avoid FISA, I think, is a false argument. AMY GOODMAN: James Bamford, if you could explain how exactly the surveillance happens, how does it work at the NSA? What was allowed before, in terms of monitoring overseas conversations, and where are these listening devices? JAMES BAMFORD: Well, before I get into that, just one other comment on what we just have been talking about. When the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was created in 1978, one of the things that the Attorney General at the time, Griffin Bell, said — he testified before the intelligence committee, and he said that the current bill recognizes no inherent power of the President to conduct electronic surveillance. He said, 'This bill specifically states that the procedures in the bill are the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance may be conducted.' In other words, what the President is saying is that he has these inherent powers to conduct electronic surveillance, but the whole reason for creating this act, according to the Attorney General at the time, was to prevent the President from using any inherent powers and to use exclusively this act. Now, the way the NSA actually does its eavesdropping, is it — if you think about the FBI being sort of a retail eavesdropper, they will go from house to house or put a bug on a central telephone company’s office for where a person happens to have their junction box, or whatever. The NSA, on the other hand, does it wholesale, where they take entire streams of communications coming down from satellites, which can contain millions of communications, and they sort of intercept those communications with large dishes and filter the information through very quick computers that are loaded with names of people, words that they’re looking for, and at one point they — one listening post in the central part of England, for example, they intercept two million pieces of communications an hour. So that’s emails, faxes, telephone calls, cellular calls and so forth. So, it’s an enormous amount of eavesdropping, and Senator Frank Church, back in the mid-70s, when he was conducting his investigation of NSA, said that if NSA’s technology were ever turned on the American public, there would be no place to hide. AMY GOODMAN: And how it actually goes down? I mean, how they record? JAMES BAMFORD: Well, they record it by picking up the signals. The signals are transmitted by — either by satellite or microwave or by undersea cable. And the NSAhas developed methods for eavesdropping on all of those techniques, either using satellites in space or ground stations or submarines that can actually tap into undersea cables. So, they have perfected the methods by which they can intercept all of the different forms of communications, even fiber optic communications, which are buried underground. And the key is that being able to sift through it all and pick out the communications that they want. But again, the NSA is supposed to be directed externally. And the problem is once a president decides to secretly turn the NSA’s big ear internally, and that’s what has been happening. AMY GOODMAN: On Saturday, I was talking to some U.N. personnel and ambassadors, ambassadors to the United Nations. Now, we know about the scandal of the Security Council members being eavesdropped on, wiretapped, when there was pressure in the lead up to the invasion. When I asked them about this, you know, they take this as standard fare at the U.N. Everyone assumes that they’re being wiretapped. JAMES BAMFORD: Well, that’s true, and there were a number of revelations that came out early on in the lead up to the war in Iraq. There was an employee of the British equivalent of NSA, called GCHQ, Government Communications Headquarters, who leaked a memorandum from the NSA which specifically said they were — they wanted extra targeting on some of the members of the Security Council, in order to try to get them to change their votes in favor of the United States. So by eavesdropping on their communications, they could find out — say, it was in Gambia or something, they want a bridge, so the United States can offer money to help them build a bridge, or whatever it is, offer some kind of a bribe in order to get their vote. So, that was why that document was leaked, and it showed very clearly that the U.S. was using the NSA to help sort of twist arms to get the votes they wanted in the United Nations. AMY GOODMAN: Professor Christopher Pyle? CHRISTOPHER PYLE: The problem here is everybody knows that international intercepts go on all the time, particularly those with political or economic advantage. The problem with the latest disclosure is it’s focused upon persons in the United States. Two months ago, two agents of the Department of Homeland Security went to visit a student at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. They were concerned because he had made an interlibrary loan request for Mao Tse-Tung’s book, the Little Red Book. Now, somehow the government was monitoring the email record that sought to get that book out of Peking, because the kid was looking for the official Peking version. Now, somebody is monitoring interlibrary loans. This would seem to occur under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. But the question is who is carrying it out? And it could very well be NSA. And this is precisely what the Church Committee, which I worked for, tried to stop, this kind of vacuum cleaner surveillance, this watch-listing of books and titles and words and names of people who are loyal Americans who are carrying out constitutionally protected activity. The agents actually said that the Little Red Bookis on a watch list, and so that’s why they had to investigate why he wanted to read the Little Red Book. AMY GOODMAN: Christopher Pyle, you were a military intelligence analyst. On this issue of people who say, you know, this is a different time after 9/11, and we — the U.S. has to do everything it can, no holds barred, to go after terrorists, when you have this vacuum cleaner approach, when you are taking in so much information, can this actually distract from — I mean, forget the moral implications, the legal implications, the constitutional implications — can it actually hurt efforts to protect national security? CHRISTOPHER PYLE: It entirely overwhelms the agents who are doing the analysis by gushing in this much information from so many agencies on so much trivia. The whole system is based upon the assumption that the way you find a needle in a haystack is to add more hay. AMY GOODMAN: Martin Garbus. MARTIN GARBUS: I think that one of the things that we should be aware of is the way the argument by the Bush administration has shifted. First, when they admitted to this wiretapping, they were saying it was wiretaps for surveillance between domestics and people overseas. Now, they’ve admitted it’s the wiretapping and investigation of people within the United States, domestic calls to domestic calls. Secondly, the way the argument has shifted: The argument originally had been that the mandate, given as a result of September 11, gave the President the power to do this, as it gave him the power to do torture, as it gave him the power to restrict detainees, as it gave him the power to stop habeas corpus. The argument has now shifted. They’re no longer claiming that it’s that particular enactment which gives him this authority. This is a straight constitutional argument, saying that under the Constitution, he has the power to protect the United States, and he can do anything under the Constitution to protect the United States, and therefore, he now has a constitutional power, not a statutory power, and that was, again, the argument in the Nixon case. AMY GOODMAN: And the issue about torture, the Levin-Graham amendment? MARTIN GARBUS: I think that —- I think it’s astonishing, first of all, that it’s the Levin amendment. And when that first passed in the Senate—- AMY GOODMAN: This is Michigan Senator Carl Levin. MARTIN GARBUS: One of the most, perhaps, liberal, one could argue, members of the Senate. Now, when that bill passed in the Senate, it was 79-16. So, I think it’s extraordinary the extent to which the Democrats have capitulated on this particular issue. I think this business about the PATRIOT Act, I think it’s just a firestorm. I think, ultimately, it’s going to be passed, and they are going to rely on the President’s authority at the end of the day. You really don’t need the PATRIOT Act if the President has all of this authority. So, they’re switching the argument. They no longer need that particular statute. This comes within the President’s Article 2, Section 2 rights under the Constitution to protect the people. They have changed the battleground to bring it close to the Nixon case, which they, with this new Supreme Court, will overrule. The Nixon case was ’72.

{"id":313,"title":" Germany 'eavesdropped' on Kerry and Clinton","class":0,"body":" Germany's foreign intelligence agency eavesdropped on calls made by US Secretary of State John Kerry and his predecessor Hillary Clinton, German magazine Der Spiegel has claimed. The respected news weekly reported that the agency, known by its German acronym BND, tapped a satellite phone conversation Kerry made in 2013 as part of its surveillance of telecommunications in the Middle East. The agency also recorded a conversation between Clinton and former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan a year earlier, Der Spiegel reported. The magazine did not give a source for its information, but said the calls were collected accidentally, that the three officials were not directly targeted, and the recordings were ordered destroyed immediately. In Clinton's case, the call reportedly took place on the same frequency as a terror suspect, according to Der Spiegel. The tapping of Clinton's call was reported on Friday by German public broadcaster ARD and Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. If true, the revelations would be embarrassing for the German government, which has spent months complaining to Washington about alleged American spy activity in Germany. Last year German media reports based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden prompted a sharp rebuke from Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was allegedly among the US intelligence agency's targets. A spokesman for the US embassy in Berlin and the State Department in Washington declined to comment on the latest reports. In its report on Saturday, Der Spiegel also cited a confidential 2009 BND document listing fellow NATO member Turkey as a target for German intelligence gathering. The Germany intelligence agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":314,"title":" ISRAEL EAVESDROPPED ON PRESIDENT CLINTON’S DIPLOMATIC PHONE CALLS","class":0,"body":" Israeli intelligence eavesdropped on phone calls between President Bill Clinton and Syria’s late strongman Hafez al-Assad during sensitive Middle East peace negotiations 15 years ago, a forthcoming book says, citing verbatim transcripts of the calls. Israeli intelligence also listened in as Syria’s foreign minister in New York called Assad in Damascus to report on his private conversations with American officials during the delicate 1999 talks, according to Ahron Bregman, author of Cursed Victory: A History of Israel and the Occupied Territories, scheduled for publication in the U.K. next week. Bregman, a British-Israeli political scientist and author of several books about the Jewish state and the Arabs, cites unnamed private sources who provided him transcripts of the telephone calls, and of confidential conversations in 1999 between Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Bregman also obtained a copy of a letter from Clinton’s Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, to Barak’s predecessor as prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, marked SECRET, promising that the U.S. would check with Israel first before offering peace proposals to the Arabs. Recognizing the desirability of avoiding putting forward proposals that Israel would consider unsatisfactory, Albright wrote Netanyahu on Nov. 24, 1998, the U.S. will conduct a thorough consultation process with Israel in advance with respect to any ideas the U.S. may wish to offer to the parties for their consideration. This would be particularly true, Albright wrote, with respect to security issues or territorial issues related to security… Albright, who was traveling in Brazil this week, declined to comment, according to an aide. Aides to former President Clinton did not respond to emails and phone calls asking for comment, nor did the Israeli embassy in Washington. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council also declined to comment. The wiretapping revelations will likely be greeted in Israel as explosive, analysts said, not for what the conversations exposed so much as the fact that they were leaked – suggesting that there is an Israeli Edward Snowden, as one put it. Ronen Bergman, senior military and intelligence affairs correspondent for Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel’s largest circulation daily, said the wiretapped conversations dovetail with what is known about the negotiations under way at the time between Israel and Syria under American mediation, but wondered about who was listening. Was it Israel that listened in to these conversations? This is a tough question to answer, he told Newsweek There's no doubt that Israel was (and still is) interested in eavesdropping on Assad or any other Syrian president, but did its surveillance include his conversations with the president of the United States? Was Ehud Barak running spies in Washington? Bergman said he doubted it, despite the transcripts Bregman obtained. According to an internal NSA document recently published by journalist Glenn Greenwald, Israel’s Unit 8200 eavesdroppers target us to learn our positions on Middle East problems. A CIA-led National Intelligence Estimate on cyberthreats in 2013 ranked Israel the third most aggressive intelligence service against the U.S., behind only China and Russia. Newsweek has reported recently on alleged Israeli espionage against the United States, despite its official pledges to stop after the 1985 arrest of its American agent, U.S. Navy intelligence analyst Jonathan Pollard. To the best of my knowledge, Bergman told Newsweek, after the Pollard affair, Israel does not spy on the United States or against American targets. On the other hand, the fact that Bregman managed to get ahold of wiretap transcripts, the holy grail of intelligence, whether they were obtained by Israel or the United States or any other intelligence power, proves that Edward Snowden is not alone. Bregman, a former artillery officer in the Israeli Defense Forces, declined to discuss his sources or what steps he took to authenticate the transcripts. I think your assumption should be that if a reputable publisher such as Penguin decides to go along with that, then they probably checked the matter with me and approved, he told Newsweek by email from London, where he settled in 1988 after refusing to serve in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza territories. Generally speaking, although Israel’s version of the NSA, Unit 8200, is tasked with electronic eavesdropping, Bregman repeatedly refers to Israeli agents as intercepting the telephone calls. I didn't know at the time – and I'm not sure now – how the listening was made, he told Newsweek. I wanted something simple and general to help the reader and make the text fluent and smooth… NSA [and] Unit 8200 is just too complicated, he said,  so I chose ‘Israeli agents.’ It's general enough, I believe, to include all the possibilities. The Israeli intercepts, which appeared to skirt Netanyahu’s recent statement that Israeli intelligence has not conducted any espionage operations in the United States, gave Jerusalem a big leg up in the peace negotiations, Bregman says. No doubt that tapping the telephones of Clinton and of the Syrians negotiating with Israelis in the U.S., as I describe, gave Israel a huge advantage, allowing them to be ahead of the game in peace negotiations and know what to expect in the actual talks and maneuver accordingly, he said. Israel is hardly alone in such diplomatic espionage. Documents obtained by Wikileaks and Snowden revealed U.S. intelligence and its closest allies have targeted members of the United Nations Security Council, among other diplomats, to gain an edge in negotiations. What the transcripts obtained by Bregman underscore is no surprise: the role played by the United States in nudging each side to the negotiating table. Here, for example, is Clinton trying to explain to Assad Israel’s problem with withdrawing to Syria’s borders with Israel before the June 4, 1967, Six-Day War. ‘Your gaps are not significant… Clinton tells Assad on Aug. 24, 1999, according to a telephone transcript obtained by Bregman. Clinton assured the Syrian strongman that Barak was aware of an earlier promise by his predecessor as prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a Jewish extremist, that Israel will withdraw fully from the Golan heights and he is not asking it back…  But Clinton’s message to Assad was that Barak could not go public with the pledge for fear of a negative reaction in Israel. Something, however, could be worked out, Clinton promised Assad. [Barak] believes you are a man of honor…I know he is not playing games …  Assad’s response is not in the transcript.  A few days later, on Sept. 2, 1999, Clinton called the Syrian president again, and again Israeli agents were listening, Bregman writes, although Assad himself cannot be heard. Mr. President, let me try and finish, Clinton said to Assad, according to Bregman’s transcript. [Barak’s] afraid that if he mentions explicitly the 4 June line, the matter will be leaked – and it would not be your fault, Mr. President, but because in Israel the nature of everything is to be leaked… He's afraid that over a period of time, the public in Israel, before its vote [in a referendum] would only hear about 4 June without understanding whether there was a [Syrian] response to [Israel’s] security interests… or to any other issue. Earlier, Israeli intelligence had also intercepted a telephone call from a Syrian diplomat, Riad Daoudi, and his boss, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara, after Daoudi met secretly with an Israeli emissary in Switzerland, according to Bregman. Sir, the situation now… is a bit tense, Daudi said after meeting with retired Israeli Gen. Uri Saguy, who, according to the transcript, confirmed Clinton’s message that Barak would not repudiate an earlier secret pledge on the border issue by his predecessor, but can’t in any way declare it publicly. Israeli intelligence later learned that the Clinton team was warming to Syria’s concerns. On Sept. 29, 1999, agents listened in as Syrian foreign minister al-Shara called Assad from New York to report on his meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She shows a lot of understanding ...  al-Shara said, according to a transcript obtained by Bregman. [The Americans] are learning … I have explained to her that this [issue of land] is very sensitive … every meter is important [for Syria]… She understood this but said that the other ones -- the Israelis-- insist. She said, `But this is what they want,’ so I told her, ‘convince them [otherwise].’ Shara also reported to Assad that he told Albright he was upset by Israel’s racist language in the talks. [The Israelis] say that they will not allow [the Syrians] to dip their toes in the water [of the Sea of Galilee]. I said that these are racist words … She showed sympathy… She said to me, `You’re right’ ... So she understands, Sir.’ In the end, a combination of al-Shara’s harsh public statements on Israel and both Syria and Jerusalem’s intransigence on the Galilee border issue proved fatal to the talks. Shara has screwed us…  Clinton told Barak on Dec. 15, 1999, according to a transcript acquired by Bregman. I think that the most important thing for you is the Sea of Galilee. If I were in your place I would be concerned that someone -- Syria -- could try to poison the water of the Sea of Galilee…. But only a few weeks later, Albright lashed out at the prime minister, blaming Israel for the deadlock in the negotiations and for playing with Clinton’s credibility. Very frankly...in all our history we haven't had so many telephone conversations, the vast majority of which were on your initiative, and in these conversations you said it was very important to advance on the Syrian track...and we took it very seriously, she told Barak,  according to a Jan. 10, 2000 transcript obtained by Bregman. But you surprised us… because you have made the decision not to progress fast… Nothing has happened from your side… You have not got a better friend than the U.S. and you have no better friend than Clinton and you have played with his credibility… They [the Syrians] have been flexible… and we are concerned. Israeli intelligence would prove its mettle again and again during the negotiations--right up until their collapse the following summer, Bregman shows. In July 2000, he writes, Israeli spies… a strong presence in Washington and, indeed, in Damascus, had found out about a secret effort by Clinton to use Saudi Prince Bandar as a back channel to Assad. According to a transcript obtained by Bregman, Barak upbraided the American president in a telephone call, in which he nearly boasted about Israel’s spying prowess. I've learned from intelligence that you intend to give Israel's needs to Syria through the Saudis… Barak is recorded saying. This is a mistake. Clinton was nonplused. Caught red-handed, Bregman writes, a taken-aback Clinton replied blustering, ‘… I gave Bandar nothing substantial… don’t give it another thought…’ The negotiations were all but scuttled by the time the parties met at Camp David on July 20. Thanks to his intelligence corps, moreover, Barak was well-armed when Clinton proposed starting from scratch, as Bregman puts it, and going back to the very basics of the disagreements between the parties, starting with Palestinian demands of a return to the borders of the West Bank and Gaza before the 1967 war. [R]eports from his spies in Washington had reached him just before he left for Camp David, Bregman writes of the Israeli prime minister, giving him enough time to make up his mind about the U.S. approach: He was not in favor.

{"id":315,"title":" G20 summit: NSA targeted Russian president Medvedev in London","class":0,"body":" American spies based in the UK intercepted the top-secret communications of the then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, during his visit to Britain for the G20 summit in London, leaked documents reveal. The details of the intercept were set out in a briefing prepared by the National Security Agency (NSA), America's biggest surveillance and eavesdropping organisation, and shared with high-ranking officials from Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The document, leaked by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and seen by the Guardian, shows the agency believed it might have discovered a change in the way Russian leadership signals have been normally transmitted.The disclosure underlines the importance of the US spy hub at RAF Menwith Hill in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, where hundreds of NSA analysts are based, working alongside liaison officers from GCHQ. The document was drafted in August 2009, four months after the visit by Medvedev, who joined other world leaders in London, including the US president, Barack Obama, for the event hosted by the British prime minister, Gordon Brown. Medvedev arrived in London on Wednesday 1 April and the NSA intercepted communications from his delegation the same day, according to the NSA paper, entitled: Russian Leadership Communications in support of President Dmitry Medvedev at the G20 summit in London – Intercept at Menwith Hill station. The document starts with two pictures of Medvedev smiling for the world's media alongside Brown and Obama in bilateral discussions before the main summit. The report says: This is an analysis of signal activity in support of President Dmitry Medvedev's visit to London. The report details a change in the way Russian leadership signals have been normally transmitted. The signal activity was found to be emanating from the Russian embassy in London and the communications are believed to be in support of the Russian president. The NSA interception of the Russian leadership at G20 came hours after Obama and Medvedev had met for the first time. Relations between the two leaders had been smoothed in the runup to the summit with a series of phone calls and letters, with both men wanting to establish a trusting relationship to discuss the ongoing banking crisis and nuclear disarmament. In the aftermath of their discussions on 1 April, the two men issued a joint communique saying they intended to move further along the path of reducing and limiting strategic offensive arms in accordance with the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.A White House official who briefed journalists described the meeting as a very successful first meeting focused on real issues. The official said it had been important for the men to be open about the issues on which they agreed and disagreed. Obama had stressed the need to be candid, the official noted. While it has been widely known the two countries spy on each other, it is rare for either to be caught in the act; the latest disclosures will also be deeply embarrassing for the White House as Obama prepares to meet Vladimir Putin, who succeeded Medvedev as president, in the margins of the G8 summit this week. The two countries have long complained about the extent of each other's espionage activities, and tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats are common. A year after Obama met Medvedev, the US claimed it had broken a highly sophisticated spy ring that carried out deep cover assignments in the US. Ten alleged Russian spies living in America were arrested. Putin was withering of the FBI-led operation: I see that your police have let themselves go and put some people in jail, but I guess that is their job. I hope the positive trend that we have seen develop in our bilateral relations recently will not be harmed by these events. Last month, the Russians arrested an American in Moscow who they alleged was a CIA agent. The new revelations underline the significance of RAF Menwith Hill and raise questions about its relationship to the British intelligence agencies, and who is responsible for overseeing it. The 560-acre site was leased to the Americans in 1954 and the NSA has had a large presence there since 1966. It has often been described as the biggest surveillance and interception facility in the world, and has 33 distinct white radomes that house satellite dishes. A US base in all but name, it has British intelligence analysts seconded to work alongside NSA colleagues, though it is unclear how the two agencies obtain and share intelligence – and under whose legal authority they are working under."}

The snooping was carried out at an Internet café that was set up by intelligence operatives for dignitaries to use without them being aware of the monitoring. The diplomats’ cell phone calls were intercepted and tracked by a team of 45 analysts. It also was reported that the United States intercepted the communications of Dmitri A.

{"id":317,"title":" How hackers eavesdropped on a US Congressman using only his phone number","class":0,"body":" A US Congressman has learned first-hand just how vulnerable cellphones are to eavesdropping and geographic tracking after hackers were able to record his calls and monitor his movements using nothing more than the public ten-digit phone number associated with the handset he used. The stalking of US Representative Ted Lieu's smartphone was carried out with his permission for a piece broadcast Sunday night by 60 Minutes. Karsten Nohl of Germany-based Security Research Labs was able to record any call made to or from the phone and to track its precise location in real-time as the California congressman traveled to various points in the southern part of the state. At one point, 60 minutes played for Lieu a crystal-clear recording Nohl made of one call that discussed data collection practices by the US National Security Agency. While SR Labs had permission to carry out the surveillance, there's nothing stopping malicious hackers from doing the same thing. The representative said he had two reactions: First it's really creepy, he said. And second it makes me angry. They could hear any call. Pretty much anyone has a cell phone. It could be stock trades you want someone to execute. It could be a call with a bank. The hack was done by accessing Signalling System No. 7, or SS7, a telephony signalling language used by more than 800 telecommunication companies around the world to allow their networks to interoperate. SS7 is the routing protocol that, for instance, allows a T-Mobile subscriber to connect to the Deutsche Telekom network while traveling in Germany. It also provides a way for someone on one continent to send text messages to a phone located on another continent. SS7 also makes individuals' subscriber data available to anyone with access to SS7. The problem with SS7 is that it's only as secure as its least secure or trust-worthy member. If any one of the 820 or so telcos that make up the network is hacked or employs a rogue administrator, a wealth of information—including voice calls, text messages, locations, and subscriber data—is open to interception. Some telcos rely on SS7 as a revenue generator by providing legitimate services. For instance, banks may ask a telco to confirm that a US resident's phone is located in Brazil or another overseas location before approving a charge that's made there. The assumption is that if the phone is located in the same place as a transaction, there's a good chance the card holder is traveling there and it's safe to approve the transaction. As long as you have SS7 access, it's extremely easy, Les Goldsmith, a researcher with Las Vegas security firm ESD, told Ars. Any one of the telcos that has a roaming agreement with the target network can access the phone. Goldsmith spoke on the topic of SS7 security at last month's RSA conference in San Francisco. Besides allowing a telco to query the location of phones on other carriers' networks, SS7 allows the telco to route calls and text messages through a proxy before sending it to its final, intended destination. The proxy can spoof its phone number to assume the identity of the person making the call or sending the message. As a result, the person on the receiving end would have no clue the communication is being intercepted or routed through a switch controlled by a third party. While many carriers say they're in the process of replacing SS7 to a more secure protocol known as Diameter, Goldsmith said it will likely remain backward-compatible with its predecessor for many years. That means the insecurities of SS7 are likely to remain a threat for the foreseeable future. ESD markets what it says is a solution to SS7 abuse. It comes in the form of a firewall that helps carriers decide which SS7 commands to honor and which ones to ignore. For instance, a query coming from a Russia-based telco seeking the location of a known official with the US Pentagon might be automatically dropped. According to 60 Minutes, the abuse of SS7 to snoop and eavesdrop on smartphone users is an open secret among the NSA and other intelligence agencies. Lieu sharply criticized any US agencies that may have turned a blind eye to such vulnerabilities. The people who knew about this flaw should be fired, he said. You cannot have 300 and some million Americans, and really the global citizenry, be at risk of having their phone conversations intercepted with a known flaw simply because some intelligence agencies might get some data. That is not acceptable."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":318,"title":" Opinion: The BND, a completely normal secret service","class":0,"body":" A world without secret services? The idea is too good to be true. Unfortunately, in view of the numerous security threats, both abstract and concrete, the idea is also naive. One of these potentially deadly threats is international terrorism, motivated by religious fundamentalism, which acquired a new dimension with the mass murder in the United States on September 11, 2001. Since then, it has not only been our worst enemies who, for various reasons, have fallen under suspicion, but also long-term partners and friends. And this has destroyed that modicum of trust that makes partnerships and friendships possible. Of course, not everyone is put on the same level. Enemies are, rightly, regarded as being capable of all manner of terrible things. But partners are also mistrusted, because they might be doing too little for national and global security. American spies from the National Security Agency (NSA) eavesdrop on Islamist terrorists in order to prevent terrorist attacks. And they eavesdrop on German Chancellor Angela Merkel… well, why exactly? Is it because there are people in the White House, independently of the current US president, who are afraid that attacks along the lines of September 11 could again be planned in Germany? As irrational as these sorts of scenarios may sometimes appear, they do seem to play an influential part in the minds of leading secret service agents and politicians and in their anti-terrorism strategy. All sides have to take into account that, as a result, they may recklessly and permanently damage a relationship that for many years has been good, even friendly. This is the case with US-German relations since Edward Snowden's NSA revelations - and now also with relations between Germany and Turkey. The German government has not admitted that the BND is systematically spying on its NATO partner, a partner who is, above all, of key strategic military importance. But it hasn't denied it, either. Until proven otherwise, this kind of silence allows us to draw only one conclusion: The reports in the media about the BND's spying activities are true. That may have grave consequences for the already strained relationship between Germany and Turkey. Ankara has long accused Germany in general, and Merkel in particular, of seeking to prevent Turkey from joining the European Union at all costs. Then there's the series of racism-motivated murders by the National Socialist Underground (NSU) in Germany, the victims mostly of people of Turkish origin. These crimes have still not been properly solved, let alone atoned for. One may have little to do with the other, but between them they have considerably compromised trust, at both the political and the interpersonal level. It will take a long time to reestablish trust. And unfortunately skepticism is called for, when the intelligence services are carrying on as normal, and politicians of all stripes are essentially allowing them to do so. We see this exemplified in the German-American relationship with the 'no-spy agreement' called for by Berlin: Washington has simply rejected the idea that the two countries should agree not to spy on each other. Paradoxically, in this respect the Americans are actually being consistent. They are tacitly admitting that they want to be able to use intelligence service methods to form a picture of their partners in the future, too. However, this will not make them any friends. One thing is and remains clear: The conduct of intelligence services, regardless of which country they work for, is not of a high moral standard. However, that cannot mean that we allow those in government to evade responsibility. Their task is more urgent than ever: to explain and justify, with the greatest possible transparency, the work of their intelligence services, which they call security services. They owe this to the public, and to their various partner countries. If we carry on with business as usual the mistrust will continue to grow, both at home and abroad. Mistrust leads to estrangement. Both, in the long term, damage democracy: in Germany, in the United States, in Turkey - everywhere."}

{"id":320,"title":" NSA, UK Spied On Politicians, Intercepted Emails, Eavesdropped On Russian President's Phone Calls","class":0,"body":" The espionage scandal that keeps on giving has released its latest installment, once more courtesy of the Guardian, which on the eve of tomorrow's starting G-8 meeting reveals that foreign politicians and officials who took part in two G-20 summit meetings in London in 2009 had their computers monitored, their phone calls intercepted, and fake internet cafes were set up on the instructions of the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the sister organization to the US NSA. Naturally, it wasn't just the GCHQ - according to the Guardian, during the 2009 G-20 meeting there was an NSA attempt to eavesdrop on then-Russian leader, Dmitry Medvedev, as his phone calls passed through satellite links to Moscow. And while broad espionage allegations can be deflected by pretending by the rhetoric-endowed and teleprompter-aided that only terrorist threats were targeted, it will be very difficult to explain why the national information super spooks used every trick of the trade to spy on the so-called leaders of the developed world. The disclosure raises new questions about the boundaries of surveillance by GCHQ and its American sister organisation, the National Security Agency, whose access to phone records and internet data has been defended as necessary in the fight against terrorism and serious crime. The G20 spying appears to have been organised for the more mundane purpose of securing an advantage in meetings. Named targets include long-standing allies such as South Africa and Turkey. And like that, one more conspiracy theory is relegated to the fact bin, as those using the tin foil, crack-pot conspiracy theorists fallback, are slowly becoming the biggest laughing stock in town. So who gave the green light for this blatant spying operation, which assuredly takes place at every meeting of the world's leading political (and other) dignitaries? Why that supreme gold top-tick timer himself, Gordon Brown: There have often been rumours of this kind of espionage at international conferences, but it is highly unusual for hard evidence to confirm it and spell out the detail. The evidence is contained in documents – classified as top secret – which were uncovered by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and seen by the Guardian. They reveal that during G20 meetings in April and September 2009 GCHQ used what one document calls ground-breaking intelligence capabilities to intercept the communications of visiting delegations. The timing of today's release comes at a perfect time, just as yet another G-8 meeting is due to commence shortly in the UK: The revelation comes as Britain prepares to host another summit on Monday – for the G8 nations, all of whom attended the 2009 meetings which were the object of the systematic spying. It is likely to lead to some tension among visiting delegates who will want the prime minister to explain whether they were targets in 2009 and whether the exercise is to be repeated this week. What else did the revealed G-20 spying consist of: Setting up internet cafes where they used an email interception programme and key-logging software to spy on delegates' use of computers; Penetrating the security on delegates' BlackBerrys to monitor their email messages and phone calls; Supplying 45 analysts with a live round-the-clock summary of who was phoning who at the summit; Targeting the Turkish finance minister and possibly 15 others in his party; It just goes downhill from there: A briefing paper dated 20 January 2009 records advice given by GCHQ officials to their director, Sir Iain Lobban, who was planning to meet the then foreign secretary, David Miliband. The officials summarized Brown's aims for the meeting of G20 heads of state due to begin on 2April, which was attempting to deal with the economic aftermath of the 2008 banking crisis. The briefing paper added: The GCHQ intent is to ensure that intelligence relevant to HMG's desired outcomes for its presidency of the G20 reaches customers at the right time and in a form which allows them to make full use of it. Two documents explicitly refer to the intelligence product being passed to ministers. According to the material seen by the Guardian, GCHQ generated thisproduct by attacking both the computers and the telephones of delegates. Most importantly, the bullshit excuse that spying by the GCHQ and the NSA, was being done to safeguard the safety and security of the people will no longer fly. And if anything, the latest set of disclosures should generate a diplomatic scandal of unprecedented proportions. Alas, in a world in which everyone is broke and reliant on the goodwill of the Fed, and by implication, the Fed's code breakers, the NSA, we wouldn't be surprised if nothing happens. Other documents record apparently successful efforts to penetrate the security of BlackBerry smartphones: New converged events capabilities against BlackBerry provided advance copies of G20 briefings to ministers … Diplomatic targets from all nations have an MO of using smartphones. Exploited this use at the G20 meetings last year. The operation appears to have run for at least six months. One document records that in March 2009 – the month before the heads of state meeting – GCHQ was working on an official requirement to deliver a live dynamically updating graph of telephony call records for target G20 delegates … and continuing until G20 (2 April). Another document records that when G20 finance ministers met in London in September, GCHQ again took advantage of the occasion to spy on delegates, identifying the Turkish finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, as a target and listing 15 other junior ministers and officials in his delegation as possible targets. As with the other G20 spying, there is no suggestion that Simsek and his party were involved in any kind of criminal offence. The document explicitly records a political objective – to establish Turkey's position on agreements from the April London summit and their willingness (or not) to co-operate with the rest of the G20 nations. The September meeting of finance ministers was also the subject of a new technique to provide a live report on any telephone call made by delegates and to display all of the activity on a graphic which was projected on to the 15-sq-metre video wall of GCHQ's operations centre as well as on to the screens of 45 specialist analysts who were monitoring the delegates. For the first time, analysts had a live picture of who was talking to who that updated constantly and automatically, according to an internal review. A second review implies that the analysts' findings were being relayed rapidly to British representatives in the G20 meetings, a negotiating advantage of which their allies and opposite numbers may not have been aware: In a live situation such as this, intelligence received may be used to influence events on the ground taking place just minutes or hours later. This means that it is not sufficient to mine call records afterwards – real-time tip-off is essential. The surveillance got so far as reading people's emails at the same time as they typed! One document refers to a tactic which was used a lot in recent UK conference, eg G20. The tactic, which is identified by an internal codeword which the Guardian is not revealing, is defined in an internal glossary as active collection against an email account that acquires mail messages without removing them from the remote server. A PowerPoint slide explains that this means reading people's email before/as they do.End result: a very grateful GCHQ: In the week after the September meeting, a group of analysts sent an internal message to the GCHQ section which had organised this live monitoring: Thank you very much for getting the application ready for the G20 finance meeting last weekend … The call records activity pilot was very successful and was well received as a current indicator of delegate activity … It proved useful to note which nation delegation was active during the moments before, during and after the summit. All in all, a very successful weekend with the delegation telephony plot. And now we go back to your regularly scheduled prime-time soap opera tragicomedy for idiots, in which the protagonists read from teleprompters advising the same idiots, that only terrorist suspects are targeted by the totalitarian superstate, and that no matter what, one should trust the government - after all they are only here to help you."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":321,"title":" Press apathy over Macedonia wiretaps is symptom of failing democracy","class":0,"body":" Journalists and professional press organizations were given just one day's warning on February 25 that Zoran Zaev, leader of Macedonia's opposition party the Social Democrats, would be revealing what he described as a bomb--conversations of journalists allegedly wiretapped by the government--at his weekly press conference. Claims by the Social Democrats (SDSM) that 100 journalists had been under government surveillance appeared to confirm long-held suspicions of many of the country's independent media. Since Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski came to power in 2006 conditions for the press have deteriorated, with a large TV station being forced off air, the arrest of an investigative reporter, and independent publications coming under financial pressure through allocation of state advertising. So far, only recordings allegedly of ministers and prominent supporters of Gruevski have been made public. But Zaev claimed that critical journalists and their counterparts in the pro-government media were eavesdropped on and that conversations of more than 100 journalists can be heard on tape. During the press conference, the opposition leader invited each of the affected journalists to come to party headquarters and pick up the transcripts. Colleagues told me they felt violated and disgusted having to read transcripts of calls, some of which dated back to 2011, but none of them seemed surprised. For years they have been warning each other about how unsafe talking over the phone in Macedonia is, and some would jokingly greet the intelligence chief at the end of their calls, they said. The SDSM claimed in press conferences that the wiretapping was ordered by Gruevski and his cousin, Chief of Intelligence Services Sašo Mijalkov. Gruevski has denied any involvement in the bugging and claimed the SDSM got hold of the tapes via foreign intelligence services, according to news reports. He also accused the opposition leader of trying to organize a coup. Zaev's passport has been confiscated and he was charged for espionage, reports said. The opposition leader rejected those allegations in a press conference, and said the material came from whistleblowers inside the secret services. Since details of the wiretapping were made public there have been two reactions in the press. Pro-government journalists accused the opposition chief of working for foreign services and trying to overthrow the government. And critical journalists said they had received confirmation of long-held suspicions. As Tamara Chausidis, president of the Trade Union of Macedonian Journalists, put it: The level of arrogance of the government on one side, and the apathy and passivity of the public and the journalistic community on the other are such that the consequences of the wiretappings do not produce [...] a new quality that would change things. She told me: Of course, articles were written, the professional association held a press conference demanding resignations, but all of them, the authors of those texts, the speakers at the press conference, the bugged journalists and the public as a whole, did that as some kind of strange ritual in whose effectiveness they don't actually believe. The Association of Journalists of Macedonia held a press conference to call for the resignation of the prime minister and the government over the wiretappings, but little publicity was given to its statement. Such is the state of affairs in Macedonian journalism. Chausidis is right, the apathy has taken such a strong hold on the profession that it was an illusion to think that these revelations would turn it upside down. Since Gruevski took the reins of the Macedonian government conditions for the press have worsened. In 2013, I wrote a blog about the declining state of the Macedonian media. In 2011 the largest privately owned station A1 TV was ordered to shut down. In 2013 investigative journalist Tomislav Kezarovski was arrested for allegedly revealing the identity of a protected witness who, it turned out later, was not under protection. He was sentenced to four and half years in prison, but was released in January according to CPJ research. Also in 2013, Nikola Mladenov, owner of the newspaper Fokus died in a car accident in circumstances journalists at the time said had not been investigated properly. His paper closed down after his death. Since 2006 journalists have been living in parallel worlds: the pro-governmental one and the critical one. But while the former have access to traditional print and broadcast media, the only outlet for the latter is a multitude of often poorly designed and poorly managed websites. Most rely heavily on foreign grants while the government funds its favorites through state-financed advertising, journalists I spoke to, who asked to remain anonymous, told me. Owners of independent media told me that it is practically impossible to get private advertisement, since it might put those companies at odds with the government. It is no wonder that journalists in Macedonia are apathetic and discouraged. A journalist's work makes no sense if it cannot reach a diverse audience, trigger public debate, create informed citizens, or educate the wider public. Those are some of the fundamentals of our work and in Macedonia they no longer exist. Many of my colleagues in Macedonia are investigative journalists who, with scarce resources, have managed to report on potential corruption such as Mijalkov's alleged failure to declare business dealings in the Czech Republic. The story appeared on the non-profit Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project website and NovaTV, an independent website that publishes work from journalists who used to work for A1 TV before it was closed down. In a functioning democracy a story like the wiretapping revelations would have made headlines and would have been at least considered by the public prosecution. In Macedonia it went unnoticed, except for a few thousand of us who follow the independent news websites. Since 2006, journalism has been deteriorating. Critical reporters, including myself and many of my colleagues, were constantly labeled by the prime minister and pro-government news outlets as traitors of the nation. The profession has not been the same since the closure of A1 TV and the marginalization of independent journalists. As much as the opposition's bombs are welcome because they shed a much-needed light on the Macedonian government, they are not nearly enough to bring back professional standards and ethics. The state of Macedonian journalism is nothing but a reflection of the deteriorating state of democracy in this tiny Balkan republic. Under the kitsch and faux baroque of the government's Skopje 2014 project (the name given to a criticized makeover of the capital), is a frightened and increasingly uninformed people. It is far from certain that the opposition's bombs will have a positive outcome. In other countries, such as Colombia where the wide-scale surveillance of journalists was revealed in 2009, the intelligence service was disbanded after public outcry. The apathy over revelations of surveillance in Macedonia suggests its journalism and democracy are inexorably sinking and will be saved only if the outside world starts paying attention."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":322,"title":" NSA eavesdropped on 35 world leaders","class":0,"body":" US spies eavesdropped on the phone conversations of 35 world leaders after White House, Pentagon and State Department officials gave them the numbers, The Guardian reported Thursday. A classified document provided by fugitive intelligence leaker Edward Snowden said the National Security Agency worked closely with the customer departments of the US government to secure the phone numbers of leading foreign politicians. One unnamed US official handed over 200 numbers, including those of the world leaders who were immediately tasked for surveillance by the NSA, according to the document. The latest revelations come amid a furore over allegations that the United States had tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and after revelations the NSA had monitored the Brazilian and Mexican leaders' communications. The White House has refused to say whether it had eavesdropped on Merkel in the past following an outcry in Germany. The NSA memo cited by The Guardian indicated that surveillance was not isolated and the agency routinely tracked the phone numbers of world leaders. The 2006 memo was circulated among staff in the agency's Signals Intelligence Directorate under the heading Customers Can Help SID Obtain Targetable Phone Numbers, outlining how agents could mine contact information gathered by officials in other branches of government. In one recent case, the memo noted, a US official provided NSA with 200 phone numbers to 35 world leaders. Despite the fact that the majority is probably available via open source, the PCs (intelligence production centers) have noted 43 previously unknown phone numbers. These numbers plus several others have been tasked. The memo acknowledged, however, that the eavesdropping had gleaned little reportable intelligence."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":323,"title":" Exclusive: Inside Account of U.S. Eavesdropping on Americans","class":0,"body":" Despite pledges by President George W. Bush and American intelligence officials to the contrary, hundreds of US citizens overseas have been eavesdropped on as they called friends and family back home, according to two former military intercept operators who worked at the giant National Security Agency (NSA) center in Fort Gordon, Georgia. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), called the allegations extremely disturbing and said the committee has begun its own examination. We have requested all relevant information from the Bush Administration, Rockefeller said Thursday. The Committee will take whatever action is necessary. These were just really everyday, average, ordinary Americans who happened to be in the Middle East, in our area of intercept and happened to be making these phone calls on satellite phones, said Adrienne Kinne, a 31-year old US Army Reserves Arab linguist assigned to a special military program at the NSA's Back Hall at Fort Gordon from November 2001 to 2003. Kinne described the contents of the calls as personal, private things with Americans who are not in any way, shape or form associated with anything to do with terrorism. WATCH Kinne discuss why it was 'awkward' listening to her fellow Americans. She said US military officers, American journalists and American aid workers were routinely intercepted and collected on as they called their offices or homes in the United States. Watch World News Tonight with Charles Gibson and Nightline for more of Brian Ross' exclusive report. Another intercept operator, former Navy Arab linguist, David Murfee Faulk, 39, said he and his fellow intercept operators listened into hundreds of Americans picked up using phones in Baghdad's Green Zone from late 2003 to November 2007. Calling home to the United States, talking to their spouses, sometimes their girlfriends, sometimes one phone call following another, said Faulk. WATCH Faulk discuss what a day on the job was like listening to Americans. The accounts of the two former intercept operators, who have never met and did not know of the other's allegations, provide the first inside look at the day to day operations of the huge and controversial US terrorist surveillance program. There is a constant check to make sure that our civil liberties of our citizens are treated with respect, said President Bush at a news conference this past February. But the accounts of the two whistleblowers, which could not be independently corroborated, raise serious questions about how much respect is accorded those Americans whose conversations are intercepted in the name of fighting terrorism. Faulk says he and others in his section of the NSA facility at Fort Gordon routinely shared salacious or tantalizing phone calls that had been intercepted, alerting office mates to certain time codes of cuts that were available on each operator's computer. Hey, check this out, Faulk says he would be told, there's good phone sex or there's some pillow talk, pull up this call, it's really funny, go check it out. It would be some colonel making pillow talk and we would say, 'Wow, this was crazy', Faulk told ABC News. Faulk said he joined in to listen, and talk about it during breaks in Back Hall's smoke pit, but ended up feeling badly about his actions. I feel that it was something that the people should not have done. Including me, he said. WATCH Faulke describe how U.S. officers' calls, including 'phone sex,' were intercepted, recorded & shared at NSA listening post. In testimony before Congress, then-NSA director Gen. Michael Hayden, now director of the CIA, said private conversations of Americans are not intercepted. It's not for the heck of it. We are narrowly focused and drilled on protecting the nation against al Qaeda and those organizations who are affiliated with it, Gen. Hayden testified. He was asked by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Are you just doing this because you just want to pry into people's lives? No, sir, General Hayden replied. Asked for comment about the ABC News report and accounts of intimate and private phone calls of military officers being passed around, a US intelligence official said all employees of the US government should expect that their telephone conversations could be monitored as part of an effort to safeguard security and information assurance. They certainly didn't consent to having interceptions of their telephone sex conversations being passed around like some type of fraternity game, said Jonathon Turley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University who has testified before Congress on the country's warrantless surveillance program. This story is to surveillance law what Abu Ghraib was to prison law, Turley said. NSA awarded Adrienne Kinne a NSA Joint Service Achievement Medal in 2003 at the same time she says she was listening to hundreds of private conversations between Americans, including many from the International Red Cross and Doctors without Borders. We knew they were working for these aid organizations, Kinne told ABC News. They were identified in our systems as 'belongs to the International Red Cross' and all these other organizations. And yet, instead of blocking these phone numbers we continued to collect on them, she told ABC News. WATCH Kinne describe how listening to aid workers was part of the job. A spokesman for Doctors Without Borders, Michael Goldfarb, said: The abuse of humanitarian action through intelligence gathering for military or political objectives, threatens the ability to assist populations and undermines the safety of humanitarian aid workers. Both Kinne and Faulk said their military commanders rebuffed questions about listening in to the private conversations of Americans talking to Americans. It was just always, that , you know, your job is not to question. Your job is to collect and pass on the information, Kinne said. Some times, Kinne and Faulk said, the intercepts helped identify possible terror planning in Iraq and saved American lives. IED's were disarmed before they exploded, that people who were intending to harm US forces were captured ahead of time, Faulk said. NSA job evaluation forms show he regularly received high marks for job performance. Faulk left his job as a newspaper reporter in Pittsburgh to join the Navy after 9/11. Kinne says the success stories underscored for her the waste of time spent listening to innocent Americans, instead of looking for the terrorist needle in the haystack. By casting the net so wide and continuing to collect on Americans and aid organizations, it's almost like they're making the haystack bigger and it's harder to find that piece of information that might actually be useful to somebody, she said. You're actually hurting our ability to effectively protect our national security. Both former intercept operators came forward at first to speak with investigative journalist Jim Bamford for a book on the NSA, The Shadow Factory, to be published next week. It's extremely rare, said Bamford, who has written two previous books on the NSA, including the landmark Puzzle Palace which first revealed the existence of the super secret spy agency. Both of them felt that what they were doing was illegal and improper, and immoral, and it shouldn't be done, and that's what forces whistleblowers. WATCH Bamford describe how the NSA missed signals leading up to 9/11. A spokesman for General Hayden, Mark Mansfield, said: At NSA, the law was followed assiduously. The notion that General Hayden sanctioned or tolerated illegalities of any sort is ridiculous on its face. The director of the NSA, Lt. General Keith B. Alexander, declined to directly answer any of the allegations made by the whistleblowers. In a written statement, Gen. Alexander said: We have been entrusted to protect and defend the nation with integrity, accountability, and respect for the law. As Americans, we take this obligation seriously. Our employees work tirelessly for the good of the nation, and serve this country proudly."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":324,"title":" German secret agents 'eavesdropped on phone calls' by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry","class":0,"body":" German secret agents intercepted one of Hillary Clinton's phone calls while she was US secretary of state and also listened in to a call by John Kerry, her successor, it emerged this weekend, in an embarrassing reversal of the spying scandal that blew up when it was revealed last year that America bugged Angela Merkel's mobile phone. Mrs Clinton was on a US government plane when German intelligence services overheard her call and, against their own internal protocol, stored it, intelligence sources told German media. The intercepted phone call took place in 2012 between Mrs Clinton and Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, who had just returned from negotiations in Syria and wanted to brief her, the German weekly Der Spiegel reported on Saturday. Der Spiegel also claimed that agents from the state intelligence services listened in on a phone call by John Kerry, the current US secretary of state - and that Germany has been spying on its NATO ally Turkey since 2009. Mr Kerry was apparently using a satellite link to make a telephone call last year, discussing growing tensions in the Middle East with an unknown figure, when his conversation was intercepted, the weekly reported. German intelligence sources have tried to minimise the impact of the revelations by explaining that the interception of the phone calls of both secretaries of state was only done by accident.The secret agents had not meant to hear Mrs Clinton's call or to keep the recording of it, according to a joint media investigation published on Friday by Sudddeutsche Zeitung, a German broadsheet newspaper and NDR and WDR, two German regional public broadcasting outlets. A source told the outlets that the fact that the recording of the phone call had not been immediately destroyed, as is apparently routinely done if allies' phone calls are picked up by accident, was idiocy.The news is an embarrassment to Berlin and, although the White House has so far declined to comment, the controversy over Mrs Clinton's call was reportedly brought up in recent discussions between Mr Kerry and Frank Walter-Steinmeier, the foreign minister of Germany. It is not known if Mr Kerry knew at that time or discussed the allegation that one of his own phone calls had also been intercepted. In an awkward twist for the United States, however, it appears that the White House became aware of the interception of Mrs Clinton's phone call from documents handed over by double agent Markus R, a German secret agent who was arrested by the German authorities in July, accused of spying on his own country for the US in return for payments from the CIA. It was revealed last autumn in documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former US security contractor, that America had routinely spied on ordinary German citizens and had tapped the mobile phone of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, along with 35 other heads of state in countries regarded as friends or partners of the US. US-German relations plummeted and, although less inflamed now, have not fully recovered and remain tense. Mrs Merkel at the time phoned President Barack Obama and told him that was completely unacceptable and a grave breach of trust.Ironically, while on her book tour in Germany last month, Mrs Clinton said that the US spying on Mrs Merkel was absolutely wrong and she also called the German chancellor Europe's greatest leader. The source who revealed to the German media on Friday that Mrs Clinton had been eavesdropped upon also said that another the intelligence services were conducting surveillance on another, unnamed European NATO ally. The orders apparently came directly from the German central government to the Bundesnachrichtendienst, or BND, the state intelligence arm. But it is not known if Mrs Merkel was personally involved or had any knowledge that Mrs Clinton's phone call had been intercepted, accidentally or otherwise. Mr Obama is on holiday with his family on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and the White House's National Security Council has so far declined to comment on the German revelations."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":325,"title":" Leaked Edward Snowden documents reveal eavesdropping by British intelligence agency GCHQ","class":0,"body":" Newly released NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden have showed that Britain-based GCHQ was eavesdropping on the internal communications of some of the most prestigious media houses of the world including, BBC, Reuters, The Guardian, The New York Times, Le Monde, The Sun, NBC, and The Washington Post. A report in The Guardian described a 'test exercise' that resulted in emails from these journalistic institutions to be deposited into GCHQ's internal intranet, which was available to anyone who logged into the system, reported The Verge. Although the exercise did not appear to be aimed at intelligence gathering and the resulting emails did not target any sensitive stories, but it could still represent a major violation of privacy and a reminder of how easily bulk collection systems can be abused. The test was meant to demonstrate a new filtering tool that would remove all irrelevant data from final results. Researchers pulled 70,000 emails directly from GCHQ's cable-tapping sites in 10 minutes. Then, they ran the filter to see which messages would be generated as potentially valuable intelligence and journalistic communications topped the list. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the journalists were intentionally targeted. The news comes at a time when Prime Minister David Cameron is pushing for new internet surveillance laws that could ban encrypted chat or email clients in the UK."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":326,"title":" Turkey demands 'satisfying' explanation from UK on claims of eavesdropping","class":0,"body":" Turkey has asked for a satisfying explanation from Britain on claims that the U.K. eavesdropped on Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek, amid growing pressure on U.S. and U.K. governments over leaked documents. If a news report claiming that the British government eavesdropped on Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek and his delegation during the G-20 finance ministers’ meeting in London in 2009 proves to be true, this would be a scandal that would be obviously unacceptable, for Turkey, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said yesterday in a written statement. The claims reported by British daily The Guardian are worrying, it said, underlining that the British officials are expected to present an official and satisfying statement on the issue. As a matter of fact, required diplomatic initiatives have been taken, the statement concluded, without elaborating on those initiatives. The British government eavesdropped on Şimşek and his delegation during the G-20 finance ministers’ meeting, according to the daily. The aim of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British spy agency responsible for providing signals intelligence and information assurance to the British government and armed forces, was to find out Ankara’s attitudes to financial regulation and reform, as well as Turkish willingness [or not] to co-operate with the rest of the G-20 nations, the report said. It also said the eavesdropping was done to give British officials the slight negotiating edge of knowing what the Turks were thinking about financial reform before they showed their hand. Turkish Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ünal Çeviköz said that British authorities were expected to make an official and satisfactory statement. Necessary initiatives have been taken in Ankara and London, Çeviköz wrote in his Twitter account. Earlier in the day, Şimşek said the Foreign Ministry was looking into the issue. Ministry of Foreign Affairs is looking into the issue. We’ll issue a statement after that. If true, we strongly condemn it, Şimşek wrote in his Twitter account. British Embassy officials in Ankara told Hürriyet Daily News that none of the embassy staff were authorized to make any comment on intelligence matters. When asked whether a statement might be expected from London, the same officials said the release of such a statement was not likely since the British government’s prevalent tendency regarding intelligence matters is not to make any comments. Details of the surveillance are said to be contained in documents obtained by Edward Snowden, the former CIA whistle-blower responsible for a string of disclosures about American intelligence operations. His explosive leaks of vast surveillance programs run by the National Security Agency (NSA) that trawl through telephone and Internet records have triggered widespread consternation, gaining him admirers but also critics who denounce him as a traitor. Meanwhile, leaked documents revealed that U.S. spies had intercepted communications of the then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, during his visit to London and shared with high-ranking officials from Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The document, leaked by Snowden, was drafted in August 2009, four months after the visit by Medvedev, who joined other world leaders in London, including U.S. President Barack Obama, for the event hosted by the British prime minister, Gordon Brown. Medvedev arrived in London on April 1 and the NSA intercepted communications from his delegation the same day, according to the NSA paper, entitled, Russian Leadership Communications in support of President Dmitry Medvedev at the G-20 summit in London – Intercept at Menwith Hill station. In Beijing, China called for Washington to provide explanations for the leaks. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters yesterday that Washington needed to heed international concerns and give the global community a necessary explanation. Snowden told the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong’s main English language newspaper, last week that Americans had spied extensively on targets in China and Hong Kong. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also pressured the Obama administration and said she was surprised by revelations of mass U.S. online surveillance and that she would call for transparency on its scope in talks with Barack Obama this week."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":327,"title":" Bo Xilai eavesdropped on China president","class":0,"body":" BEIJING // A wiretapping operation set up on the orders of the former provincial Communist Party chief Bo Xilai eavesdropped on a telephone conversation involving the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, according to reports. It is the latest revelation to emerge since Mr Bo, once thought likely to enter China's inner governing circle, was stripped of his job as the Chongqing party boss and later removed from the politburo. According to the New York Times, Mr Bo and his former police chief, Wang Lijun, set up the sophisticated surveillance operation as part of their smash the black crackdown on organised crime in Chongqing municipality. Such was its reach that when the anti-corruption official Ma Wen, China's minister of supervision, telephoned Mr Hu while visiting Chongqing in August, the call was intercepted. That Mr Bo apparently eavesdropped on top officials illustrates the trust deficit between the elites in China, said Bo Zhiyue, author of China's Elite Politics. They don't have enough trust so they use these devices to hear private conversations, he said, adding that Mr Bo appeared to want to confirm officials meant what they said when they complimented him in public. Anti-bugging devices used by the central authorities reportedly detected the surveillance, which led the Communist Party disciplinary watchdog to investigate activities in Chongqing, resulting in Mr Bo's downfall. The party has publicly accused Mr Bo of serious discipline violations, while his wife, Gu Kailai, is under arrest over her alleged involvement in the death of a British businessman, Neil Heywood, whose body was found in a Chongqing hotel room in November. Analysts have typically cast Mr Bo's downfall as stemming from a power struggle between liberal party factions and hard-left elements, such as Mr Bo, that favour greater state control of the economy. The 62-year-old's brazen bid for a place on the ruling nine-strong politburo standing committee through his high-profile organised crime crackdown and Communist Party nostalgia campaign is also believed to have unnerved the central authorities. The New York Times' revelations suggest an additional, or alternative, reason China's leadership purged one of the country's most charismatic officials. The newspaper said nearly a dozen officials with close party ties confirmed the wiretapping operation existed, and one analyst claimed Mr Bo had tried to monitor conversations involving other senior officials who visited Chongqing. According to Reuters, Mr Bo claimed the call to Mr Hu was intercepted by mistake. A series of teams from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection were subsequently dispatched to Chongqing, although reports say their work was made harder because the bugging operation allowed them to be monitored too. While Mr Bo is said to have provided little support for Mr Wang when the central authorities accused the police chief of wrongdoing over the wiretapping and other issues, the two men are said to have also fallen out because Mr Wang arranged for Mr Bo and his wife to be wiretapped. Some people started to investigate Wang Lijun. [Bo Xilai] said it's your own business, I'm not in a position to protect you. Maybe that was the beginning of the [break-up] of the relationship between the two, suggested Bo Zhiyue. In February Mr Wang fled to the US consulate in Chengdu, levelling allegations against Mr Bo and his wife over the death of Mr Heywood and the investigation into the alleged killing. Mr Wang later left the consulate, turning himself in to the Beijing authorities. Mr Bo has not been seen publicly since his removal in March as Chongqing party boss, while his wife remains under arrest. Yesterday it was announced that Mr Bo's brother, Bo Xiyong, also known as Li Xueming, had resigned as a director of China Everbright International amid concern the scandal could affect the Hong Kong company."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":328,"title":" Report: US 'eavesdropped on Vatican'","class":0,"body":" US secret services allegedly eavesdropped on cardinals before the conclave in March to elect a new pope, Italian weekly magazine Panorama claimed Wednesday. The National Security Agency wiretapped the pope, the magazine said, accusing the United States of listening in to telephone calls to and from the Vatican, including the accommodation housing cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio before he was elected Pope Francis. This Monday, American sources admitted for the first time that the NSA used to tap German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone, as well as the private communications of a row of other world leaders. At the same time, it was reported that the NSA tracked more than 60 million phone calls in Spain – all of them in one month. The current allegations follow a report on surveillance website Cryptome which said the United States intercepted 46 million telephone calls in Italy in December 2012 and early January 2013. Among those, there are apparently also calls from and to the Vatican, Panorama said. It is feared that the great American ear continued to tap prelates' conversations up to the eve of the conclave, it said, adding that there were suspicions that the conversations of the future pope may have been monitored. Bergoglio had been a person of interest to the American secret services since 2005, according to Wikileaks, it said. The bugged conversations were divided into four categories: leadership intentions, threats to financial systems, foreign policy objectives and human rights, it claimed. Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said we have heard nothing of this and are not worried about it. If true, the US spying would be an embarrassing blow to an institution famous for its secrecy. The goings-on of the conclave are particularly clock-and-dagger, with a system installed in the Sistine Chapel where the cardinals meet in order to scramble any mobile phone communications and excommunication for those who spill the beans. The National Security Agency, responsible for US electronic eavesdropping, said on Wednesday that it does not target the Vatican and called an Italian media report that it had done so not true. The National Security Agency does not target the Vatican Assertions that NSA has targeted the Vetican, published in Italy's Panorama magazine, are not true, agency spokeswoman Vanee Vines said in a statement.

{"id":329,"title":" Beijing firmly rejects latest hacking accusations","class":0,"body":" China on Tuesday rejected a US computer security firm's accusation of Chinese hacking against European countries before the G20 Summit in September. According to recent media reports quoting research by computer security firm FireEye Inc, Chinese hackers infiltrated the computer networks of five European foreign ministries by sending e-mails containing tainted files to staff. US computer security firms have been keen on playing up the so-called cyber threat from China. But their so-called evidence is never solid but widely doubted by professionals, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular press conference on Tuesday. They are trying to gain attention with fake facts, which will neither be conducive to international cyber security cooperation nor the professional qualifications and reputation of the firms involved, Hong said. He reiterated that China will firmly safeguard cyber security and oppose hacking in all forms. China has formulated laws to combat such behavior and is also working with the international community on tackling cyber crimes, the spokesman added. According to research by FireEye, Chinese hackers eavesdropped on the computers of five European foreign ministries before September's G20 Summit, which was dominated by the Syrian crisis. The hackers allegedly infiltrated the ministries' computer networks by sending e-mails to staff containing tainted files with titles such as US military options in Syria, said FireEye. When recipients opened these documents, they loaded malicious code on to their personal computers. The US company declined to identify the nations whose ministries were hacked, although it said they were all members of the European Union. FireEye said it reported the attacks to the victims through the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A spokeswoman for the FBI, Jenny Shearer, declined to comment."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":330,"title":"The United States' Global Surveillance Record","class":0,"body":" Evidence provided by Snowden shows that China is one of the major targets of the United States' illegal spying operations. The United States has eavesdropped on Chinese state leaders, scientific institutes, universities and enterprises. Documents revealed by Snowden to Der Spiegel prove that the United States has conducted mass cyber-attacks on China, targeting Chinese state leaders and the giant high-tech company Huawei. Attacks were also aimed at the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Chinese banks and telecommunication companies. According to Der Spiegel, the spying operations also covered several former Chinese state leaders, and government departments and banks. Chinese government offices are a particular target of U.S. spy operations. A White House foreign policy aide revealed that the United States planted optical fiber bugs in the walls of the offices of the Chinese Embassy in Australia when it was built in 1990. The bugs were not deactivated until the story was broken by the Sydney Morning Herald. According to a report by Foreign Policy magazine, the United States has stolen a huge amount of important intelligence information from China and other countries via cyber-attacks carried out by the NSA's Office of Tailored Access Operations (TAO), which was established in 1997. A report by Der Spiegel cited a leaked map dating from 2010 that shows U.S. global spy operations have penetrated 90 countries, among which China is the chief target in East Asia. Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Hong Kong and Taipei, are on the priority target list of the NSA. The agency hacked hundreds of computers and Internet servers on the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong since 2009. Targets in Hong Kong included universities, government officials, business people and students. According to an interview with Snowden by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the NSA uses numerous methods to hack Chinese telecommunication companies in order to steal messages of their users. Snowden also told the SCMP that the NSA had hacked the servers of Tsinghua University, China's most prestigious university. At least 63 computers and servers were attacked in January, 2013. The SCMP report noted that the attack on Tsinghua University, home to one of six main network backbones -- the China Education and Research Network -- means that data from millions of Chinese citizens may have been stolen. The SCMP, quoting Snowden, made it clear that the U.S. government has been hacking extensively into China's major telecommunication companies and mobile phone operators to steal millions of private text messages. According to Reuters, the NSA reached a US$10-million deal with RSA, an encryption technology and security service provider, to insert a deliberate flaw or backdoor in its cryptography system to make it easier for the NSA to launch mass spying programs. Chinese clients of RSA include three major Chinese telecommunication operators -- China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom, as well as the Bank of China, The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, telecommunications provider Huawei, and home appliances group Haier Electronics. Based on confidential documents provided by Snowden, the Washington Post reported that, during the year before May, 2012, the NSA had collected, stored, obtained or distributed legally protected communications for 2,776 times without authorization. These illegal operations were especially frequent during the first quarter of 2012. The report suggested that this was probably because of NSA eavesdropping on Chinese citizens who visited the U.S. during Chinese Spring Festival at the beginning of the year. The United States even retrieves information from computer games. Both the Guardian and the New York Times published a file from investigative news organization Propublica that revealed how intelligence agents from Britain and the United States used games such as, World of Warcraft and Second Life to spy on the players. It is well known that the majority of players of these two online games are Chinese. The U.S. spying operations penetrate every corner of China. Snowden also revealed a series of confidential documents which show that QQ, the chat software of Internet giant Tencent, and Fetion, the instant messaging service of China Mobile, were targeted by the NSA. According to Foreign Policy magazine, when the United States was putting pressure on China over the issue of cyber-attacks, it failed to mention its own mass cyber espionage on Chinese Internet. U.S. officials had always declined to comment on the issue when questioned by journalists after China had accused America of secret snooping operations. The websites of Der Spiegel and the New York Times have also reported how the NSA has made huge efforts to spy on Huawei Technologies, the second largest telecom solutions provider in the world. It began activities against Huawei in 2009, because it is the biggest competitor to U.S. telecoms giant Cisco. A specially designated NSA team penetrated Huawei's network and copied the details of 1,400 of its customers as well as training manuals for the company's engineers. According to the report, the NSA also stole the company's email files as well as the source code of some products. The NSA penetrated into Huawei's headquarters in Shenzhen where the staff emails are handled. American spying operations have gathered a huge number of internal emails of staff members, including senior executives, since January, 2009. According to U.S. intelligence agencies, gaining an understanding of how the company operates will pay off in the future. So far, according to their narrative, cyber space has been effectively controlled by the West, but Chinese companies are challenging Western dominance. If the U.S. monopoly of technological standards is broken, China will gradually take control of information flow on the Internet. A report on the website of the New York Times on March 22 this year said that U.S. officials have always considered Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei as a security threat, and blocked business deals in the United States for fear that Huawei might create backdoors in its equipment to allow the Chinese military or Beijing-backed hackers to steal corporate and government secrets. But leaked classified documents reveal that it is the NSA that is creating its own backdoors into Huawei's networks. According to the New York Times report, the intelligence operation against China by the NSA is not limited to Huawei. Documents leaked by Snowden in April 2013 revealed that the NSA infiltrated two major Chinese mobile network companies in order to track strategically important Chinese military units."}

What Putin failed to mention is that Russian and U.S. laws governing wiretapping differ substantially. In the U.S., law enforcement or intelligence agencies must first receive a court order permitting wiretapping. They send that warrant to telephone operators and Internet providers, which are then required by law to intercept the requested information and forward it to the respective government agencies. In Russia, Federal Security Service officers are also required to obtain a court order to eavesdrop, but once they have it they are not required to present it to anybody except their superiors in the FSB. While the U.S. has checks and balances that regulate how the state eavesdrops on its citizens, Russia has none. The FSB has control centers that are connected by cables directly to operators' computer servers. To monitor particular phone conversations or Internet communications, an FSB agent only has to enter a command into the control center located in the local FSB headquarters. That practice is in place throughout the country. Every regional FSB headquarters is connected by cables to all telephone operators and Internet providers in the region. That system, known as the Law Enforcement Support System, or SORM, is actually a holdover from the country's Soviet totalitarian past and was developed by a KGB research institute in the mid-1980s. Recent technological advances have simply been used to fine-tune the system. Now, the SORM-1 system captures telephone and mobile phone communications, SORM-2 intercepts Internet traffic, and SORM-3 collects information from all forms of communication, providing long-term storage of all information and data on subscribers. But Russia's general approach to surveillance dates back to the Soviet era and has changed little since then. It has none of the checks and balances that are present in the West. FSB agents wanting to add a new phone number to monitor do not need to obtain a new court order and send it to the telephone operator or Internet provider. All they have to do is enter the required information into the control system in their office. Meanwhile, the Russian system, like its U.S. counterpart, is expanding very rapidly. According to information obtained from Russia's Supreme Court, the number of intercepted telephone conversations and e-mail messages has doubled over a period of six years, from 265,937 in 2007 to 539,864 in 2012. What's more, these statistics do not include all of the counterintelligence eavesdropping on foreigners, the main category of wiretapping activity for the NSA in the U.S. In contrast to the U.S., SORM is also used to wiretap the Kremlin's political opponents with full support from the courts, which rubber-stamp requests for warrants. This became evident on Nov. 12, when the Supreme Court upheld the right of the authorities to eavesdrop on the opposition. In that case, the court recognized the legality of an FSB operation to wiretap conversations of Yekaterinburg city lawmaker Maxim Petlin because he had participated in a protest rally at which the FSB was criticized. At the same time, however, Russia doesn't have the advanced technology to intercept global telecommunications traffic to the extent that it is done in the U.S., but that does not mean Russia is not eavesdropping on communications beyond its borders. A major advantage for the FSB is that the former branch offices of the KGB that are located in member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, employ the same surveillance practices as Russia does. When those countries update their wiretapping systems, they not only purchase Russian equipment but even copy Russian legislation, often word for word. This trend increased dramatically after the outbreak of the Arab Spring. Beginning in 2010, CIS members began modernizing their national systems for wiretapping and communications interception by modeling them after Russia's SORM. In March 2010, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko signed a decree to create a SORM-type system in that country. In late 2010, Ukraine modernized the national requirements for its own SORM. And the National Security State Committee of Kyrgyzstan posted a draft resolution for strengthening its SORM system on its website last August, and that system turned out to be practically identical to the Russian version. Within a few years, the authorities might finally create what Soviet leaders had hoped to achieve before historical events stopped them: a unified system for wiretapping telecommunications and monitoring Internet traffic spanning most of the territory of the former Soviet Union.

{"id":333,"title":" Recent NSA Surveillance Includes Israelis, Congress","class":0,"body":" WASHINGTON, D.C., United States of America — U.S. spying programs picked up communications between members of Congress and Israeli leaders, giving the White House insight into Israel’s lobbying of U.S. lawmakers against the Iran nuclear deal. In a report first published by The Wall Street Journal late Tuesday, the U.S. reportedly continued to spy on select leaders of allied nations, despite President Barack Obama’s pledge to curb such surveillance two years ago. The Obama administration decided against monitoring Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, but continued to monitor Netanyahu and Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Although President Obama had promised to curb eavesdropping on world leaders who are U.S. allies, there were a few leaders the White House wished to continue monitoring, including Netanyahu. The original reason for the stepped up surveillance of Netanyahu, according to the Wall Street Journal, was the fear that he would strike Iran without warning. It was also discovered that Netanyahu and his advisers leaked details they had learned though Israeli intelligence concerning the US-Iran negotiations, and coordinated talks with Jewish-American groups against the deal and tried to influence votes of undecided US lawmakers. As a part of the surveillance, the NSA eavesdropped on communications between Israeli and US lawmakers amid efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. Specifically, the efforts of the Netanyahu government to turn legislators against the negotiations and convince them to block the emerging agreement were revealed. Before Netanyahu came to address Congress, the NSA had intercepted Israeli messages that said Netanyahu ‘wanted the latest U.S. positions in the Iran talks.’ According to the report, Obama administration officials thought the information they uncovered could potentially counteract Netanyahu’s crusade to stop the nuclear deal. Ultimately, the administration decided to let the NSA decide what to share. We didn’t say, ‘Do it,' a senior U.S. official told the Journal. We didn’t say, ‘Don’t do it.' Netanyahu spoke out against a potentially unsatisfactory nuclear deal during a speech to a joint session of Congress in March. The U.S. and five other world powers reached a deal with Iran in July. Netanyahu has previously criticized the United States for its spying efforts, specifically those targeted toward Israelis. Officials said Obama insisted that keeping tabs on Netanyahu served a compelling national security purpose."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":334,"title":" How Britain and the US keep watch on the world","class":0,"body":" From the National Security Agency's imposing headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland, ringed by a double-chain fence topped by barbed wire with strands of electrified wire between them, America bugs the world. Nothing politically or militarily significant, whether mentioned in a telephone call, in a conversation in the office of the secretary general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, or in a company fax or e-mail, escapes its attention. Its computers - measured in acres occupied by them rather than simple figures - vacuum the entire electromagnetic spectrum, homing in on key words which may suggest something of interest to NSA customers is being conveyed. The NSA costs at least $3.5bn (£1.9bn) a year to run. It employs at least 20,000 officers (not counting the 100,000 servicemen and civilians around the world over whom it has control). Its shredders process 40 tons of paper a day. Its junior partner is Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the eavesdropping organisation for which Katharine Gun worked. Like NSA, GCHQ is a highly secret operation. Until 1983, when one of its officers, Geoffrey Prime, was charged with spying for the Russians, the Government had refused to reveal what GCHQ's real role was, no doubt because its operations in peacetime were without a legal basis. Its security is maintained by massive and deliberately intimidating security. Newspapers have been discouraged from mentioning it; a book by a former GCHQ officer, Jock Kane, was seized by Special Branch police officers and a still photograph of its headquarters was banned by the Independent Broadcasting Authority, leaving a blank screen during a World in Action programme. As with NSA, the size of GCHQ's staff at Cheltenham, about 6,500, gives no real indication of its strength. It has monitoring stations in Cyprus, West Germany, and Australia and smaller ones elsewhere. Much of its overseas work is done by service personnel. Its budget is thought to be more than £300m a year. A large part of this is funded by the United States in return for the right to run NSA listening stations in Britain - Chicksands, Bedfordshire; Edzell, Scotland; Mentworth Hill, Harrogate; Brawdy, Wales - and on British territory around the world. The collaboration between the two agencies offers many advantages to both. Not only does it make monitoring the globe easier, it solves tricky legal problems and is the basis of the Prime Minister's statement yesterday that all Britain's bugging is lawful. The two agencies simply swap each other's dirty work. GCHQ eavesdrops on calls made by American citizens and the NSA monitors calls made by British citizens, thus allowing each government plausibly to deny it has tapped its own citizens' calls, as they do. The NSA station at Menwith Hill intercepts all international telephone calls made from Britain and GCHQ has a list of American citizens whose phone conversations interest the NSA. The NSA request to GCHQ for help in bugging the diplomats from those nations who were holding out for a second Security Council resolution to authorise an attack on Iraq is unsurprising. Nor is it surprising that both organisations wanted to provide their political masters with recordings of private conversations of high-ranking international diplomats. It is not difficult. Listening bugs can be planted in phones, electrical plugs, desk lamps and book spines. Given a clear line of sight, one device enables someone to detect and and interpret sound waves vibrating against the glass window panes of an office. Bugging the world is not the problem. The problem is avoiding drowning in a sea of information. We should not be surprised that GCHQ and NSA eavesdrop on us. We pay them to do it. We should be asking: Do they earn their keep? And, unless we get a few more whistle-blowers like Ms Gun, we will not know, because both agencies surround themselves with a wall of secrecy. WHO DO WE BUG? Although under domestic law GCHQ needs a warrant from the Home Secretary to tap telephones in Britain, it can do so abroad without such authorisation. But the United Nations headquarters in New York is considered sovereign territory, and placing a bug there would be illegal under international law. Intelligence services spy on hostile and friendly countries, the latter mainly for commercial reasons, but also to gain an edge in diplomatic negotiations. Nato allies are not always immune from intelligence operations by Britain. Staff working for the UN inspection teams in Iraq were convinced they were under surveillance. France, Germany and Russia complained of a rise in espionage against them. There was intense activity directed at Jordan and Syria, as well as Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Egypt. Officials say the only shock about Katharine Gun's discovery of an e-mail from the National Security Agency is that she was surprised by it."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":335,"title":" New Snowden leak: NSA, Britain's GCHQ, eavesdropped on foreign leaders","class":0,"body":" esident Obama and the other leaders of the Group of Eight nations gather in Northern Ireland on Monday for a two-day summit. And thanks to the latest revelations from U.S. National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, the already delicate conversations between those leaders will probably be more awkward than usual. Among other things, this leak suggests that, as in sporting events, there's a home-field advantage when it comes to hosting international summits. On Sunday, Britain's The Guardian said that at a 2009 G20 summit of world leaders in London, Britain's counterpart to the NSA, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), electronically monitored foreign delegations. The reports are based on documents from Snowden, and include some pretty interesting details, including that GCHQ and MI6 set up and lured foreign delegates into internet cafes specially rigged to record keystrokes and intercept emails, and that the Brits managed to crack into some delegates' BlackBerrys. In this case, the point of the eavesdropping wasn't anything you'd find in a John le Carré novel. No, says The Guardian, it appears to have been set up for the more mundane purpose of securing an advantage in meetings, which were geared toward global economics. That is, diplomatically speaking, an unfair advantage, and lots of countries will be annoyed by the report. But the only named targets the newspapers identifies are long-standing allies such as South Africa and Turkey. The Guardian also highlighted one document detailing efforts by an NSA team in North Yorkshire, England, to target and decode encrypted phone calls from London to Moscow which were made by the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, and other Russian delegates. Medvedev is no longer president, but Obama will meet with Russia's Vladimir Putin this week, with whom Medvedev was likely communicating in 2009. Matthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian in Washington, isn't that impressed with the newest leak. Snowden's earlier revelations confirmed longstanding suspicions that NSA's surveillance in this country is far more intrusive than we knew, Aid tells The New York Times. But while the new information will remind G8 delegates to be wary, possibly thwarting new GCHQ plans, it won't surprise anybody at the conference. This is just what intelligence agencies do — spy on friends and enemies alike, Aid says. The document on NSA attempts to snoop on Medvedev fall into the same boat: Russia has apparent confirmation of one NSA tactic, but won't be surprised. Still, says Caroline Bankoff at New York, while the United States spying on Russia (and vice versa) is certainly nothing new, this particular instance is kind of funny because Obama 'stressed the need to be candid' at the meeting in 2009. And this late-breaking report in The Guardian will likely have no effect on everyone's plans to spy on each other on Monday, she says, but it might give protesters some new ideas for things to put on their signs. How did an NSA contractor get hold of top secret British documents? The ones posted by The Guardian appear to be mainly PowerPoint presentations touting the GCHQ's success — are all government secrets now on PowerPoint? — and one of the slides has the logos of the NSA and Canadian intelligence, as well as GCHQ's. That suggests Snowden had access to them under the auspices of a joint program, GCHQ historian Richard J. Aldrich tells the Times. If nothing else, these new Snowden documents offer a rare window onto the everyday electronic spying that the agency does in close cooperation with Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, says the Times. But Snowden's leaks will have real consequences for Obama, and Europe, says Scott Wilson in The Washington Post. Obama's buoyant popularity among Europeans has already waned since his first year, and the NSA leaks have angered many European politicians, particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he will see on both stops of his three-day visit. Germany and France are also frustrated that Obama didn't agree to arm Syria's struggling rebels earlier, Wilson says, but the NSA's internet data-collection details will likely have a concrete effect on talks over a new U.S.-European Union trade pact: Already concerned about how and where data is stored and protected, European leaders have bristled over the NSA program, raising the prospect of restrictions on the flow of information, data-storage rules and new protections for intellectual property as part of any new trade agreement. The NSA data harvest also feeds Europeans' disappointment that Obama may not have turned out to be a political redeemer after George W. Bush, Jan Techau at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace tells The Washington Post. Those expectations, of course, were greatly exaggerated. Soon it became clear, as it is now, that he is simply an American president with all of the ugly power politics that the position involves. Snowden says he went rogue to warn Americans that their privacy rights are in danger by NSA overreach. As the scope of his leaks widen to U.S. — and now British — spying abroad, it seems he has a larger plan, or no plan at all."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":336,"title":" NEW ZEALAND PLOTTED HACK ON CHINA WITH NSA","class":0,"body":" New Zealand spies teamed with National Security Agency hackers to break into a data link in the country’s largest city, Auckland, as part of a secret plan to eavesdrop on Chinese diplomats, documents reveal. The covert operation, reported Saturday by New Zealand’s Herald on Sunday in collaboration with The Intercept, highlights the contrast between New Zealand’s public and secret approaches to its relationship with China, its largest and most important trading partner. The hacking project suggests that New Zealand’s electronic surveillance agency, Government Communications Security Bureau, or GCSB, may have violated international treaties that prohibit the interception of diplomatic communications. New Zealand has signed both the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, international treaties that protect the inviolability of diplomatic correspondance. The country’s prime minister, John Key, said in a recent speech on security that New Zealand had an obligation to support the rule of law internationally, and was known for its integrity, reliability and independence. Last year, Key said that New Zealand’s relationship with China, worth an estimated $15 billion in annual two-way trade, had never been stronger. The relationship was not just about purely trading, he said. It is so much broader and much deeper than that. In 2013, Key described a meeting with top Chinese officials in Beijing as extremely warm and told of how he was viewed as a real friend by the country’s premier, Li Keqiang. At the same time, as minister in charge of the GCSB, Key was overseeing spying against China — which included the top-secret planned operation in Auckland, aimed at the Chinese consulate. The hacking project is outlined in documents obtained by The Intercept from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. A secret report called NSA activities in progress 2013, includes an item titled New Zealand: Joint effort to exploit Chinese MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] link. The operation, according to another NSA document, had identified an MFA data link between the Chinese consulate and Chinese Visa Office in Auckland, two buildings about a five-minute walk apart on the city’s busy Great South Road. The document added that the New Zealand agency was providing additional technical data on the data link to the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations, a powerful unit that hacks into computer systems and networks to intercept communications. The agencies had verbally agreed to move forward with a cooperative passive and active effort against this link, it said. Passive surveillance refers to a method of eavesdropping on communications that intercepts them as they are flowing over Internet cables, between satellites, or across phone networks. Active surveillance is a more aggressive tactic that involves hacking into computers; in the case of the Auckland operation, active surveillance could have involved planting spyware in the Chinese government computers or routers connected via the consulate data link. The documents do not reveal whether the operation was successfully completed, due to the timeframe that the records cover. In May 2013, Snowden left his Hawaii-based intelligence job and flew to Hong Kong carrying the cache of secret files. In April 2013, shortly before Snowden’s departure, formal coordination on the hacking plan had begun between the NSA and its New Zealand counterpart, according to the documents. More New Zealand operations targeting China appear to have been ongoing at that time. In another April 2013 NSA document describing the agency’s relationship with New Zealand spies, under the heading What partner provides to NSA, the first item on the list is collection on China. New Zealand’s GCSB surveillance agency continues to be especially helpful in its ability to provide NSA ready access to areas and countries that are difficult for the United States to access, the report said. China intelligence is handled inside the New Zealand agency by a special section that focuses on economic analysis. According to sources with knowledge of the agency’s operations, its economic section, known as the IBE, specialized in Japanese diplomatic communications from 1981 until the late 2000s. In recent years its focus has shifted to intercepted Chinese communications, the sources say. In response to the revelations, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand told the Herald on Sunday that the country was concerned about the spying. We attach great importance to the cyber security issue, the spokesperson said, adding that China proposes to settle disputes through dialogue and formulate codes to regulate cyber space behaviors that are acceptable to all sides. China itself is known to be a major perpetrator of espionage on the global stage, and it has been repeatedly accused by the U.S. government of hacking into American computer networks. Last year, China was linked to an apparent intelligence-gathering hack on a powerful New Zealand supercomputer used to conduct weather and climate research. But the Snowden documents have shown that countries in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance — which includes New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia — are also heavily involved in conducting aggressive spying and hacking operations across the world. Previous revelations have detailed how agencies in the alliance have hacked law–abiding companies, foreign government computers, and designed technology to attack and destroy infrastructure using cyberwar techniques. Last year, The Intercept revealed how the NSA had developed the capability to deploy millions of malware implants to infect computers and steal data on a large scale. The NSA, the GCSB and the New Zealand prime minister’s office each declined to answer questions about this story. GCSB’s acting director, Una Jagose, said in an emailed statement that the agency exists to protect New Zealand and New Zealanders. She added: We have a foreign intelligence mandate. We don’t comment on speculation about matters that may or may not be operational. Everything we do is explicitly authorised and subject to independent oversight."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":337,"title":" How NZ and US agents plotted to spy on China","class":0,"body":" On Auckland's busy Great South Rd in the suburb of Greenlane, the Chinese consulate, a white modern building, is tucked behind a row of bushes and small trees. A five-minute walk down the road, opposite a cafe, is a smaller, grey building that houses the Chinese Visa Office. Between the two is a data link used to transmit diplomatic communications. In 2013, New Zealand's spies hatched a top-secret plan to hack into it. The operation, a joint project with the US National Security Agency (NSA), is revealed in classified documents seen by the Herald on Sunday. The files show how, under the John Key National Government, spying has been prioritised against China, New Zealand's largest and most important trading partner. A 2013 NSA document placed collection on China first on a list of targets monitored by the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) on behalf of the NSA. The GCSB continues to be especially helpful in its ability to provide NSA ready access to areas and countries that are difficult for the United States to access, the report said. The secret documents revealing the surveillance were analysed by the Herald on Sunday in collaboration with the US news website The Intercept, which obtained them from the NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden. The documents highlight a two-faced New Zealand government policy towards China and raise questions about whether the GCSB has violated international treaties that prohibit the interception of diplomatic communications. Publicly, the government has declared a good relationship with China is crucial to New Zealand's economic future. Key has talked about expanding links to grow trade and explore other opportunities with the North Asian economic powerhouse. Since the Free Trade Agreement was signed in Beijing in 2008 - after 15 rounds of talks over three years - two-way trade is worth $20 billion a year and rising. But it is fragile. Scares such as the Fonterra botulism milk powder recall risk the relationship, and Australia has recently signed an FTA with China, prompting concern that could affect our existing deal. At a Beijing meeting with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, in March last year, Key said: This relationship has never been stronger. Xi Jinping visited New Zealand later that year, stating the China-New Zealand relationship was based on friendly co-operation and mutual respect, and set a fine example for the pursuit of successful state-to-state relations.Key replied that he looked forward to seeing how we can take our relationship to an even greater height. The relationship was not purely trading, he said. It is so much broader and much deeper than that. But, as minister in charge of the GCSB, Key was also overseeing the plot to spy on China, which included the top-secret planned operation against the Chinese consulate in Auckland. The joint GCSB-NSA operation is outlined in a document called NSA Activities in Progress 2013. One of two New Zealand items on this list is New Zealand: Joint effort to exploit Chinese MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] link.This high-stakes operation targeted communications passing between the two Chinese government buildings on Great South Rd. Another NSA document dated April 2013 said the GCSB had identified an MFA data link between the Chinese consulate and Chinese Visa Office in Auckland. The NSA and GCSB agreed to work together to eavesdrop on the Chinese communications carried on this link. Because of the time-frame they cover, the Snowden documents do not reveal whether the operation was completed. In May 2013, Snowden left his Hawaii-based intelligence job and flew to Hong Kong carrying the cache of secret files. In the weeks before his departure, the consulate project had been agreed and was actively being planned, but it was not yet fully under way. The consulate spying project appeared to be called GCSB Project Frostbite. It had a separate name inside the NSA: Project Basilhayden. The April 2013 document said that formal co-ordination on the eavesdropping plan had begun between the NSA and GCSB. The GCSB was providing additional technical data on the [Chinese Consulate] link to TAO, the NSA's powerful Tailored Access Operations division that hacks into target computer systems and networks, such as the data link, to intercept communications and data. A further NSA document, a monthly report written in March 2013 by the NSA's Special US Liaison Officer in Wellington, said the GCSB was drafting a paper on Project Frostbite that outlines the interaction with TAO for this activity.The document, to be signed by the GCSB director, would answer questions by TAO on the operation that will allow it to go forward.Matthew Aid, an American intelligence expert and author of a book on the NSA, reported in Foreign Policy magazine in 2013 that the TAO had successfully been penetrating Chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years, in what the NSA calls computer network exploitation, or CNE. The GCSB's role in hacking operations is lesser known. But the agency has a secretive hacking unit in its Operations Division, based at its Wellington headquarters, that is devoted to network analysis. It is probably these staff who studied the Chinese consulate facilities and found the data link. The April 2013 report said: NSA and GCSB have verbally agreed to move forward with a co-operative passive and active effort against this link. Passive surveillance refers to eavesdropping on communications as they are flowing over cables or between satellites. Active surveillance surveillance is a more aggressive method that involves hacking into computers or networks; it could involve planting spyware in the Auckland-based Chinese government computers or routers. It is a serious step for the Government to co-operate in spying on consular communications. New Zealand has signed the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, international treaties that protect the inviolability of consulates and their communications. Key said recently that New Zealand was known for its integrity, reliability and independence, and had an obligation to support the rule of law internationally. Government insiders say New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been worried about the GCSB's China plot becoming public since the Snowden leaks appeared in mid-2013. The sources say former diplomat and defence secretary John McKinnon was brought out of retirement and posted to Beijing as New Zealand Ambassador specifically to help manage the Chinese reaction to any revelations about New Zealand's role in the surveillance. McKinnon speaks Chinese and was seen as most able to manage relationships with the Chinese leaders. The Chinese Government reacted unhappily to an earlier Herald story that named China as one of about 20 countries targeted by the GCSB. That story contained no detail about China spying, just the word China on a list. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei still responded that China is concerned about relevant report.China is known to be a major perpetrator of espionage on the global stage, and the US Government has repeatedly accused it of hacking into American computer networks. Last year, China was linked to a hacking attack on a powerful New Zealand supercomputer operated by Niwa, used to conduct weather and climate research. But the Snowden documents have shown countries in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance - which includes New Zealand, the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia - are just as heavily involved in cyber spying and hacking. China intelligence is handled inside the GCSB by a section of the agency that focuses on economic analysis. According to GCSB staff, the economic section, known as the IBE, specialised in Japanese diplomatic communications from 1981 until the late 2000s. In recent years its focus has shifted to intercepted Chinese communications. • Nicky Hager is a New Zealand-based investigative journalist. Ryan Gallagher is a Scottish journalist who works for US news organisation The Intercept. A plot to spy on China is the most damning revelation from the Snowden documents - and Green co-leader Russel Norman says it is putting one of our biggest export markets at risk. The Chinese government would be unhappy at the GCSB's attempt to access its communications, said Norman. And for what? And because it can only have happened with the personal approval of John Key, it jeopardises the personal relationship between Key and [Chinese Premier] Xi. Labour leader Andrew Little said New Zealand appeared to be speaking of its strong relationship with China at the same time as planning intrusive surveillance. He said the approaches appeared in conflict with each other. The Snowden documents have emerged in a reporting project between the Herald on Sunday, investigative journalist Nicky Hager and the US news site, The Intercept. Thomas Beagle, Council for Civil Liberties chairman, said the leak of the documents was an important democratic step to allow a level of involvement by the people being governed. We need to know these things because we can't practice our diplomatic oversight without it. If we don't know these things are happening it's out of the realm of democracy. He said other countries used a panel of trusted citizens as the oversight mechanism for intelligence agencies. Victoria University's Dr Jim Rolfe, director of its Centre for Security Studies, said there were areas of government which were not helped by public scrutiny. He said the Snowden revelations had produced benefits in revealing over-reach in some intelligence operations, although 90 per cent of it is prurient.I suspect things have been hurt rather than helped by Snowden because it has distracted policy makers from their work."} 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":338,"title":" U.S. Enables Chinese Hacking of Google","class":0,"body":" Google made headlines when it went public with the fact that Chinese hackers had penetrated some of its services, such as Gmail, in a politically motivated attempt at intelligence gathering. The news here isn't that Chinese hackers engage in these activities or that their attempts are technically sophisticated -- we knew that already -- it's that the U.S. government inadvertently aided the hackers. In order to comply with government search warrants on user data, Google created a backdoor access system into Gmail accounts. This feature is what the Chinese hackers exploited to gain access. Google's system isn't unique. Democratic governments around the world -- in Sweden, Canada and the UK, for example -- are rushing to pass laws giving their police new powers of Internet surveillance, in many cases requiring communications system providers to redesign products and services they sell. Many are also passing data retention laws, forcing companies to retain information on their customers. In the U.S., the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act required phone companies to facilitate FBI eavesdropping, and since 2001, the National Security Agency has built substantial eavesdropping systems with the help of those phone companies. Systems like these invite misuse: criminal appropriation, government abuse and stretching by everyone possible to apply to situations that are applicable only by the most tortuous logic. The FBI illegally wiretapped the phones of Americans, often falsely invoking terrorism emergencies, 3,500 times between 2002 and 2006 without a warrant. Internet surveillance and control will be no different. Official misuses are bad enough, but it's the unofficial uses that worry me more. Any surveillance and control system must itself be secured. An infrastructure conducive to surveillance and control invites surveillance and control, both by the people you expect and by the people you don't. China's hackers subverted the access system Google put in place to comply with U.S. intercept orders. Why does anyone think criminals won't be able to use the same system to steal bank account and credit card information, use it to launch other attacks or turn it into a massive spam-sending network? Why does anyone think that only authorized law enforcement can mine collected Internet data or eavesdrop on phone and IM conversations? These risks are not merely theoretical. After September 11, the NSA built a surveillance infrastructure to eavesdrop on telephone calls and e-mails within the U.S. Although procedural rules stated that only non-Americans and international phone calls were to be listened to, actual practice didn't match those rules. NSA analysts collected more data than they were authorized to and used the system to spy on wives, girlfriends and notables such as President Clinton. But that's not the most serious misuse of a telecommunications surveillance infrastructure. In Greece, between June 2004 and March 2005, someone wiretapped more than 100 cell phones belonging to members of the Greek government: the prime minister and the ministers of defense, foreign affairs and justice. Ericsson built this wiretapping capability into Vodafone's products and enabled it only for governments that requested it. Greece wasn't one of those governments, but someone still unknown -- A rival political party? Organized crime? Foreign intelligence? -- figured out how to surreptitiously turn the feature on. And surveillance infrastructure can be exported, which also aids totalitarianism around the world. Western companies like Siemens and Nokia built Iran's surveillance. U.S. companies helped build China's electronic police state. Just last year, Twitter's anonymity saved the lives of Iranian dissidents, anonymity that many governments want to eliminate. In the aftermath of Google's announcement, some members of Congress are reviving a bill banning U.S. tech companies from working with governments that digitally spy on their citizens. Presumably, those legislators don't understand that their own government is on the list. This problem isn't going away. Every year brings more Internet censorship and control, not just in countries like China and Iran but in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and other free countries, egged on by both law enforcement trying to catch terrorists, child pornographers and other criminals and by media companies trying to stop file sharers. The problem is that such control makes us all less safe. Whether the eavesdroppers are the good guys or the bad guys, these systems put us all at greater risk. Communications systems that have no inherent eavesdropping capabilities are more secure than systems with those capabilities built in. And it's bad civic hygiene to build technologies that could someday be used to facilitate a police state."}

{"id":340,"title":" NSA, GCHQ breached world's largest SIM provider to eavesdrop on calls worldwide","class":0,"body":" Documents leaked by Edward Snowden have showed that Britain's electronic spying agency, along with United States' National Security Agency, breached the networks of a Dutch company to seamlessly eavesdrop on mobile phones worldwide. A story about the documents posted on the website, The Intercept, said that the targeted Dutch company, Netherlands-based Gemalto, makes subscriber identity modules, or SIM cards, used in mobile phones and credit cards. One of the company's three global headquarters is located in Austin, Texas. Its clients include U.S. telcos AT and T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint, reported Stuff.co.nz. However, it provided no details on how the intelligence agencies employed the eavesdropping capability or if they misused it to spy on people who weren't valid intelligence targets. The story also offered no evidence of any eavesdropping against American customers of these service providers. Experts have termed the breach a major compromise of mobile phone security. The secret operation against the world's largest mobile phone data chips manufacturer has stoked anger worldwide and has fuelled an impression that the NSA and Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) will do whatever they deem necessary to further their surveillance prowess. The Intercept said that the GCHQ successfully intercepted keys used by wireless network providers in Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, India, Serbia, Iceland and Tajikistan in 2010. However, the agency faced troubles breaking into Pakistani networks.

{"id":341,"title":"The Government Must Show Us the Evidence That North Korea Attacked Sony","class":0,"body":" When you’re attacked by a missile, you can follow its trajectory back to where it was launched from. When you’re attacked in cyberspace, figuring out who did it is much harder. The reality of international aggression in cyberspace will change how we approach defense. Many of us in the computer-security field are skeptical of the U.S. government’s claim that it has positively identified North Korea as the perpetrator of the massive Sony hack in November 2014. The FBI’s evidence is circumstantial and not very convincing. The attackers never mentioned the movie that became the centerpiece of the hack until the press did. More likely, the culprits are random hackers who have loved to hate Sony for over a decade, or possibly a disgruntled insider. On the other hand, most people believe that the FBI would not sound so sure unless it was convinced. And President Obama would not have imposed sanctions against North Korea if he weren’t convinced. This implies that there’s classified evidence as well. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote for the Atlantic, The NSA has been trying to eavesdrop on North Korea’s government communications since the Korean War, and it’s reasonable to assume that its analysts are in pretty deep. The agency might have intelligence on the planning process for the hack. It might, say, have phone calls discussing the project, weekly PowerPoint status reports, or even Kim Jong Un’s sign-off on the plan. On the other hand, maybe not. I could have written the same thing about Iraq’s weapons-of-mass-destruction program in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of that country, and we all know how wrong the government was about that. The NSA is extremely reluctant to reveal its intelligence capabilities — or what it refers to as sources and methods — against North Korea simply to convince all of us of its conclusion, because by revealing them, it tips North Korea off to its insecurities. At the same time, we rightly have reason to be skeptical of the government’s unequivocal attribution of the attack without seeing the evidence. Iraq’s mythical weapons of mass destruction is only the most recent example of a major intelligence failure. American history is littered with examples of claimed secret intelligence pointing us toward aggression against other countries, only for us to learn later that the evidence was wrong. Cyberspace exacerbates this in two ways. First, it is very difficult to attribute attacks in cyberspace. Packets don’t come with return addresses, and you can never be sure that what you think is the originating computer hasn’t itself been hacked. Even worse, it’s hard to tell the difference between attacks carried out by a couple of lone hackers and ones where a nation-state military is responsible. When we do know who did it, it’s usually because a lone hacker admitted it or because there was a months-long forensic investigation. Second, in cyberspace, it is much easier to attack than to defend. The primary defense we have against military attacks in cyberspace is counterattack and the threat of counterattack that leads to deterrence. What this all means is that it’s in the U.S.’s best interest to claim omniscient powers of attribution. More than anything else, those in charge want to signal to other countries that they cannot get away with attacking the U.S.: If they try something, we will know. And we will retaliate, swiftly and effectively. This is also why the U.S. has been cagey about whether it caused North Korea’s Internet outage in late December. It can be an effective bluff, but only if you get away with it. Otherwise, you lose credibility. The FBI is already starting to equivocate, saying others might have been involved in the attack, possibly hired by North Korea. If the real attackers surface and can demonstrate that they acted independently, it will be obvious that the FBI and NSA were overconfident in their attribution. Already, the FBI has lost significant credibility. The only way out of this, with respect to the Sony hack and any other incident of cyber-aggression in which we’re expected to support retaliatory action, is for the government to be much more forthcoming about its evidence. The secrecy of the NSA’s sources and methods is going to have to take a backseat to the public’s right to know. And in cyberspace, we’re going to have to accept the uncomfortable fact that there’s a lot we don’t know.

At the moment, ministers in the UK are allowed to give the go ahead on the surveillance warrants without judicial input. The report states that the current system of granting warrants is lacking in legal clarity and says the ISR Panel believe the system requires a radical overhaul which must include an enhanced role for the judiciary. Last month, the Anderson surveillance review came to the same conclusion. Surveillance practices in the UK have been under scrutiny since the revelation that GCHQ and the NSA had been snooping on citizens prior to December 2014. At the beginning of the year, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled that GCHQ had unlawfully accessed millions of personal communications collected by the NSA. However, the review published today states that it found no evidence that the British government knowingly acts illegally in intercepting private communications, so it will be interesting to see what new surveillance legislation is brought forward in the Investigatory Powers Bill this autumn."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":343,"title":" Report: German spy agency snooped on Fabius, FBI, UN bodies","class":0,"body":" The revelations broadcast by rbb-Inforadio on Wednesday add to a growing list of friendly targets the BND intelligence service allegedly spied on. Without identifying the source of its claims, the Berlin-based radio station said the agency had eavesdropped on the International Criminal Court in The Hague, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and a German diplomat. Also on the list were many European and American companies, including weapons makers such as Lockheed of the United States, the report said. In a possible violation of the constitution, the BND allegedly monitored Hansjoerg Haber, a German diplomat who headed a European Union observer mission to Georgia from 2008 to 2011. Spying on German citizens is only allowed with permission from a special commission. Haber is now the head of the EU's mission in Turkey. Sources told German press agency DPA that Haber and Fabius may have been targeted because of their work as diplomats with international organizations that might have been considered fair game for spying. BND officials have declined to comment on the report, but the parliamentary committee that oversees Germany's intelligence gathering bodies was due to meet later in the day. Government spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz also declined to comment directly on the allegations. However, she told reporters at a regular press conference in Berlin that the duties of the BND do not include political reconnaissance work against partner countries. She added that the claims would be comprehensively investigated and that BND chief Gerhard Schindler still had the full confidence of the German government. Privacy has been hotly debated in Germany since revelations about the extent of the US National Security Agency's spying activities were leaked by its former contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. Snowden's leaks revealed widespread US surveillance in Germany, including the bugging of Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone. Following those reports, Merkel angrily told Washington that spying among friends isn't on. The scandal deepened earlier this year with allegations the BND had indirectly helped the NSA spy on politicians and business in Europe, including the French government, the European Commission and Airbus Group. A parliamentary oversight committee is currently investigating whether the BND overstepped its legal boundaries. Last month, Justice Minister Heiko Maas called for tighter controls on the agency after reports its spies had also targeted embassies of allied countries without the government's express permission. The spying scandals have created unease in Germany, where citizens were subject to extensive surveillance by Communist East Germany's Stasi secret police and by the Nazi-era Gestapo."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":344,"title":"The NSA’s eyes in Europe","class":0,"body":" BERLIN — Flashback to the autumn of 2013. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, stands before dozens of journalists at the beginning of a European summit in Brussels. They all want to hear what she has to say about the claims that the National Security Agency (NSA) tapped her mobile phone. The chancellor, dressed in her customary monotone fashion, says a few words that will resonate in Germany and abroad. Spying among friends is not at all acceptable, she declares, as Washington and Berlin face one of their biggest crises of trust in recent times. Fast forward to May 2015. Merkel is again standing before a crowd of reporters, this time in Berlin, accompanied by Czech prime minister Bohuslav Sobotka. The NSA is once more a key issue on the agenda, but the chancellor is not being questioned as a target of US espionage, but rather as one of its enablers. In question is the alleged cooperation between the German and American intelligence services in spying on European officials and even private companies, and whether both countries surpassed their legal limits in doing so. Merkel reiterates her previous argument, that friends should not spy on each other, but also stresses that intelligence agencies can only be effective if they work together, especially in the light of the current terror threats worldwide. In the German case, that cooperation occurs with hundreds of intelligence services worldwide, but mainly with the NSA. The backdrop to Merkel’s words is the claim that the country’s foreign intelligence agency, the BND, or Bundesnachrichtendienst, spied on European companies like Airbus, as well as on the French government and the European Commission. More importantly, the spying at BND facilities in Germany allegedly took place at the behest of the NSA, the same organization that was previously accused of tapping the chancellor’s phone. BND head Gerhard Schindler denied that the agency had been a compliant tool of the US, but this has not stopped many from questioning, once again, the nature and scope of US-German intelligence cooperation. It should be stressed that Germany and the US vowed long ago to work together closely on intelligence matters, in particular after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US. In 2002, the two countries signed a cooperation agreement and, at least officially, the search for terrorist threats remains a key component of the deal. But the current controversy has put chancellor Merkel under a great deal of pressure. The reason is straightforward: although she does not control every single movement of the BND, she is indeed responsible for supervising its activities. A whole department in her chancellery is tasked precisely with that duty. This simple fact begs a question that has been circulating in German political and media circles: how much does Merkel actually know about the cooperation between the NSA and the BND when it came to snooping on European targets that might be considered friends of Germany? The details, as with many intelligence operations around the world, are murky and may well remain so. Secrecy is, after all, paramount in these kinds of procedures. But the latest revelations have not prevented the chancellor and some of her closest advisors from being on the receiving end of some strong words of disapproval for what is being described as sloppy oversight or even a complete failure, as Der Spiegel put it. A picture in tabloid newspaper Bild of interior minister Thomas de Maizière, a member of Merkel’s centre-right CDU party who was directly responsible for the BND when he served as chief of staff at the chancellery between 2005 and 2009, showed him with an elongated nose, as if he were Pinocchio. Although de Maizière denies any wrongdoing, there has been pressure on him to step down. The controversy has also revealed some cracks in the coalition that Merkel has led since she was easily re-elected in 2013. Prominent members of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior party in the coalition, were quick to distance themselves from both the chancellor and the whole affair, in a move that could benefit them politically if the scandal keeps growing. SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel, who is the economy minister and vice chancellor, not only demanded a thorough inquiry but also mentioned an issue that is particularly sensitive in Germany: the possibility that the BND was involved in economic or industrial espionage. Any hint of surveillance is already a delicate issue in a country that has been trying for decades to heal the wounds caused by the secret police services in both Nazi Germany and, later, the German Democratic Republic. But the controversy will deepen should it implicate the economy or key industries, which have been at the forefront of Germany’s prowess since the fall of the Berlin Wall. No wonder Gabriel stressed that if the claims are indeed true and Germany helped the US to snoop on companies, the scandal will place a big strain on the economy’s faith in the government’s behavior. This, in turn, could seriously affect Merkel, who now has to decide whether she will bow to local political pressure and release the list of surveillance targets, a move that Washington would almost certainly oppose. In Germany Merkel enjoys a certain aura of being an untouchable leader, and she has presented herself as a safe pair of hands that Germans can trust. This was, in fact, one of her campaign slogans in 2013, when it appeared on a massive billboard right next to Berlin’s central station. Here in Germany some refer to her as Mutti, a German diminutive of mother. But that image could soon start to become tarnished if Merkel is seen as a chancellor who gives too much weight to foreign interests, who lacks proper oversight mechanisms or who stands by ministers who are portrayed as liars. Some are already saying that this issue marks a turning point and could even affect the outcome of the next general elections, due in 2017. That argument may be a bit far-fetched. After all, two years in politics is a long time, as Merkel knows all too well. She only has to remember that statement in Brussels in 2013, when she was seen as a victim of US espionage. Thomas Sparrow is a journalist currently based in Berlin. He previously was a BBC correspondent in Washington, and has also lived in Poland, Spain and Colombia."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":345,"title":" How the NSA may be using games to encourage digital snooping","class":0,"body":" German magazine Der Spiegel on Wednesday posted a new cache of documents related to National Security Agency surveillance activities within Germany. Among the trove is a report that sheds new light on how the U.S. government may be using games to motivate analysts using XKeyscore, a tool for searching through online data that the agency collects that was revealed last year by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. XKeyscore allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing emails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals around the world according to a Guardian story published last summer. A document published by Der Spiegel describes an XKeyscore training at the NSA's European Cryptologic Center, revealing that analysts may also be rewarded for their exploration within the system with something called Skilz points. It's unclear from the report exactly how the Skilz points system works, but from these snippets it sounds pretty similar to the reward systems found in many video gaming platforms -- earning points and leveling up. The NSA declined to comment specifically on Skilz points or the agency's use of gamification in response to a Washington Post inquiry. Instead, the agency shared a statement sent to Der Spiegel that defends XKeyscore as a tool with stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels and noted that President Obama had signed a directive in January affirming that all persons regardless of nationality have a privacy interest in their personal information that the U.S. will take into account when planning signals intelligence operations. But based on the feedback detailed in the report, it seems like the Skilz points system was pretty successful at getting analysts to dig deeper into the agency's vast data troves. The NSA is required by law to obtain an individualized Foreign Intelligence Surveillance warrant if targeting a U.S. person, although such restrictions do not apply when the NSA is snooping on communications between an American and a foreign target. However, the Guardian claimed that XKeyscore provided the technical capability, if not legal authority, to target Americans without a warrant if the analyst had identifying information about them -- such as an e-mail or IP address. According to job postings, the tool seems to have been in use at least through last fall."}

The top secret document, obtained by The Hindu, suggests American spying activity in the sub-continent has gone far beyond that claimed by US and Indian officials. Washington has said in the past that any snooping programs were only done as a counter terrorism measure, and that the content of emails and telephone conversations was never accessed. India’s IT minister Kapil Sibal reiterated these statements in August, claiming US agencies only tap the origin and destination of comms data because to access content would require a local court order. However, the document seen by The Hindu apparently proves that India was a target of the NSA’s infamous PRISM program, with US spooks tapping internet service providers including Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook for politically and commercially sensitive content. Dubbed A Week in the Life of PRISM reporting, the Special Source Operations document apparently shows 589 end product reports distilled from raw intelligence across the globe, with a specific section on India. As politics, space and nuclear are mentioned as ‘end products’ in this document, it means that emails, texts and phones of important people related to these fields were constantly monitored and intelligence was taken from them, and then the NSA prepared official reports on the basis of raw intelligence, an anonymous Indian intelligence agency official told the paper. It means, they are listening in real time to what our political leaders, bureaucrats and scientists are communicating with each other. It would appear that the NSA is using the controversial FISA Amendment Act, which allows for the acquisition of foreign intelligence, to circumvent any requirement for court order approval in order to tap internet content connected with targets abroad. If accurate, these latest revelations will no doubt undermine yet another important geopolitical alliance the US had. Internet users in the sub-continent are no strangers to this kind of revelation, of course, although its usually their own government in the dock. Earlier this month media reports claimed New Delhi was guilty of carrying out wide-ranging and indiscriminate internet surveillance of its citizens."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":347,"title":"Private investigator snooped on e-mail of Scientology critics [Updated]","class":0,"body":" This afternoon, Eric Saldarriaga, a private investigator from Astoria, New York, will be sentenced in federal court for his part in a conspiracy to hack into the e-mail accounts of more than 50 individuals as part of his investigations. (He has pled guilty.) Among his victims are two prominent critics of the Church of Scientology, both of whom were recently featured in the book and HBO documentary film Going Clear. Update: Saldarriaga received a sentence of three months imprisonment, three years of supervised probation, and a $1,000 fine—in addition to forfeiture of $5,000 he received in fees for hacking at least one account. Who were Saldarriaga's clients? That remains unclear; court documents haven't revealed it, and the transcripts of his guilty plea are still held by the court awaiting redaction. But both Scientology critics are now convinced that it was the church which set Saldarriaga on them. There can be no doubt that one of Mr. Saldarriaga’s clients is Scientology, Mike Rinder, a former Scientology official and one of the victims notified by the US Attorney's Office, said in a written statement sent to the court. Ars attempted to get a comment from a church of Scientology spokesperson, but did not receive a response in time for publication. We will update this story if we receive comment. Here's how the hacks happened. According to a sentencing letter filed by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Between at least 2009 and March 2014, through certain services advertised on the Internet (the 'Hacking Services'), the defendant hired other individuals to hack into, i.e., to gain unlawful and secret electronic access to, the e-mail accounts of almost 50 different individuals (collectively, the 'Victims'). For certain victims, the defendant attempted to gain unlawful access to more than one e-mail account. In total, the defendant hired the Hacking Services to attempt to hack into, and provide the defendant with unauthorized access to, at least 60 different e-mail accounts. The government has not named the individuals hired by Saldarriaga to perform the mail hacking, but it describes them as known and unknown—so cases against them are likely pending. Saldarriaga, who also used the alias Emmanuela Gelpi in Internet communications, would contact the Hacking Services by e-mail to request the username and password for specific targets' accounts; when successful, the hackers would e-mail back a screenshot of the targets' e-mail inbox and demand payment, usually via PayPal. They would then pass along the login credentials for the e-mail account, and Saldarriaga would log in—sometimes to gather information for clients, and sometimes to investigate individuals in which the defendant was interested for personal reasons, Assistant US Attorney Daniel Noble wrote in his sentencing memorandum to the court. The government stated in its sentencing memorandum that Saldarriaga lied to the court in his guilty plea—including lying about having a New York State investigator's license. The website for his investigative firm, Iona Research Services, Inc. (now just a blank page), previously promoted Saldarriaga's business as providing Internet Profiling, E-mail Tracing, and Computer Security services. It also used an Investigator's License number associated with another investigator in Rockland County, New York. One of the targeted e-mail accounts belonged to Tony Ortega, executive editor of The Raw Story and former editor of The Village Voice. Ortega, who has written about the Church of Scientology since 1995, has written a book about the church's campaign against the author Paulette Cooper. In an interview with Ars, Ortega said that he first became aware of Saldarriaga in 2013 when he started receiving read receipts for e-mails sent from an account associated with his Web domain. Saldarriaga had been sending messages from an account that was set up to look like it belonged to Ortega. The e-mails sent by Saldarriaga used a Point-of-mail account, which allowed him to track when they were read. But he had mistakenly configured his account to send read receipts back to Ortega—as well as to his fake account. He screwed up, said Ortega. Otherwise I'd have never caught him. After tracking the messages back to Saldarriaga in November 2013, Ortega said, I contacted him and said, 'What the hell?' He said that he had been hacked too, and that some other private investigator was using the two of us to investigate some missing persons thing. Saldarriaga said he believed that both of them were being punked by a former client of his. I asked him point blank if this was Scientology, and he said no, Ortega said. Saldarriaga insisted that he would never work for Scientology. After getting assurances from his lawyer—who is also his webmaster—that his website's server had not been breached, Ortega says he wrote off the whole episode. That is, until recently, when he received a letter from the Justice Department informing him that he had been determined to be a victim of Saldarriaga's hacking operations. Ortega was given the opportunity to write a Victim Impact Statement for Saldiarraga's sentencing hearing. Ortega's attorney, Scott Pilutik, wrote to Peter Brill, the attorney representing Saldarriaga, again asking why Saldarriaga had used Ortega's e-mail address in an investigation. Brill responded by phone, telling Pilutik that the client was the father of a missing person named Jay Banarjee. He told Pilutik again that there was no connection between the case and the Church of Scientology. But then Ortega spoke with Mike Rinder, a former international spokesperson for the Church of Scientology who left the group in 2007, and everything changed. Rinder, who had also acted as a confidential informant to the FBI in a human-trafficking investigation against the church, told Ortega that he had just been notified by the Justice Department that his e-mail had been hacked by some private investigator. Ortega asked him if the investigator was Saldarriaga; Rinder, surprised, replied that it was. So both men filed victim impact statements with the Justice Department, pressing the government to pursue charges against Saldarriaga's clients—convinced that the Church of Scientology was involved.  Rinder has some familiarity with that pattern of behavior, as Mike Rinder used to run these operations, said Ortega. While with the church of Scientology's SEA ORG, Rinder has claimed that he was responsible for initiating private investigations against former Scientology members, the family members of church members, and others. In his victim statement, Ortega told the court, It is disturbing to me that I have been given no information about the extent of Mr. Saldarriaga's access to me, and for whom he was working, given that Mr. Brill's representation on behalf of Mr. Saldarriaga were evidently not truthful. Sentencing Mr. Saldarriaga without pressing him for this information would be as much of a miscarriage of justice as his original crime. Whoever paid Mr. Saldarriaga should be investigated and prosecuted. According to filings from the US Attorney's office, investigators have not yet been able to determine the identities of all of the victims of Saldarriaga's e-mail incursions. On May 1, Assistant US Attorney Noble filed a request for subpoenas with the court to obtain basic subscriber information from various service providers for the e-mail accounts the government has identified as being possibly compromised as a result of the defendant's conduct."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":348,"title":"Secret documents show UK hacked Israeli jets and drones for 18 years","class":0,"body":" The British government has been hacking into Israeli military jets and drones for 18 years after bypassing their security, secret documents have revealed. Get The Jewish News's Weekly Edition by email and never miss our top stories   FREE SIGN UP! The UK eavesdropping centre GCHQ, together with America’s NSA, snooped on the Israelis during military operations over Gaza and Lebanon after accessing its supposedly-secure aircraft, according to leaked documents from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. A senior Israeli intelligence source reportedly told Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that the revelations were an earthquake and the biggest breach in the history of Israeli intelligence. Under a top-secret programme called ‘Anarchist,’ the British and Americans tapped into Israeli live feeds from an RAF listening centre in Cyprus, hacking the video cameras of the jets and drones and tracking their flight paths. In essence, U.S. and British agencies stole a bird’s-eye view, said Cora Currier and Henrik Moltke, analysts with The Intercept, an online news agency through which Snowden’s files are being leaked. Through Anarchist, the Americans and British kept tabs on the Israelis for years, monitoring their drone technology, watching their conduct over Gaza and even analysing their activity vis-a-vis Iranian nuclear sites and personnel. Several grainy images also appear to show Israeli drones flying armed with missiles, despite the Israeli army never having acknowledged carrying out drone attacks. The British listening centre in Cyprus captures conversations and data from across the Middle East and North Africa, and the site has been used for weapons tracking, including the tracking of Israeli missile systems. A GCHQ document from 2008 reads: This access is indispensable for maintaining an understanding of Israeli military training and operations and thus an insight to possible future developments in the region. In times of crisis this access is critical and one of the only avenues to provide up to the minute information and support to U.S. and Allied operations in the area. Analysts say the revelations underscore a level of mutual mistrust between Israel, the U.K and the U.S, despite Israel and the U.S having signed a 2009 Memorandum of Understanding granting Israel access to raw NSA data."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":349,"title":" U.S allies fume as new National Security Agency snooping allegations reveal agency collected data on their citizens ","class":0,"body":" Angry French officials on Monday summoned the U.S. ambassador to the Foreign Ministry in Paris, the latest example of new snooping allegations by the National Security Agency infuriating American allies. Records provided by NSA contractor-turned-fugitive Edward Snowden to French newspaper Le Monde revealed that the NSA collected 70.3 million French telephone records over a 30-day period that began last Dec. 10. The French government called the surveillance totally unacceptable and asked U.S. Ambassador Charles Rivkin for an explanation. This sort of practice between partners that invades privacy is totally unacceptable and we have to make sure, very quickly, that this no longer happens, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said. Rivkin's boss, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, is scheduled to meet Tuesday in France with Fabius. The meeting was scheduled to address the Syrian civil war, but is now also expected to address the snooping allegations. France is not the only U.S. ally upset by surveillance allegations. Mexico on Sunday blasted a report in a German magazine that in 2010 the U.S. snooped on communications by then-Mexican president Felipe Calderon. The report spurred German Chancellor Angela Merkel to cancel a program dating to the Cold War under which her government monitors individuals in the country at the request of the U.S. and Britain in order to protect American and British troops stationed there. Snowden has released a flood of NSA surveillance records since June, including the U.S. government's wholesale collection of phone call logs, and the NSA's ability to tap into the central servers of major U.S. tech and Internet firms. Snowden, 30, now enjoys asylum in Russia but is under indictment at home for theft and disclosure of government secrets. Earlier, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported that in 2012 the NSA read then-Mexican presidential candidate Enrique Pena Nieto's email prior to his election as the country's head of state. Last month, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff cancelled an official visit to Washington to meet with President Obama after a Snowden leak revealed the NSA snooped on communications between her and top aides and collected data on billions of phone calls and e-mails in her country."}

The Investigatory Powers Tribunal has decided that GCHQ broke knowledge retention guidelines when it spied on civil rights teams in Egypt and South Africa. The company legally intercepted the communications of those two targets, based on the ruling, nevertheless it both stored that knowledge longer than it ought to have (within the Egyptian circumstance) or did not comply with insurance policies for learning that knowledge (in South Africa). It is one other victory for advocates who’ve lengthy thought that GCHQ’s practices are questionable. With that stated, it will not carry as a lot weight as a February determination which maintained that a number of the group’s conduct is against the law. The transfer does not put GCHQ in authorized scorching water, and the injury supposedly is not vital sufficient to benefit compensation. Additionally, the decision shoots down claims from the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty Worldwide and different teams that got here beneath GCHQ scrutiny. Nevertheless, the findings reinforce worries that the spy outfit is often bending the principles (together with its personal) within the identify of nationwide safety — and that folks in different nations are paying the worth."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":351,"title":" NSA Poking Around Antivirus Software","class":0,"body":" U.S. and U.K. security agencies aren't just interested in your phone calls and naked pics. They also want to crack antivirus software, according to The Intercept. Citing the documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, The Intercept says that the National Security Agency (NSA) and the U.K.'s GCHQ have reverse-engineered popular antivirus software in order to exploit bugs, but also monitored the Web and email activity of antivirus firms to learn about new vulnerabilities and malware. One name that kept coming up over and over was Kaspersky. U.K. officials had a particularly tough time trying to crack Kaspersky software, and requested a warrant in 2008 in order to reverse engineer the company's technology. As The Intercept explained, reverse engineering of software is often forbidden by licensing agreements and, in some cases, laws. So GCHQ requested a warrant. It is unclear what GCHQ accomplished in its analysis of Kaspersky software, but GCHQ has repeatedly reverse engineered software to discover vulnerabilities, The Intercept said. Rather than report the vulnerabilities to the companies, spy agencies have quietly stockpiled numerous exploits for a wide range of commercial hardware and software, using them to hack adversaries. Across the pond, meanwhile, the NSA also had an interest in Kaspersky. In 2008, they found that its software was transmitting information that might reveal who was using Kaspersky software and allow for tracking of those users. Kaspersky told The Intercept that is not the case, however. The agencies, meanwhile, were also snooping on email activity, keeping an eye out for messages that discussed new bugs. Antivirus firms can sometimes be slow to patch these vulnerabilities, particularly if they are not public, so the NSA and GCHQ were looking for mentions of things they could exploit, even temporarily. An NSA presentation listed 23 AV firms on a slide titled More Targets, including Bit-Defender, F-Secure, Avast, AVG, and Avira. Kaspersky, however, has been a particular thorn in the agency's side, as it has uncovered a number of sophisticated, state-sponsored attacks linked to the U.S., including Flame, Gauss, and Equation Group. Earlier this month, Kaspersky said it had been hacked, probably by a nation state. Kaspersky said the attackers—believed to be the same group behind 2011's Stuxnet-like Duqu worm—were mainly interested in spying on its technologies, especially its solutions for discovering and analyzing sophisticated attacks known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). The attackers were looking to find out about Kaspersky's ongoing investigations into advanced attacks, detection methods, and analysis capabilities."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":352,"title":" Why the NSA's snooping on BJP is legal according to US laws","class":0,"body":" After reports emerged of the United States of America's National Security Agency (NSA) spying on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2010, India has now summoned a senior US diplomat to seek an explanation. India has reacted strongly to the reports, saying that it was totally unacceptable that the privacy of an Indian organisation or Indian individual was transgressed upon. We expect a response to be provided to us, and if these are true, an assurance that this will not happen in the future, a senior government official said. The news first came out when new classified documents in the Washington Post revealed that the NSA had been snooping on 193 organisations and countries throughout the world, with India's BJP among them. Whistleblower Edward Snowden has revealed that the US gave permissions to spy on multiple political parties which included the BJP, the Pakistan People's Party and Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. The BJP see this as a gross violation of India's privacy and sovereignty as a democratic nation. But as per the NSA mandates, it had complete authority to spy on BJP as it was approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, although one cannot be sure if the spying was actually carried out. The first time the bipartisan Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board dissected a National Security Agency surveillance program, it found fundamental flaws, arguing in a January report that the NSA's collection of domestic calling records lacked a viable legal foundation and should be shut down. Read More. However the five-member board appointed by President Barack Obama, released a report on Tuesday night, related to the latest controversies brought on by the espionage organisation. The committee this time, largely endorsed various surveillance programs undertaken by the NSA. This added to the already prevalent worldwide apprehension about the NSA brought on by former systems administrator Edward Snowden. They did however make one thing clear to the agency. They urged the NSA to implement new intelligence agency safeguards, primarily to safeguard against internal and external infiltration and misuse. The oversight board voted on Wednesday, and found that the NSA's collection of Internet data within the United States passes constitutional muster and employs reasonable safeguards designed to protect the rights of Americans. The board, whose members were appointed by President Barack Obama, largely endorsed a set of NSA surveillance programs that have provoked worldwide controversy since Snowden disclosed them. However, the board's report said some aspects of the programs raise privacy concerns meriting new internal intelligence agency safeguards. Under a provision of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act known as Section 702, the NSA uses various methods like court orders and fiber optic taps to target information on foreigners living abroad including all correspondence via electronic mail, web chats, text and basically any kind of electronic communications. Now, this is supposed to be only for those communications that transverse through US channels, but the fact of the matter, indicated by these reports, is that the buck does not in fact stop there. Section 702, was added to the act in 2008, and the the coveted PRISM program allows the NSA to collect foreign intelligence from social media platforms like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and any other major America internet company. While a majority of US congressmen and intelligence officials agree that Section 702 has been pivotal in the foiling of terrorist plots and achieving other security goals, is giving free reign to one intelligence agency smart in the long run? The board released a statement claiming that the agency has helped the government identify previously unknown individuals who are involved in international terrorism, and it has played a key role in discovering and disrupting specific terrorist plots aimed at the United States as well as other countries. Many have raised questions about the surveillance organisation, and have condemned its methods, but as per US mandate, it is completely legal. Regarding the recent information that was brought to light about other countries being surveilled as well, India has sought an assurance from the US that it will not happen again. However, so far officials have not disclosed which US diplomat was summoned by the External Affairs Ministry. It should be noted that India had also raised these issues with the US administration in Washington and the Embassy issues before. Most recently in November last year, when reports emerged that the NSA had spied upon individuals and entities. However they are still awaiting a response from America on this. Reacting to reports that America's National Security Agency (NSA) was allowed by a US court to spy on six political parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), BJP IT Cell Head Arvind Gupta said it is a matter of great concern, and added that the party will take up this issue with the appropriate authority. If this report is true, it is a matter of great concern. It is matter of concern because it deals with the interfering of a democratic process of a sovereign nation. At the BJP, we are quite concerned about it, said Gupta."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":353,"title":" Cybersecurity Without NSA Snooping: Does the White House Proposal Provide the Protections We Need?","class":0,"body":" Earlier this week the White House released a legislative proposal aimed at enhancing cybersecurity by authorizing new information sharing between the private sector and the government. The White House proposal contains important privacy protections not present in CISPA and CISA – bills which ignored the public outcry for reform of NSA surveillance over Americans. However, the White House proposal relies heavily on privacy guidelines and use restrictions that are currently unwritten, leaving unanswered questions about their effectiveness. The White House proposal would require companies to take reasonable steps to filter out information related to innocent persons before sharing it for cybersecurity purposes. This front-end protection is a critical distinction from CISPA, the House bill passed just prior to the Snowden disclosures. The White House proposal also requires federal agencies to establish privacy procedures for the disclosure, receipt, use, and retention of information shared for cybersecurity. The White House proposal also takes a key step forward from CISPA in requiring application of privacy guidelines before sharing with agencies outside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – including the NSA – can occur. This is an another important distinction from CISPA, which permits real-time sharing of communications with NSA. Required application of privacy protections in favor of real-time or automatic sharing within government should be a foundation for cybersecurity proposals in Congress. However, these privacy protections – destruction of irrelevant information, anonymizing information retained, and penalties for privacy violations – have yet to be developed by DHS and other federal agencies. The White House’s proposal does not elaborate on what specific privacy policies and procedures must be established, nor does the proposal set a timeline for their implementation. What these procedures ultimately require and when they are enacted will determine whether the information sharing system is protective of privacy, or whether it is essentially a backdoor wiretap. This is disappointing because it means, in practice, the White House proposal could be an inch or a mile from CISPA in protecting Americans’ communications. Greater clarity and guarantees of privacy protection are needed before any information sharing should begin. New cybersecurity policy should not force Internet users to choose between being hacked by cyber criminals and being snooped on by NSA. Funneling Americans’ shared communications to NSA, as CISPA would permit, is not only problematic for privacy, it also appears unnecessary for security. During a House Intelligence Committee hearing on cybersecurity last November, NSA Director Mike Rogers stated that in the context of network defense, This is not what we want to see. I don’t want to see people’s personal data, and that including such information in cyber threats shared would be a negative for us. It will lead to a slower sharing of information. The White House proposal allows law enforcement to use information shared for cybersecurity for other purposes. Specifically, law enforcement can use shared information for investigation and prosecution of 1) computer crimes, 2) threats of death or serious bodily harm, 3) serious threats to minors, or 4) conspiracy charges for those offenses. This is a strong improvement over the White House’s 2011 proposal. However, there are still significant issues that should be addressed. Computer crime is undefined, there is no requirement that the threat of bodily harm be imminent, and the inclusion of conspiracy could implicate innocuous online communications. Further, the restrictions on law enforcement use must also be established through unwritten procedures with no timeline for enactment. As with the privacy procedures, the law enforcement use restrictions ought to be in place before information sharing begins. While the White House proposal requires companies to take reasonable efforts to remove PII before sharing it with the government, it is unclear whether this protection applies broadly enough. The proposal only requires companies to take any steps to strip PII of individuals reasonably believed to be unrelated to the cyber threat. This could leave victims and individuals whose computers are co-opted to spread attacks – who are certainly related to the threat – unprotected. Legislation should require reasonable efforts to strip out irrelevant PII of all individuals other than perpetrators of a cyber attack. The White House proposal is considerably more privacy protective than other major cybersecurity legislation in play, such as CISPA and CISA. Still, more can and must be done if we are to develop policy on cybersecurity that ensures Internet users online activities are safe, secure, and private."}

{"id":355,"title":"Snowden docs reveal British spies snooped on YouTube and Facebook","class":0,"body":"The British government can tap into the cables carrying the world’s web traffic at will and spy on what people are doing on some of the world’s most popular social media sites, including YouTube, all without the knowledge or consent of the companies. Documents taken from the National Security Agency by Edward Snowden and obtained by NBC News detail how British cyber spies demonstrated a pilot program to their U.S. partners in 2012 in which they were able to monitor YouTube in real time and collect addresses from the billions of videos watched daily, as well as some user information, for analysis. At the time the documents were printed, they were also able to spy on Facebook and Twitter. Called Psychology A New Kind of SIGDEV (Signals Development), the presentation includes a section that spells out Broad real-time monitoring of online activity of YouTube videos, URLs liked on Facebook, and Blogspot/Blogger visits. The monitoring program is called Squeaky Dolphin. Experts told NBC News the documents show the British had to have been either physically able to tap the cables carrying the world’s web traffic or able to use a third party to gain physical access to the massive stream of data, and would be able to extract some key data about specific users as well. Representatives of Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, said they hadn’t given the British government permission to access data and were unaware the collection had occurred. A source close to Google who asked not to be identified when discussing company policy said the company was shocked to learn the U.K. could have been grabbing its data. In connection with this report, NBC is publishing documents that Edward Snowden took from the NSA before fleeing the U.S., which can be viewed by clicking here. The documents are being published with minimal redactions. One of the people who helped prepare the demonstration was an official from the British signals intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) who worked for a division of the agency called GTE, or Global Telecoms Exploitation. GTE has already been shown in other documents released by Snowden to be tapping fiber optic cables around the world. In 2013, the Guardian reported that Snowden documents showed GCHQ was able to tap fiber optic cables and store huge amounts of data for 30 days, and that the government was placing intercept probes on transatlantic cables when they landed on British territory. Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that another Snowden document indicated major telecom firms, including BT, Verizon and Vodafone, were cooperating. The British cyber spies sometimes share their intercepted raw data and their analyses with their American counterparts. In October, the Washington Post revealed that a Snowden document dated Jan. 9, 2013, described a joint NSA/GCHQ program called MUSCULAR, in which the U.S. and British agencies shared intercepted data from fiber optic cables and copied entire data flows from Yahoo and Google. According to a source knowledgeable about the agency’s operations, the NSA does analysis of social media similar to that in the GCHQ demonstration. National security experts say that both the U.S. and British operations are within the scope of their respective national laws. When the Washington Post reported on the MUSCULAR program, the NSA said in a statement that it is focused on discovering and developing intelligence about valid foreign intelligence targets only and that it uses Attorney General-approved processes to protect the privacy of U.S. persons. But privacy experts and former government officials say the lack of disclosure by the intelligence agencies inspires public fear that rights of privacy, free speech and dissent have been infringed. Governments have no business knowing which YouTube videos everyone in the world is watching, said Chris Soghoian, chief technologist for the ACLU. It’s one thing to spy on a particular person who has done something to warrant a government investigation but governments have no business monitoring the Facebook likes or YouTube views of hundreds of millions of people. It might also have a chilling effect on companies like Google. Jason Healey, former White House cyber czar under George W. Bush, says U.S. and British intelligence encroachment on the internet is a threat to everyone, including social media companies. We want our security services to be out there and keeping us safe, said Healey, but we can also look for balance, we can look for limits, especially if we’re putting at risk this most transformative technology since Gutenberg. According to the documents obtained by NBC News, intelligence officers from GCHQ gave a demonstration in August 2012 that spelled out to their U.S. colleagues how the agency’s Squeaky Dolphin program could collect, analyze and utilize YouTube, Facebook and Blogger data in specific situations in real time. The demonstration showed that by using tools including a version of commercially available analytic software called Splunk, GCHQ could extract information from the torrent of electronic data that moves across fiber optic cable and display it graphically on a computer dashboard. The presentation showed that analysts could determine which videos were popular among residents of specific cities, but did not provide information on individual social media users. The presenters gave an example of their real-time monitoring capability, showing the Americans how they pulled trend information from YouTube, Facebook and blog posts on Feb. 13, 2012, in advance of an anti-government protest in Bahrain the following day. More than a year prior to the demonstration, in a 2012 annual report, members of Parliament had complained that the U.K.’s intelligence agencies had missed the warning signs of the uprisings that became the Arab Spring of 2011, and had expressed the wish to improve global intelligence collection. During the presentation, according to a note on the documents, the presenters noted for their audience that Squeaky Dolphin was not intended for spying on specific people and their internet behavior. The note reads, Not interested in individuals just broad trends! But cyber-security experts told NBC News that once the information has been collected, intelligence agencies have the ability to extract some user information as well. In 2010, according to other Snowden documents obtained by NBC News, GCHQ exploited unencrypted data from Twitter to identify specific users around the world and target them with propaganda. The experts also said that the only way that GCHQ would be able to do real-time analysis of trends would be to tap the cables directly and store the data or use a third party, like a private company, to extract and collect the raw data. As much as 11 percent of global internet bandwidth travels through U.K. internet exchanges, according to Bill Woodcock, president of PCH, a non-profit internet organization that tracks and measures and documents fiber infrastructure around the world. In the case of the YouTube video information, the surveillance of the unencrypted material was done not only without the knowledge of the public but without the knowledge or permission of Google, the U.S. company that owns the video sharing service. We have long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping, which is why we have continued to extend encryption across more and more Google services and links, said a Google spokesperson. We do not provide any government, including the UK government, with access to our systems. These allegations underscore the urgent need for reform of government surveillance practices. A source close to Google added that Google was shocked because the company had pushed back against British legislation that would have required Google to store its metadata and other information for U.K. government use. The legislation, introduced by Home Secretary Theresa May in 2012, was publicly repudiated by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in 2013 and has never become law. May hopes to reintroduce a modified version this spring. It’s extremely surprising, said the source, that while they were pushing for the data via the law, they might have simultaneously been using their capability to grab it anyway. Encryption would prevent simple collection of the data by an outside entity like the government. Google has not yet encrypted YouTube or Blogger. Facebook and Twitter have now fully encrypted all their data. Facebook confirmed to NBC News that while its like data was unencrypted, the company never gave it to the U.K. government and was unaware that GCHQ might have been siphoning the data. The company assumes the data was taken somewhere outside its networks and data centers. Network security is an important part of the way we protect user information, said Facebook spokesman Jay Nancarrow, which is why we finished moving our site traffic to HTTPS by default last year, implemented Perfect Forward Secrecy, and continue to strengthen all aspects of our network. GCHQ would not confirm or deny the existence of the Squeaky Dolphin program or anything else connected with this report. The agency declined to answer questions about the scope of its data collection or how it accessed the datastream. In a statement, a GCHQ spokesperson emphasized that that the agency operated within the law. All of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, said the statement, which ensure[s] that our activities are authorized, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the Secretary of State, the Interception and Intelligence Services Commissioners and the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee. All of our operational processes rigorously support this position. A spokesperson for the NSA said in a statement that the U.S. agency is not interested in the communications of people who are not valid foreign intelligence targets. Any implication that NSA's foreign intelligence collection is focused on the social media communications of everyday Americans is not true, said the statement. We collect only those communications that we are authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes – regardless of the technical means used by the targets. Because some data of U.S. persons may at times be incidentally collected in NSA’s lawful foreign intelligence mission, privacy protections for U.S. persons exist across the entire process concerning the use, handling, retention, and dissemination of data. The spokesperson also said that working with foreign intelligence services strengthens the national security of both nations, but that NSA can’t use those relationships to circumvent U.S. legal restrictions. Both U.S. and British officials assert that while their passive collection of electronic communications might have great breadth, the actual use of the data collected is very targeted, and is dictated by specific missions. Sources familiar with GCHQ operations state firmly that this is the case in each of the agency’s operations. Journalist Glenn Greenwald was formerly a columnist at Salon and the Guardian. In late 2012 he was contacted by NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who later provided him with thousands of sensitive documents, and he was the first to report on Snowden’s documents in June 2013 while on the staff of the Guardian. Greenwald has since reported on the documents with multiple media outlets around the world, and has won several journalism awards for his NSA reporting both in the U.S. and abroad. He is now helping launch, and will write for, a new, non-profit media outlet known as First Look Media that will encourage, support and empower … independent, adversarial journalists."}

Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, is spearheading the push, but there is serious skepticism within his leadership and in the House Republican Conference that he will be able to rally GOP lawmakers around a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force. --Some senior rank-and-file Republicans even wonder why he’s bringing the issue back to the forefront, with just a year left in President Barack Obama’s term … House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) will kick off the process in earnest Thursday when he begins a series of meetings with Republicans to gauge support — and potential tripwires — for a measure that would provide explicit congressional authorization for the battle against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL, or ISIS. From a practical sense, there are two main points of contention: Whether to bar widespread use of U.S. combat troops in Syria and Iraq, and placing limits on the time for American military operations. Many Democrats would like to explicitly prohibit Obama from sending combat forces into battle. http://goo.gl/Vyv93R --Flashback to Dec. 11 in CQ Roll Call, from Niels Lesniewski: Mitch McConnell: New War Authorization Not Happening Anytime Soon. http://goo.gl/GzKxpM OBAMACARE: THIS TIME, IT’S FOR REAL – Hill Republicans voted to repeal Obamacare – stop us if you’ve heard this before -- but now, it’s actually getting sent to the White House. Not only was the repeal a key messaging exercise, but could lay the groundwork for actually dismantling the law in 2017 if Republicans retain control of Congress and win the White House, as Jennifer Steinhauer explains: While Democrats dismissed the bill — which would also remove funding for Planned Parenthood — as another ploy in the partisan drama that has played out in the Capitol since the law was enacted in 2010, the vote proved that a Republican congressional majority could deliver a measure that repeals the health law to a Republican president, even in the face of united opposition from Democrats. -- ‘This is a big deal,’ said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington and a former longtime Republican staff member on the Senate Budget Committee … Even among Republicans, Mr. Hoagland said, ‘there is a recognition that you may not do away with a number of the provisions that are popular.’ But, he added, ‘if you can push away the politics of it, you will find there are a number of provisions that Democrats would agree could be changed,’ no matter who is president. http://goo.gl/MYaBLd LABRADOR: PAUL RYAN HONEYMOON ‘OVER’ – Honestly, this lasted longer than we thought it would. Lauren French for POLITICO: Rep. Raul Labrador — a leader in the House Freedom Caucus — said on Wednesday that Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has not yet transformed the House in the ways he promised during last fall's speaker elections. But unlike past battles between conservatives and leadership, there are no immediate calls for Ryan to step down or be removed from his post. -- ‘It's too early to judge the speakership of Paul Ryan and I think it is fundamentally unfair to try and judge the speakership of Paul Ryan over the last month or so. But, as I have also said, the honeymoon is over,’ said Labrador, an Idaho Republican … But Labrador added that Ryan has a year to push forward conservative legislation and further reform the House's rules and procedures before conservatives will really judge him. http://goo.gl/li0T3a HAPPY THURSDAY, Jan. 06, 2016 and you’re reading The Huddle, a newsletter that will be free of any birther speculation.

{"id":357,"title":" This is how hacked Israeli drone feeds look like","class":0,"body":" To date, it has always been reported that drones can potentially be hacked and a few cases where they, in fact, had been successfully hacked.  What we were never privy to were the detailed images of those hacked drones. However, thanks to The Intercept, this is no longer the case. The Intercept revealed that the United States National Security Agency (NSA) worked alongside British Intelligence Services, Governments Communication Headquarters (GCHQ), to systematically hack Israeli drones from within Cyprus. The respective agencies wanted to compile detailed information on Israeli operations in Gaza,  Palestine and Iran as well as to snoop on Israeli drone capabilities. Leaked documents which were provided by the whistle-blower Edward Snowden and reported by The Intercept show that under the auspices of the ‘Anarchist’ program, intelligence services of UK and USA collected snapshot images from Israeli drones along with mapping data detailing paths taken. These detailed images were all collected between 2009 and 2010 although The Intercept noted that Intelligence reports from GCHQ and NSA extended prior to and beyond these dates (2008-2012) as reported by the JPost. On January 28, 2010, GCHQ analysts on Cyprus captured six minutes of video from what appears to be a Heron TP, a giant drone manufactured by the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). This is another image taken from a Heron TP, intercepted on February 9, 2010. The Heron TP or Eitan (meaning strong or steadfast) has an 85-foot wingspan, can carry a 1-ton load, and can stay aloft for up to 36 hours. It has been described in the press as the drone that can reach Iran. This snapshot from a 14-second-long video dated July 13, 2009, was recorded at 4:51 in the morning, and shows what appears to be an Aerostar Tactical UAV flying at low altitude. Another snapshot shows what appears to be the landing gear of a drone. Sweetman, of Aviation Week, suggested that it was an Aerostar Tactical UAV. Anarchist also tracked the location of drones. This map shows movement data collected on June 24, 2009, from an Israeli drone of an unspecified type. Several locations are recorded, including one north of Nablus, a city in the West Bank, and another further southwest in the West Bank. This image comes from a PowerPoint presentation and shows a video still from an Iranian-made Ababil III drone flying out of western Syria. The signal was captured by Anarchist analysts and recorded on March 11, 2012. This image is from a March 2008 internal NSA newsletter celebrating the successful capture of video from the cockpit of an Israeli F-16 during unrest in the Gaza Strip. The newsletter describes a 14-second-long video captured on January 3, 2008, which showed an ‘unbroken line’ running through the targeting display, indicating that the target being tracked was on the ground. On that same day, Israeli airstrikes and shelling from tanks reportedly killed nine people in Gaza. This blurred image was recorded on August 25, 2009, the same day that news agencies reported that the IDF bombed a smuggler tunnel in Gaza, killing three Palestinians inside. According to an Anarchist document, the signal was too poor to process further. This image was intercepted early on the morning of January 7, 2010. Based on the display markings, like the dial in the upper right-hand corner, it appears to be from a drone made by the company Aeronautics. (This video from the manufacturer shows a similar view.) The image indicates that this model was equipped with Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) camera. This is an IAI Searcher MK III, according to Sweetman. The Searcher was developed in the 1980s, but is still used by the Israel Defense Forces and by a number of other countries. This snapshot from a 14-second-long video dated July 13, 2009, was recorded at 4:51 in the morning, and shows what appears to be an Aerostar Tactical UAV flying at low altitude. This is another shot of a Heron TP, taken almost six minutes into a recording captured on June 9, 2010. There is no visible missile mount or payload, but the drone appears to be carrying a modification, which Sweetman called a ventral pannier. Publicly available photos show similar storage compartments under the main hull."}

{"id":359,"title":"Germany seeks clarity on whether spy agency snooped on own diplomat","class":0,"body":" Germany's BND foreign intelligence service spied on a German diplomat, possibly violating the constitution, and on allies including French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, a German radio station reported on Wednesday. Officials firmly declined to comment on the report, but the parliamentary committee that oversees intelligence agencies was due to meet later in the day with the issue to be discussed. The report by the Berlin-based rbb Inforadio was the latest twist in a growing scandal over the activities of Germany's BND stemming from revelations in 2013 by U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden. Without identifying its sources, rbb said the BND had monitored German Hansjoerg Haber, from 2008-2011 head of the EU's observer mission in Georgia and then a senior diplomat in Brussels. He is now head of the EU's mission in Turkey and married to a state secretary in the Interior Ministry. The BND declined to comment. A government spokeswoman, quizzed for about 20 minutes at a regular news conference, declined to comment on the report directly and said the oversight body worked without discussing everything in public. German citizens are protected by the country's constitution and not allowed to be spied on. Privacy is a sensitive issue in Germany due to extensive surveillance by Communist East Germany's Stasi secret police and by the Nazi era Gestapo. Other BND targets have included France's Laurent Fabius and individuals at the International Criminal Court in the Hague, the World Health Organisation, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and firms in the United States, rbb - which stands for Radio Berlin-Brandenburg - reported. Snowden revealed widespread U.S. surveillance in Germany, including bugging Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone. Since then a scandal has erupted over the BND's own activities and how much it helped the NSA. The oversight committee is scrutinising BND activity, especially after revelations this year that it indirectly helped the NSA spy on European firms such as Airbus (AIR.PA). Last month, Justice Minister Heiko Maas called for tighter controls on the BND after reports that its spies had targeted embassies of allied countries without the government's express permission."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":360,"title":" Merkel pledges investigation after claims German intelligence spied on key allies including Britain","class":0,"body":" Angela Merkel’s government has pledged a full investigation into claims German intelligence spied on key allies including Britain. The move comes after a German radio station on Wednesday named Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, among several alleged targets spied on by the BND intelligence service. Mr Fabius is the most senior name to emerge in a long-running spy scandal that is proving embarrassing for Mrs Merkel. The German chancellor reacted angrily two years ago to claims the US National Security Agency (NSA) had listened in to her mobile phone. But her goverment has been accused of hypocrisy after reports surfaced that the BND had spied on some of Germany’s closest allies. The latest allegations come just days after media reports that the BND carried out covert surveillance of European partners including Britain, France, Spain and Italy. Berlin’s RBB-Inforadio on Wednesday broadcast the most detailed list of alleged targets yet to emerge, although it did not identify its sources. The FBI, the International Court of Justice in the Hague and one of Germany’s own most senior diplomats were among those named for the first time. The list also included many European and American companies, including weapons manufacturers such as Lockheed of the US, the radio station claimed. Christiane Wirtz, a spokesman for the German government, promised a full investigation on Wednesday. The duties of the BND do not include political reconnaissance work against partner countries, she told reporters. Gerhard Schindler, the head of the BND, still enjoyed the full confidence of the German government, she said. The allegations that BND spied on Hansjörg Haber, a senior German diplomat, could prove highly damaging domestically. The BND is prohibited from spying on German citizens by the country’s constitution. Mr Haber was head of the EU observer mission to Georgia and then a senior diplomat in Brussels at the time of the alleged surveillance. He is now the head of the EU mission to Turkey, German diplomats are trained to take precautions against spying, but do not expect to be spied on by the BND, Martin Schaefer, a foreign ministry spokesman, told the AFP news agency. A German parliamentary inquiry into spying is currently investigating a 900-page list of the BND’s targets for electronic surveillance. Spying among friends isn’t on, Mrs Merkel famously said at the time of the NSA phone-hacking claims – words that may be now coming back to haunt her."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":361,"title":"Britain's spies are on a PR offensive. We should be more sceptical about them","class":0,"body":" Whatever Guardian journalists may tell you, it's good for Britain that our spies spy. When that newspaper revealed, somewhat hysterically, that GCHQ had snooped on foreign politicians and officials during G20 meetings in London – with fake internet cafes and other black magic – my reaction was for God's sake, don't tell the whole world! In shocked tones, the Guardian said the spying was carried out for the mundane purpose of securing an advantage in meetings.Shocking it may be to some, but this is precisely why we have spy agencies and fund them with £2 billion a year: to give the UK an advantage. It's not mundane – often it's dangerous. But these organisations exist, as MI6 puts it, to promote and defend the national security and economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom. Most of us are relaxed about that. But are we too relaxed? Putting the Edward Snowden-fuelled hysteria to one side, I'd argue that there is something very unhealthy about Britain's attitude towards its spies. This week they are on a public relations offensive in the run-up to the Spending Review and the coming publication of the draft Investigatory Powers Bill. As part of it, a national newspaper has been given exclusive access to GCHQ in Cheltenham. The series of reports make for fascinating reading, since they're packed with telling observations about who works there and the sort of thing they do (though computer screens are quietly switched off as the reporter walks past). It sounds a bit like Google, with GCHQ employees wearing jeans and flip-flops and picking up their skinny lattes every morning from a high-security Starbucks on site. But the whole series has been infused with a certain James Bond mystique. It's even packaged as For your eyes only, and there are the inevitable pictures of characters such as Q from the latest Bond film. It's entertaining reading and priceless PR for the spooks; but is it much more than that? In the same PR push, the BBC recently interviewed two serving MI6 officers. The spies exclusively revealed that they only tell their nearest and dearest about what they do, and batted away polite questions that were never going to delve too deep. Again, entertaining to watch and decent PR, but not much more. For some reason – and this probably does have something to do with James Bond – Britain's spies have survived as the only part of the old-fashioned establishment to which we are still about as deferential as we were 50 or 60 years ago. Those were the days when Kim Philby fobbed off an interviewer with this supercilious line: The efficiency of our security services can only be impaired if their organisations and techniques are discussed in public. (He defected to the Soviet Union a few years later.) In 2015, we still know very little about our spies' techniques and what they do with the extraordinary powers they possess, or really whether those powers are fully justified. Why aren't we more sceptical? Why do we regard them as deserving of our almost unquestioning trust? It doesn't really add up. Even the Snowden revelations did little to dent our faith: only 19 per cent of Britons were concerned in 2013 – at the height of that debacle – that spies had too many surveillance powers. I doubt the other 80-odd per cent could explain what those powers were. And it goes on today. As the publication of the draft Investigatory Powers Bill approaches, it's surely time for a serious debate about what our spies do, how much of our privacy they should be allowed to invade in order to keep us safe, and how much we spend on them. It should concern us all. As the US president Dwight D. Eisenhower warned in 1960, only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can ensure that security and liberty may prosper together.Come to think of it, we could learn something from the sceptical American attitude towards the CIA. Just like the CIA, our spy agencies are highly secretive and powerful government departments, given vast amounts of our money, about which we know very little. Of course they are secret and should stay that way. Let spies spy. But can we drop the old-school deference and the James Bond fantasies and talk about them like grown-ups? They work for us, after all."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":362,"title":" FBI snooped on singer Pete Seeger for 20 years","class":0,"body":" The campaigning singer Pete Seeger, composer of classic American folk tunes including If I Had a Hammer and Where Have All the Flowers Gone?, was spied on by FBI agents for more than two decades because he wrote a protest letter as a young man concerned about plans to deport tens of thousands of Japanese American citizens at the end of the second world war. A vast file on Seeger was released to the independent American news website Mother Jones in response to a request under the freedom of information act. It reveals that the bureau’s spies first took an interest in the singer in 1943. Seeger, a 23-year-old army private at the time, had written denouncing a plan for mass deportation drafted by the California chapter of the American Legion, a veterans’ association. If you bar from citizenship descendants of Japanese, why not descendants of English? After all, we once fought with them too. America is great and strong as she is because we have so far been a haven to all oppressed. I felt sick at heart to read of this matter, he wrote. His angry letter prompted close scrutiny of his political views and associations by the bureau that ran on into the early 1970s. The suspicion was that Seeger, who died in early 2014, was a security risk with close connections to the Communist party. The FBI file on him has nearly 1,800 pages – 90 of them are still withheld for security reasons – and journalist David Corn has unearthed details within it of the elaborate efforts made by government agents to document Seeger’s activities, even back to his school days. An agent sent out to his Connecticut high school found evidence that he had worn bohemian clothes. Another was sent to Harvard, where the singer had spent a year studying, and was told the student’s grades had been fair and that he had been secretary of the student union. Mililtary intelligence also contacted the performer Woody Guthrie, who had played with Seeger in a leftwing group called the Almanac Singers. Seeger, who was later to become one of the earliest backers of Bob Dylan, inviting him to perform at the Newport Folk Festival, had been drafted into the army in 1942 and was trained as an aviation mechanic in Mississippi. His early letter of protest was quickly sent on to the FBI in San Francisco and within weeks military intelligence was investigating him and updating the bureau. As a result, the young mechanic was not sent into action and became increasingly frustrated. He wondered if his engagement to a Japanese-American woman, Toshi Ohta, was a problem. At the time Seeger wrote to his grandmother: It is possible that I am being held here because of my former connections with the Almanac Singers and because of my engagement to a Japanese-American, but I doubt it. I have never tried to hide either fact. Military intelligence also investigated Ohta herself and Seeger’s father, Charles, a noted musicologist. After setting up a fake pretext for an interview with his father, the agent was told the musician had bummed around the country, playing the banjo and singing and was very much interested in the common people. A friendship with the renowned folk singer Lead Belly was also examined. An official report described Lead Belly as a negro murderer who escaped from prison a few years ago. In fact Lead Belly was jailed for killing a relative, but was pardoned in 1925. Guthrie was approached about Seeger in May 1943 and he told the government agent that Seeger could be trusted and should be put to good use by the army. But the agent’s report also noted that Guthrie’s apartment contained a guitar bearing the inscription: This machine kills fascists. This bears out the belief that the Almanac Players were active singing Communist songs and spreading propaganda, concluded the agent. After the probe into Seeger’s background, a report judged that Seeger was potentially subversive and an idealist whose devotion to radical ideologies is such as to make his loyalty to the US under all circumstances questionable. The document was sent to J Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI. The musician eventually joined the army division that entertained the troops. Yet he remained an FBI target after the war. Throughout the 1950s, when Seeger was part of the Weavers folk group, the bureau commissioned hundreds of reports on him, many tracking his musical performances. As the Weavers scored chart hits, Seeger was blacklisted for his suspected Communist party links. In 1955 he was called before the House Committee on un-American Activities and asked if he was a communist. I am not going to answer any questions as to my associations, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs or how I voted in any election or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, Seeger replied. Two years later he was cited for contempt of Congress and then, four years later, found guilty and sentenced to a year in prison. Let free on bail, Seeger’s conviction was overturned a year later. After a 1963 concert in Hawaii, an agent reported that an audience member had heard Seeger sing a song that was low-keyed propaganda to the effect that America is a land of conformity as well as a song from Japan about nuclear bombs. Towards the end of his life Seeger became an environmental crusader who cruised the Hudson river in his sailing boat, Clearwater. Inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972, he was awarded a national medal of arts by President Clinton in 1994 and sang on the steps of the Lincoln memorial at one of President Obama’s inaugural concerts. Seeger did acknowledge he had been in the Communist party in the 1940s and once said he should have left earlier."}

Jónsdóttir, a prominent WikiLeaks supporter, said that she was tipped off to the spying in 2010 by Assange, Iceland's Visir newspaper reported. Having received the tip-off, she warned members of Iceland’s negotiating team not to send emails to each other. The UK authorities had very good access to everything that was going on between members of the team. It is the role of intelligence, for example MI5, to spy on other countries, especially if it concerns their national interests. Their duty was to gather information and intelligence about us, and the duty of the Icelandic government was to do everything to protect us against such espionage, Jónsdóttir told the newspaper. The revelation could reignite tensions between the UK and Iceland, which were stoked in 2008 when the UK government used anti-terrorism legislation to freeze an Icelandic bank’s assets in the UK. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Alastair Darling, seized the funds of Landsbanki’s Internet bank, Icesave, to protect UK depositors’ money after the Icelandic government reacted to Landsbanki’s toxic debts by nationalizing the bank. Last week, Britain got involved in another major spy scandal when it was reported that the UK has been allegedly using its Berlin embassy to spy on the nearby Bundestag, as well as the office of Chancellor Angela Merkel. A new report also revealed that British intelligence agency GCHQ allegedly helped its counterparts in France, Germany, Spain and Sweden develop methods of mass surveillance of internet and phone traffic in the last five years. Documents supplied by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden to the Guardian newspaper show the UK Government Communications Headquarters’ enormous influence throughout Europe. GCHQ is part of the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence-sharing partnership between the US, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  The documents detail how the agency developed and promoted spying processes, built relationships with telecommunication companies and evaded national laws that restrict the surveillance powers of intelligence agencies. Earlier reports revealed by Snowden showed that the US has been monitoring the communications of up to 35 world leaders, including Merkel and Brazilian President. Communications of hundreds of millions of people across the world were also monitored, the leaked documents revealed, including British, French, Spanish and American citizens."}

The documents say the monitoring - conducted while American president Barack Obama and 25 other foreign heads of government met on Canadian soil in June 2010 - was meant to support US policy goals. The G20 summit in Toronto focused on how to rouse a global economic recovery and prevent another financial crisis. One proposal included a global tax on banks, an idea strongly opposed by both Washington and Ottawa, and which was eventually scratched. Canadian spies helped monitor G8 leaders Before the G20 meeting took place, leaders of the G8 countries - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States - met in Huntsville, 220 kilometres north of Toronto. The documents cited by CBC, Canada's public broadcaster, say the spying operation was closely coordinated with the Canadian partner, the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC). By law, the CSEC cannot target anyone in Canada without a warrant, and is prohibited by international agreement from getting the NSA to spy on its behalf in this country. A CSEC spokeswoman says the agency does not target Canadians anywhere or any person in Canada, nor does it ask our international partners to act in a way that circumvents Canadian laws. The official noted that CSEC activities are reviewed by an independent commissioner who for the past 16 years has reported that the agency continues to act lawfully in the conduct of its activities. The CSEC however declined to comment on the operations or capabilities of Canada's allies. Documents previously released by Snowden exposed spying on world leaders. The Guardian newspaper has said Britain snooped on delegates of the Group of 20 during two gatherings in London in 2009, hoping to get an unfair advantage in negotiations or policy debates."}

Hacker attack is a problem faced by the international community. The international community should cooperate with it instead of making speculation and accusations against each other, he said. Singapore-based FireEye in its report released today said the cyber espionage operations dating back to 2005 focused on targets - government and commercial - who hold key political, economic and military information about the region. Such a sustained, planned development effort coupled with the (hacking) group's regional targets and mission, lead us to believe that this activity is state-sponsored - most likely the Chinese government, the cyber security group claimed. The attack is still ongoing, said Bryce Boland, chief technology officer for Asia Pacific at FireEye and co-author of the report. The servers which the attackers used were still operational, and that FireEye continued to see attacks against its customers, he said. China routinely denies accusations about hacker attacks. A similar report in 2011 by McAfee said the Chinese hackers targeted Asian governments and institutions, among other targets."}

These decoy documents contain a bug that can transmit data from the infected computer system back to networks in China. The bug has the ability to hide in the computer and even attack systems not connected to a network. The decoy documents are specially tailored to meet the interests of individuals and organisations that are targeted - these can include government agencies, private industry and media groups.

Prosecutors told Leeds Crown Court that Crosbie snuck into a locker room at a swimming training pool and was caught peeking over the top of cubicles as female Chinese Olympic athletes got changed. When staff at the pool in Leeds, northern England, went to investigate, Crosbie hid in a cubicle and imitated a woman's voice. Judge Peter Collier ordered Crosbie, who has previous convictions for voyeurism, to attend a rehabilitation course for sex offenders. Collier also imposed a 5 year order which legally compels Crosbie to stay away from female changing rooms or bathrooms.

{"id":368,"title":"German investigation says the NSA probably didn't tap Merkel's phone after all","class":0,"body":" Over a year after an unidentified source released a document he said proved the NSA had tapped the personal cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, an investigation by Germany's top prosecutor has found no evidence that the tapping ever occurred. He says he also believes that the document may not even be authentic. The US has long denied that spy agencies snooped on Merkel's cell phone. When the story first broke in October 2013, President Obama personally called Merkel to tell her it wasn't true. It was widely assumed that Obama was lying; it now appears, based on Germany's own investigation, that he may have been telling the truth. It is not clear whether the document came from NSA leaker Edward Snowden. While the story came as Snowden was releasing a number of such documents about NSA programs abroad, the reports have not explicitly credited him with this story. (Some reports have claimed as much, but this is considered to still be disputed.) In some ways, it won't matter if Germany's investigation concludes that the hacking story was false. It's not going to fix the widespread and growing anti-US sentiment among Germans, which was always about much more than Merkel's cell phone. The broader NSA hacking programs in Germany, collecting vast amounts of computer and telephone metadata, are real. And German anti-US sentiment go back years before the NSA scandal began, rooted in Cold War grievances and a sense of being bossed around by the Americans. That is what makes today's announcement by the German prosecutor particularly surprising: bashing the Americans makes for great politics in Germany. At the same time, while it's true that last year's allegations of tapping Merkel's cell phone created a great deal of personal tension and mistrust between Merkel and Obama, that has since healed. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and President Vladimir Putin's other aggressions, have forced Merkel and Obama into a close cooperation that appears to have overcome 2013's tensions. So they had already moved on from last year's awkwardness. The narrative arc of Merkel's cell phone tap, from widely accepted truth to possibly debunked misapprehension, speaks to a larger problem with the recent NSA leaks. The problem was always that the documents were vague and complicated and left a lot of room for interpretation. The documents were complicated and interpreting them was not always easy. The US government, unsurprisingly, refused to help. And Snowden, for all his idealism and ethics, has been an imperfect interpreter of those documents himself, as have his allies. That has meant that sometimes revelations about NSA programs like the tap on Merkel's phone turn out to be wrong, or turn out to be different from how they were first described. The hard truth is that the NSA doesn't print out and distribute company-wide documents that clearly state, with evidence, what it does and doesn't do. Rather, like any sprawling organization, it has a lot of documents that reference existing programs, or describe ambitions for future programs, or proposals, all of which can be vague and indirect. These are the documents Snowden had access to and released to the media. Some of the documents were old; many offered only part of the picture. So Snowden, his allies, and whoever was behind the Merkel story (if it was indeed a separate person) had to do a great deal of interpreting to figure out what, say, an old internal NSA training powerpoint tells them about actual on-the-ground NSA programs. That can be really difficult and it's possible to make honest mistakes. That is why, years from now, many people will continue to believe that Obama personally tapped Merkel's phone, regardless of what evidence emerges. But it's also why another substantial set of people are increasingly rejecting the entirety of the NSA leaks as untrustworthy. But that latter group is wrong as well: for all Snowden's mistakes, the larger story of these leaks, of an NSA run amok, tapping into private data worldwide and with reckless abandon, is absolutely true. Even if the story of Merkel's cell phone, perhaps the most egregious of them all, was not."}

All known copies of the document — and a related paper, on conveying hidden signals — were believed to be destroyed in 1973. But recently, the manuals resurfaced, and have now been published as The Official CIA Manual of Trickery and Deception. Topics include working a clandestine partner, slipping a pill into the drink of the unsuspecting, and surreptitious removal of objects by women. This wasn’t the first time a magician worked for a western government. Harry Houdini snooped on the German and the Russian militiaries for Scotland Yard. English illusionist Jasper Maskelyne is reported to created dummy submarines and fake tanks to distract Rommel’s army during World War II. Some reports even credit him with employing flashing lights to hide the Suez Canal. But Mulholland’s contributions were far different, because they were part of a larger CIA effort, called MK-ULTRA, to control people’s minds. Which lead to the Agency’s infatuation with LSD, as David Hambling recounted here a few weeks ago: In the infamous Operation Midnight Climax, unwitting clients at CIA brothels in New York and San Francisco were slipped LSD and then monitored through one-way mirrors to see how they reacted. They even killed an elephant with LSD. Colleagues were also considered fair game for secret testing, to the point where a memo was issued instructing that the punch bowls at office Christmas parties were not to be spiked. The Boston Globe has put together a great visual summary of some of Mulholland’s best tricks for the CIA: the shoelace pattern that means follow me; the hidden compartment to smuggle in an agent; the best ways to appear dumb and non-threatening.

Chapman, you may recall, was the femme fatale rolled up by the FBI in the early summer of 2010 with nine other illegals – all working undercover for the SVR, Moscow's foreign intelligence service. Their job was to gather U.S. political and economic secrets for the motherland. But unfortunately for them, they had reportedly been betrayed by one of their own. The FBI had secretly snooped on them for years in an operation known as Ghost Stories. This begat the biggest spy swap between Moscow and D.C. since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The U.S. expelled Chapman and company, their covers permanently blown, in exchange for four Russians who had been accused of assisting Western intelligence services. The redheaded ex-spy, born 32 years ago as Anna Vasil'yevna Kushchyenko, has since become a reality TV star (of course). But in her new on-camera devotional to the motherland, she has donned makeup and military fatigues. Chapman fires a rifle, climb on tanks, pumps iron, and marches (and marches and marches) during the nearly 40-minute video. She also trains with a soldier at close quarters, and he teaches her to stab him in the back. (I know, we've all had relationships like this.) Also, she takes an outrageous stab at the fitness of U.S. military: In the American army they fight obesity. The Kantemirovskaya division fighters don't have this problem.

Bush–era interrogation practices exploded into an all-out political war Tuesday when the top lawmaker on intelligence issues publicly accused the spy agency of illegally monitoring Senate computers used in the investigation. Senate Intelligence Committee chair Dianne Feinstein took to the floor Tuesday — reluctantly, she said — because the increasing amount of inaccurate information circulating now cannot be allowed to stand unanswered. Generally friendly with the intelligence community, Feinstein asserted that the CIA may have engaged in unconstitutional and criminal activity by interfering in an investigation of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence — the body tasked with oversight of the intelligence community. The CIA, Feinstein alleged, appeared to have illegally snooped on Senate staff computers, stonewalled when it came to handing over documents and sought to have staff investigated. Her comments were the first public allegations of wrongdoing after congressional officials had anonymously made the accusations in recent news reports. I have grave concerns that the CIA’s search may well have violated the separation-of-powers principles embodied in the United States Constitution, including the speech-and-debate clause, Feinstein said. Besides the constitutional implications, the CIA search may also have violated the Fourth Amendment, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as an Executive Order barring the CIA from conducting domestic surveillance, she said. She specifically slammed the CIA’s acting general counsel, Robert Eatinger, who she said asked the Justice Department to investigate alleged mishandling of classified documents by Senate staff. And she implicitly accused Eatinger of attempting to bully committee staff to protect himself from the investigation. I view the acting general counsel’s referral as a potential effort to intimidate this staff, and I am not taking it lightly, said Feinstein, a California Democrat. I should note that for most, if not all, of the CIA’s detention and interrogation program, the now acting general counsel was a lawyer in the CIA’s counterterrorism center — the unit within which the CIA managed and carried out this program. CIA Director John Brennan quickly fired back at Feinstein. That’s just beyond the scope of reason, Brennan said during an event at the Council on Foreign Relations. An interview with the CIA director responding to Feinstein’s allegations is set to air on MSNBC at noon and in full on NBC News on Tuesday evening. Vermont Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who has worked on intelligence issues throughout his career, called Feinstein’s speech the most important he’s heard on the Senate floor in his 40 years as a member of the body.

Korean spy found dead after allegations intelligence agency snooped on citizens","class":0,"body":" A South Korean intelligence agent has been found dead in an apparent suicide in his car near Seoul. The man left a three-page-long note in which he claimed the country’s spy agency didn’t snoop on its citizens, police said. The body of an employee from South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) was discovered in his car on a mountain road in the city of Yongin, Seoul Capital Area. He reportedly died of carbon monoxide poisoning as officials found a piece of burnt coal inside the car and no signs of external entry, Yongin police said. The 45-year-old man (other sources say he was 46), was identified by his family name Lim by police authorities, Yonhap News Agency said. A family member reported his disappearance after failing to contact the victim. Lim apparently left a three-page-long suicide note in his car, explaining his choice to his family and how exactly NIS implemented its controversial hacking program. He claimed that Seoul really didn’t spy on its citizens. There was no monitoring of people at home, he wrote. In the note he also said that he destroyed surveillance materials relating to North Korea. I deleted information that created misunderstandings about our counter-terrorism and covert operations on North Korea... It was a mistake on my part. But there is nothing to be worried about over any of my actions, he said. Lim apologized to his colleagues and NIS top officials, including agency Director Lee Byoung-ho, saying that excessive zeal for work has created this situation. The alleged spy suicide comes following WikiLeaks revelations, saying that NIS purchased spyware from Hacking Team, an Italian company that sells surveillance tools to governments and law enforcement agencies, back in 2012. The government admitted buying the program, but said that they only used it to spy on North Korea, not on its own citizens. The NIS says the system can hack at least 20 mobile phones simultaneously, which makes it perfect for eavesdropping. Lee Chul-woo, head of a parliamentary intelligence committee, told AFP that Lim was the one who had purchased and run the Italian program. In the meantime, a government insider told Yonhap on condition of anonymity that Lim had mentioned the hacking program in his suicide note. The spy agency has already been notified about what was written in the will, the source added. Established in 1961, the National Intelligence Service has faced several scandals in the past. It was accused of extortion and stock market manipulation, as well as bribing companies, people, and even foreign governments. It was also reportedly eavesdropping illegally on its citizens' conversations."}

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has gone straight to Strasbourg in a bid to get a finding that domestic law is incompatible with provisions in European law which give journalists the right to keep sources confidential from police and others. Its application was filed on Friday and has been accepted by the ECHR, which has indicated in the past it will expedite cases on surveillance through its legal system. The move follows concerns arising out of Edward Snowden’s revelations last year that GCHQ had been secretly gathering intelligence from the country’s largest telecoms companies using a secret computer system code-named Tempora without the knowledge of the companies. Also of concern is a recent revelation, which has alarmed journalists and lawyers, that the police secretly obtained the records of the Sun’s political editor after he refused to reveal the identity of sources in his Plebgate story about an altercation between police and the then Tory whip Andrew Mitchell. Gavin Millar, QC, who is working on the case with the BIJ, said if the application was successful, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa) should be torn up. The whole thing is completely incompatible with European law, we’ve got to go back to the drawing board and find a statutory framework that says only in the most exceptional circumstances would it be okay to collect journalists metadata or content of their phones. Both Tempora and the Metropolitan Police actions against the Sun’s political editor were enabled by Ripa. Part 1, chapter 11 of the Act allows a police officer of superintendent rank or above to seize the phone records of a journalist without the journalist even knowing. Part 1 Chapter 1 of the Act enables GCHQ to collect metadata on the agreement of the Secretary of State. The revelation that the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn’s telephone records were requisitioned from Vodafone and those of the paper’s newsdesk, sent alarm bells throughout the industry with fears that this could have a chilling effect on press freedom with fewer whistleblowers willing to take the risk of phoning a journalists. Millar said he believed the UK authorities were routinely carrying out data collection of journalists and their organisations to build up a picture of their sources and their lines of inquiry. Christopher Hird, chair of the BIJ’s editorial board, said he understood why the government feels the need to have the power to intercept communications. But Hird added that he did not believe there were sufficient safeguards to ensure the protection of journalists’ sources. This, he said, amounted to a restriction on the free press."}

Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who broke the news on the Snowden leaks, says that the idea to exploit the Internet to disseminate points of view friendly to the interests of the Western world and spread false information about targets appears quite often among materials provided by Edward Snowden. In a previous report on the same stack of files, it was revealed that the NSA was instructed to conduct real-time surveillance on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter in order to collect the computer addresses of billions of users. This seems to be a small-time idea compared to the topic of discussion during the 2010 SIGDEV gathering of the members of the Five Eyes, the surveillance alliance formed by the UK, the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. An NSA file from 2010’s SIGDEV meeting focuses on several topics, including propaganda, deception, mass messaging, publishing stories, alias development and psychology. Basically, the document outlines the goal of using online techniques to make something happen in the real or cyber world. Such operations are so important to the intelligence community that they comprise about 5 percent of Operations for the GCHQ. A previous NBC report also indicated that the media could also be used for the agency’s purpose. This was done by picking out journalists that could be used to spread information. In fact, GCHQ operatives would snoop on non-British journalists to get information that could be used to manipulate them to feed the information they wanted. ZunZuneo was a messaging tool created specifically for Cuba by an American state organization, which was supposed to be similar to Twitter but work offline. The app was built and shared without ever mentioning that it was created in the United States. Its purpose was to encourage political change in Cuba after establishing a loyal user base by proposing regular topics, such as football and the weather."}

The investigation showed that Pakistani agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is using a malicious software to infect the smartphones and personal computers of military personnel. The spyware app SmeshAPP, which is easily available on Google playstores, steals all the information stored --including phone calls, text messages and photographs -- and tracks his geo coordinates. The information is stored on a server located in Germany and is hosted by a man identified as Sajid Rana, who is based out of Karachi. The investigation showed, that using this method, Pakistan handlers were even getting crucial information on the movement of troops following the terror attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot in January 2016. The soldiers are lured through Facebook accounts by honeytraps set by ISI. It is learnt that more than 10 such fake FB profiles are are now being used and that dozens of Indian military personnel are now unknowingly in touch with Pakistani handlers. The three services of the armed forces - Army, Navy and Air Force - apart from the Border Security Force (BSF) and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) are so targeted. The handlers identify 'soft'targets before trying to lure them. While field-level officers are the prime targets, even retired personnel are not spared. To investigate the malicious link, CNN-IBN downloaded this app on a mobile phone. The app showed it was developed by a company called smeshapp.com, but the internet address did not yield any result. Further analysis revealed that this app throws up connection to a server named pbxmobiflex.com, which is registered in the name of Sajid Rana.A search for his listed number in the open source directory TrueCaller which fetched the result as Ayan Butt. With technical help we entered the system and it opened the storehouse of individual soldiers personal and professional information. Their entire contact list was seen, SMS records and photogallery could be accessed and calls could be recorded. Also the app could be used to start a recording of audio and video, almost taking over the phones of the service personnel by remote. Security agencies were recently alerted about a twitter handle based in Karachi tweeting pictures of the Pampore anti-terror operations as well as of the BSF personnel killed in an encounter with Maoists in deep forests of Chhattisgarh. The pictures were taken by fellow soldiers, and since no media outlet got access to them , it was clear that the information was being accessed."}

Suleiman was in charge of the Syrian nuclear weapons program which was based on North Korean Plutonium reactor technology and funded by Iran, in violation of Syria’s obligations to the IAEA. That reactor was destroyed by the Israelis during Operation Orchard in 2007,which also demonstrated the ability of the IAF to paralyze the Russian state of the art TOR air defense system by hacking the control radar and planting false signals via the encrypted satellite link. None of the aforementioned details is new, but the goal of the current leak is to warn the Israelis that their encrypted military communications are allegedly monitored by the NSA, which is supposed to hint at the NSA’s ability to thwart a potential Israeli strike on Iran. It’s impossible to know if the NSA really snooped on the Israelis during that 2008 hit operation, but the very use of this Psyop indicates that the CIA plans to protect its new assets in Tehran. This recent leak follows an earlier behind the scenes warning from the Obama regime to Israel and Saudi Arabia, given two years ago, that the US is in control of the regional radar systems and therefore they are advised not to try to bypass those radars on route to Iran. In other words, Iran was already than protected by the American military umbrella. Yesterday’s post has demonstrated the feasibility of the Israeli military option against Iran, so it seems like the greater challenge will be to overcome the American radars and other surveillance systems across the region in order to carry out a strike. With all the media blather and disinformation around the deal, very few noticed the one major shocker hidden within the agreement, which is shown in the screenshot below: the US promises to protect Iran’s nukes from security threats, including sabotage, which can only mean Mossad cloak and dagger ops meant to delay and disrupt Iran’s nuclearization program, be they Stuxnet like computer viruses or mysterious explosions [examples: Exhibit A , Exhibit B]. Rather than restrain and freeze Iran’s nukes, the agreement protects them and nurtures it for possible future use. All of the above is likely to increase the prospects of an Israeli-Sunni preemptive strike once they feel cornered and out of all other options but direct military preemption. Netanyahu and his opposition rival Hertzog have begun quietly forming the foundation for a national unity coalition government, which will enable the political echelon the necessary consensus for carrying out such a military strike when push comes to shove."}

Israeli cyberspies tapped into satellite links carrying the unencrypted exchanges, intel sources told the German paper. Intelligence gleaned was reportedly passed onto Israeli negotiators.

Der Spiegel adds that at least one other intelligence service was also tapping Kerry's communications as he tried to broker an agreement between Israel, the Palestinians and the Arab states. Both the US State Department and Israel declined to comment on the reported spying against Kerry. Spying on foreign leaders is, of course, a core part of the job of signals intelligence agencies worldwide. What the latest incident illustrates is that friendly nations routinely spy on each other, a practice illustrated by American spying on the mobile phone of German chancellor Angela Merkel. Peace negotiations are dynamic and it may be that Kerry was obliged to speak to local middlemen over an insecure line because the timing made arranging a secure conversation impractical. The risks inherent in this approach ought to have come as no surprise to the US Secretary of State because similar allegations even closer to home surfaced only weeks ago. Newsweek magazine reported in May that Israel’s intelligence operations extend to surveillance of senior White House officials. Israeli government ministers angrily denounced the report as an attempt to harm US-Israeli relations. Despite its close relationship with the United States, Israel was named as a top espionage threat against the US government in leaked documents obtained by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The documents, dating back to 2007, accuse Israel of trying to manipulate US public opinion (alongside the likes of China, Russia, Cuba, Iran, France and Venezuela) and label it a threat to US critical information systems (alongside India, North Korea and Cuba), Newsweek reports. The latest Snowden leaks revealed the NSA maintained close links with Israel, sending the country raw material, as well as daily analytic and technical correspondence that provided data used to monitor and target Palestinians."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":379,"title":" Chinese hackers steal U.S. weapons systems designs, report says","class":0,"body":" This image provided by the US Navy shows a modified Standard Missile 2 interceptor is launched in 2008 from the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Erie during a test. A new report says Chinese hackers have stolen designs for several U.S. weapons systems. BY TERRIL YUE JONES, BILL TROTT AND ROB TAYLOR, REUTERS Chinese hackers have gained access to designs of more than two dozen major U.S. weapons systems, a U.S. report said on Monday, as Australian media said Chinese hackers had stolen the blueprints for Australia's new spy headquarters. Citing a report prepared for the Defense Department by the Defense Science Board, the Washington Post said the compromised U.S. designs included those for combat aircraft and ships, as well as missile defenses vital for Europe, Asia and the Gulf. Among the weapons listed in the report were the advanced Patriot missile system, the Navy's Aegis ballistic missile defense systems, the F/A-18 fighter jet, the V-22 Osprey, the Black Hawk helicopter and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The report did not specify the extent or time of the cyber-thefts or indicate if they involved computer networks of the U.S. government, contractors or subcontractors. But the espionage would give China knowledge that could be exploited in a conflict, such as the ability to knock out communications and corrupting data, the Post said. It also could speed China's development of its defense technology. In a report to Congress this month, the Pentagon said China was using espionage to modernize its military and its hacking was a serious concern. It said the U.S. government had been the target of hacking that appeared to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military. China dismissed the report as groundless. China also dismissed as without foundation a February report by the U.S. computer security company Mandiant, which said a secretive Chinese military unit was probably behind a series of hacking attacks targeting the United States that had stolen data from 100 companies. In Australia, a news report said hackers linked to China stole the floor plans of a A$630 million headquarters for the Australia Security Intelligence Organization, the country's domestic spy agency. The attack through the computers of a construction contractor exposed not only building layouts, but also the location of communication and computer networks, it said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei, asked about the Australian report, said China disapproved of hacking. China pays high attention to the cyber security issue and is firmly opposed to all forms of hacker attacks, Hong said at a daily briefing. Since it is very difficult to find out the origin of hacker attacks, it is very difficult to find out who carried out such attacks, Hong said. I don't know what the evidence is for media to make such kinds of reports. Repeating China's position that every country was susceptible to cyber attacks, Hong said nations should make joint efforts towards a secure and open Internet. Australia security analyst Des Ball told the ABC that such information about the yet to be completed spy headquarters made it vulnerable to cyber attacks. You can start constructing your own wiring diagrams, where the linkages are through telephone connections, through wi-fi connections, which rooms are likely to be the ones that are used for sensitive conversations, how to surreptitiously put devices into the walls of those rooms, said Ball. The building is designed to be part of an electronic intelligence gathering network that includes the United States and Britain. Its construction has been plagued by delays and cost over-runs with some builders blaming late design changes on cyber attacks. The ABC report said the Chinese hacking was part of a wave of cyber attacks against business and military targets in the close U.S. ally. It said the hackers also stole confidential information from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which houses the overseas spy agency, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, and had targeted companies, including steel-manufacturer Bluescope Steel, and military and civilian communications manufacturer Codan Ltd. The influential Greens party said the hacking was a security blunder of epic proportions and called for an inquiry, but the government did not confirm the breach. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the reports were inaccurate, but declined to say how. Despite being one of Beijing's major trade partners, Australia is seen by China as the southern fulcrum of a U.S. military pivot to the Asia-Pacific. In 2011, it agreed to host thousands of U.S. Marines in near-permanent rotation. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei was last year barred from bidding for construction contracts on a new Australian high-speed broadband network amid fears of cyber espionage. The Reserve Bank of Australia said in March that it had been targeted by cyber attacks, but no data had been lost or systems compromised amid reports the hackers had tried to access intelligence negotiations among a Group of 20 wealthy nations."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":380,"title":" Get Ready, Iran: U.S. Air Force Adds Squadrons for Nuke Spying","class":0,"body":" he are big changes afoot for the U.S. Air Force’s nuclear intelligence force. Hidden away at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida, the secretive Air Force Technical Applications Center now has five new squadrons. Originally created in 1959 as the even more obscure-sounding 1035th Field Activities Group, AFTAC keeps an eye out for atomic tests, makes sure other countries are playing by the rules of nuclear treaties and monitors foreign long-range missile and space launches. In 2014, the flying branch decided to turn the organization into the equivalent of a wing-type unit … and this means new squadrons. An official Air Force news article named the squadrons and described their missions: Technical Surveillance Squadron (TESS) – this squadron, now commanded by Lt. Col. Ehren Carl, provides the nation with persistent surveillance to monitor treaty compliance through AFTAC’s 24/7 Operations Center and the U.S. Atomic Energy Detection System to detect, identify and locate nuclear explosions underground, underwater, in the atmosphere or in space. Technical Operations Squadron (TOPS) – this squadron, led by Lt. Col. Robert Light, conducts Olympic Titan (mobile maritime platform foreign missile and space activity operations) and worldwide reconnaissance missions via technical sensors radar systems and aerial sampling operations to provide national authorities quality technical measurements to monitor treaty compliance involving weapons of mass destruction that threaten national security. Technical Support Squadron (TSUS) – this squadron, under the command of Lt. Col. Dennis Uyechi, provides a broad range of world-class operations support to AFTAC, including intelligence support, training, standardization and evaluation, command staff and operations support to 17 worldwide locations employing more than 1,000 personnel executing the center’s nuclear treaty monitoring mission. Technical Sustainment Squadron (TSMS) – this squadron, with Maj. Patrick Carpizo at the helm, empowers AFTAC with quality sustainment of the U.S. Atomic Energy Detection System and innovative global logistics and maintenance support to the Department of Defense’s sole nuclear treaty monitoring mission. Cyber Capabilities Squadron (CYCS) – this squadron, commanded by Lt. Col. Brian Hippel, provides AFTAC with decisive and assured cyberspace capabilities through innovative and robust global network architecture, data management, systems engineering and integrations services with unrivaled expertise and commitment. The TESS’ is no doubt focused on North Korea. Since 2009, the reclusive regime has tested at least two nuclear weapons in underground sites. Iran is another possible target for the squadron’s monitoring gear. TOPS will most likely continue spying on friends and allies alike through its Olympic Titan missions — one of three specialized global intelligence programs run by U.S. Strategic Command. The squadron has snooped on Chinese, Indian, Iranian, Israeli and Syrian ballistic missile and space-bound rocket launches for at least the last eight years, according to Air Force histories War Is Boring obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The U.S. Navy and Air Force work together to keep track of these launches using a number of largely unknown spy ships such as the USNS Howard O. Lorenzen – a.k.a. Cobra King – and USNS Invincible, or Gray Star. The quasi-civilian Military Sealift Command officially refers to these vessels as missile range instrumentation ships. On top of this, TOPS could coordinate with RC-135 and WC-135 reconnaissance planes, which hoover up information and air samples after suspected atomic explosions. The Air Force’s 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska owns the entire fleet of these unique, airliner-sized spy planes. AFTAC is the sole organization in the federal government whose mission is to detect and report technical data from foreign nuclear explosions, according to its official fact sheet. As a result, TSUS will be in charge of making sure signatories to the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty keep up their end of these bargains. In 1963, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all agreed to monitor nuclear tests in the skies, in space and underwater. More than a decade later, Washington and Moscow decided to stop testing nuclear weapons with yields greater than 150 kilotons underground. The Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons – more commonly known as the NPT – gave nations the right to experiment with atomic blasts for civilian purposes … and created a loophole in test bans. Since the end of World War II, both Washington and Moscow toyed with the idea of carving out roadways through mountain passes or sealing up oil spills with nuclear detonations, among other nominally peaceful ideas. The United States and Russia have not tested nuclear weapons since the early 1990s. But with Washington and Tehran beginning to implement a landmark nuclear deal, and an ever-obstinate Pyongyang among other concerns, AFTACs new squadrons will be plenty busy."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":381,"title":" Germany 'accidentally' snooped on John Kerry and Hillary Clinton","class":0,"body":" Calls made by US secretary of state John Kerry and his predecessor Hillary Clinton were accidentally intercepted by German intelligence agencies, Der Spiegel reports. The Bundesnachrichtdienst (BND), the German intelligence service, snooped on a satellite phone conversation that Kerry made in 2013, a year after it intercepted a call between Clinton and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan in 2012. None of the three were targets of surveillance but their conversations were intercepted anyway: in Clinton's case this was because the call she was making was on the same frequency as a terror suspect (report in German here). Turkey – a fellow member of NATO – was named as a target for German intelligence gathering in a leaked BND document dating from 2009 and obtained by Der Spiegel (report in German here). A BND spokeswoman told Reuters that Germany was not tapping the phones of allied countries. She also sought to downplay suggestions that US politicians had become the target of surveillance as a reprisal for the much publicised snooping on German chancellor Angela Merkel's phone by the NSA and others. Any accidental recordings are deleted immediately, she said. ‪Turkey‬'s foreign ministry has reportedly summoned the German ambassador for a meeting without coffee, while the US has kept a diplomatic silence over the latest snooping revelations. Der Spiegel previously reported that Kerry's phone calls were intercepted by Israeli signals intelligence spies during failed Middle East peace talks last year. Intelligence gleaned was passed onto Israeli negotiators, giving them an advantage of knowing more about the negotiating position of other parties during the ultimately unsuccessful talks. Der Spiegel said at least one other intelligence service was also tapping Kerry's communications as he tried to broker an agreement between Israel, the Palestinians and the Arab states. Its latest reports confirm rumours that the other spy in the room was Germany. Kerry was said to have used both encrypted and open phone lines during his diplomatic efforts with open lines being brought into play when the senior US politician needed to talk to third-party deal brokers. Spying on foreign leaders is, of course, a core part of the job of signals intelligence agencies worldwide. Revelations about spying by the Germans weaken its moral authority in complaining about US snooping, which was perhaps the aim of whoever leaked these German secrets to Der Spiegel. German-US relations, already under a bit of a cloud because of the Merkel spying allegations, were further inflamed last month when a BND worker was cuffed over allegations he spied for the Americans. The 31-year-old allegedly supplied the NSA with information on a German Parliamentary inquiry into spying by the NSA, among other matters. The story goes that evidence of his alleged malfeasance only emerged after German counter-intelligence agents got wind of the technical support staffer's offer to work for the Russians." }

{"id":382,"title":" NSA monitored calls of 35 world leaders after US official handed over contacts","class":0,"body":" The National Security Agency monitored the phone conversations of 35 world leaders after being given the numbers by an official in another US government department, according to a classified document provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The confidential memo reveals that the NSA encourages senior officials in its customer departments, such as the White House, State and the Pentagon, to share their Rolodexes so the agency can add the phone numbers of leading foreign politicians to their surveillance systems. The document notes that one unnamed US official handed over 200 numbers, including those of the 35 world leaders, none of whom is named. These were immediately tasked for monitoring by the NSA. The revelation is set to add to mounting diplomatic tensions between the US and its allies, after the German chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday accused the US of tapping her mobile phone. After Merkel's allegations became public, White House press secretary Jay Carney issued a statement that said the US is not monitoring and will not monitor the German chancellor's communications. But that failed to quell the row, as officials in Berlin quickly pointed out that the US did not deny monitoring the phone in the past. Arriving in Brussels for an EU summit Merkel accused the US of a breach of trust. We need to have trust in our allies and partners, and this must now be established once again. I repeat that spying among friends is not at all acceptable against anyone, and that goes for every citizen in Germany. The NSA memo obtained by the Guardian suggests that such surveillance was not isolated, as the agency routinely monitors the phone numbers of world leaders – and even asks for the assistance of other US officials to do so. The memo, dated October 2006 and which was issued to staff in the agency's Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID), was titled Customers Can Help SID Obtain Targetable Phone Numbers. It begins by setting out an example of how US officials who mixed with world leaders and politicians could help agency surveillance. In one recent case, the memo notes, a US official provided NSA with 200 phone numbers to 35 world leaders … Despite the fact that the majority is probably available via open source, the PCs [intelligence production centers] have noted 43 previously unknown phone numbers. These numbers plus several others have been tasked. The document continues by saying the new phone numbers had helped the agency discover still more new contact details to add to their monitoring: These numbers have provided lead information to other numbers that have subsequently been tasked. But the memo acknowledges that eavesdropping on the numbers had produced little reportable intelligence. In the wake of the Merkel row, the US is facing growing international criticism that any intelligence benefit from spying on friendly governments is far outweighed by the potential diplomatic damage. The memo then asks analysts to think about any customers they currently serve who might similarly be happy to turn over details of their contacts. This success leads S2 [signals intelligence] to wonder if there are NSA liaisons whose supported customers may be willing to share their 'Rolodexes' or phone lists with NSA as potential sources of intelligence, it states. S2 welcomes such information! The document suggests that sometimes these offers come unsolicited, with US customers spontaneously offering the agency access to their overseas networks. From time to time, SID is offered access to the personal contact databases of US officials, it states. Such 'Rolodexes' may contain contact information for foreign political or military leaders, to include direct line, fax, residence and cellular numbers. The Guardian approached the Obama administration for comment on the latest document. Officials declined to respond directly to the new material, instead referring to comments delivered by Carney at Thursday's daily briefing. Carney told reporters: The [NSA] revelations have clearly caused tension in our relationships with some countries, and we are dealing with that through diplomatic channels. These are very important relations both economically and for our security, and we will work to maintain the closest possible ties. The public accusation of spying on Merkel adds to mounting political tensions in Europe about the scope of US surveillance on the governments of its allies, after a cascade of backlashes and apologetic phone calls with leaders across the continent over the course of the week. Asked on Wednesday evening if the NSA had in the past tracked the German chancellor's communications, Caitlin Hayden, the White House's National Security Council spokeswoman, said: The United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of Chancellor Merkel. Beyond that, I'm not in a position to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity. At the daily briefing on Thursday, Carney again refused to answer repeated questions about whether the US had spied on Merkel's calls in the past. The NSA memo seen by the Guardian was written halfway through George W Bush's second term, when Condoleezza Rice was secretary of state and Donald Rumsfeld was in his final months as defence secretary. Merkel, who, according to Reuters, suspected the surveillance after finding her mobile phone number written on a US document, is said to have called for US surveillance to be placed on a new legal footing during a phone call to President Obama. The [German] federal government, as a close ally and partner of the US, expects in the future a clear contractual basis for the activity of the services and their co-operation, she told the president. The leader of Germany's Green party, Katrin Goring-Eckhart, called the alleged spying an unprecedented breach of trust between the two countries. Earlier in the week, Obama called the French president François Hollande in response to reports in Le Monde that the NSA accessed more than 70m phone records of French citizens in a single 30-day period, while earlier reports in Der Spiegel uncovered NSA activity against the offices and communications of senior officials of the European Union. The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, this week backed proposals that could require US tech companies to seek permission before handing over EU citizens' data to US intelligence agencies, while the European parliament voted in favour of suspending a transatlantic bank data sharing agreement after Der Spiegel revealed the agency was monitoring the international bank transfer system Swift."}

The social networking giant has introduced a new feature that will alert users if their account is being snooped on by the US’ National Security Agency or such government-sponsored agents. In a post, Alex Stamos, chief security officer at Facebook, notes that users’ account privacy is important to the company and thus, it continuously monitors malevolent activities and provides a multitude of options to safeguard user accounts. To address this, users will be shown an additional warning if Facebook has a strong suspicion that an attack could be government-sponsored. By showing these warnings, Stamos explains that they do not indicate any compromise of the Facebook platform or system. It may indicate that the user’s computer or mobile device has been infected with malware and miscreants might be taking advantage of it. The notification is to help users rebuild or replace affected systems and take necessary steps to protect their privacy. It will also prompt an option to customise Login Approvals so that unauthorised access to the account is thwarted. Facebook further explains that it will not attribute certain attacks to suspected attackers to protect the integrity of its methods and processes unless circumstances require. This comes amidst the growing concern and debate around Internet privacy of citizens following the mega trove of classified information leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden about US and UK government’s snooping program on unsuspecting citizens in a bid to thwart global terrorism."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":384,"title":" DID YOU KNOW?: Two Secretive Israeli Companies Reportedly Bugged The US Telecommunications Grid For The NSA","class":0,"body":" The newest information regarding the NSA domestic spying scandal raises an important question: If America's tech giants didn't 'participate knowingly' in the dragnet of electronic communication, how does the NSA get all of their data? One theory: the NSA hired two secretive Israeli companies to wiretap the U.S. telecommunications network. In April 2012 Wired's James Bamford — author of the book The Shadow Factory: The NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America — reported that two companies with extensive links to Israel's intelligence service provided hardware and software to wiretap the U.S. telecommunications network for the National Security Agency (NSA). By doing so, this would imply, companies like Facebook and Google don't have to explicitly provide the NSA with access to their servers because major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as AT&T and Verizon already allows the U.S. signals intelligence agency to eavesdrop on all of their data anyway. From Bamford (emphasis ours): According to a former Verizon employee briefed on the program, Verint, owned by Comverse Technology, taps the communication lines at Verizon... At AT&T the wiretapping rooms are powered by software and hardware from Narus, now owned by Boeing, a discovery made by AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein in 2004. Klein, an engineer, discovered the secret room at AT&T central office in San Francisco, through which the NSA actively *vacuumed up Internet and phone-call data from ordinary Americans with the cooperation of AT&T through the wiretapping rooms, emphasizing that much of the data sent through AT&T to the NSA was purely domestic. NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake corroborated Klein's assertions, testifying that while the NSA is using Israeli-made NARUS hardware to seize and save all personal electronic communications. Both Verint and Narus were founded in Israel in the 1990s. Both provide monitoring and intercept capabilities to service providers and government organizations, promoting claims that their equipment can access and retain large amounts of information on a vast number of targets. From Robert Poe of Wired: Narus' product, the Semantic Traffic Analyzer, is a software application that runs on standard IBM or Dell servers using the Linux operating system. It's renowned within certain circles for its ability to inspect traffic in real time on high-bandwidth pipes, identifying packets of interest as they race by at up to 10 Gbps. *Anything that comes through (an internet protocol network), we can record, Steve Bannerman, marketing vice president of Narus, a Mountain View, California company, said. We can reconstruct all of their e-mails along with attachments, see what web pages they clicked on, we can reconstruct their (voice over internet protocol) calls. With a telecom wiretap the NSA only needs companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple to passively participate while the agency to intercepts, stores, and analyzes their communication data. The indirect nature of the agreement would provide tech giants with plausible deniability. And having a foreign contractor bug the telecom grid would mean that the NSA gained access to most of the domestic traffic flowing through the U.S. without technically doing it themselves. This would provide the NSA, whose official mission is to spy on foreign communications, with plausible deniability regarding domestic snooping. Meanwhile projects like the agency's $2 billion data center in Bluffdale, Utah — which can collect and analyze yottobytes of information— to sift through domestic internet traffic. In 2007 a former commander of the highly secret Unit 8200 (i.e. Israel’s NSA) told Forbes that the technology of Comverse (i.e. the company that owns Verint) is based on Unit 8200 technology. One of the founders of Verint, Jacob Kobi Alexander, is a former Israeli intelligence officer. A co-founder and former chairmen of Narus, Ori Cohen, told Fortune in 2001 that his partners have done technology work for Israeli intelligence. In 2011 another former chief of Unit 8200 acknowledged to the Israeli paper Haartez that high-tech firms around the world employ both Unit 8200 equipment and its veteran personnel. From Bamford Wired (emphasis ours): Cautious estimates indicate that in the past few years... Unit 8200 veterans have set up some 30 to 40 high-tech companies, including 5 to 10 that were floated on Wall Street. Referred to only as Brigadier General B, he added, This correlation between serving in the intelligence Unit 8200 and starting successful high-tech companies is not coincidental: Many of the technologies in use around the world and developed in Israel were originally military technologies and were developed and improved by Unit veterans. The NSA began eavesdropping on the international communications of Americans after President Bush secretly authorized the practice in 2002 — without the court-approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying — to search for evidence of terrorist activity. The newest revelations confirm that the practices employed during the secret program, code-named Stellar Wind, hasn't stopped under President Obama. From the Pulitzer-Prize winning 2005 story by Eric Lichtblau and James Risen of the New York Times: As part of the program approved by President Bush for domestic surveillance without warrants, the N.S.A. has gained the cooperation of American telecommunications companies to obtain backdoor access to streams of domestic and international communications, the officials said."}

House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz and subcommittee Chairman Ron DeSantis wrote a letter to NSA Director Michael Rogers raising questions concerning the processes NSA employees follow in determining whether intercepted communications involved members of Congress. The Wall Street Journal also said according to current and former US officials, NSA targeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some other Israeli officials while they started a campaign against the Iran nuclear deal in Capitol Hill, Washington DC. The Wall Street Journal also reported that NSA wiretapped Israeli officials and spied on the details about their lobbying efforts, including their conversations with lawmakers and Jewish-American groups. The Republicans Chaffetz and DeSantis asked Rogers to provide information on how the NSA determined lawmakers’ communications have been tapped and how much leeway agency employees have in passing on the intercepts to other US agencies and the White House. The committee also requested a briefing by the NSA. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a California Republican, announced on Wednesday his panel will ask for more information from the officials who are investigating the allegations. The Committee has requested additional information from the IC to determine which, if any, of these allegations are true, and whether the IC followed all applicable laws, rules, and procedures, Nunes said in a statement.

Israeli intelligence agencies intercepted Kerry's phone calls and listened to his conversations via satellite while he was attempting to reach a peace deal between Israel and Palestine earlier this year, German news magazine Der Spiegel reported. The Israeli government then used the information obtained from Kerry's conversations in its negotiations. The US-led peace talks fell apart at the end of April. The US State Department and Israel both declined Der Spiegel's request for comment on the matter. Kerry used encrypted phone lines, but also discussed issues with Israel, Palestine and the Arab states on normal phones, allowing Israeli spies to intercept his unsecured conversations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (L) meets with US Secretary of State John Kerry during a meeting in Jerusalem.(Reuters) In addition to Israel's intelligence agencies, at least one other spy service monitored Kerry's calls, Der Spiegel reported. The revelations could further fracture US-Israeli relations, which are already strained following Israel's military offensive on the Gaza Strip, which has killed almost 200 Palestinians since the latest ceasefire broke down. UK Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond said that the conflict in Gaza has become intolerable. Some 1,740 Palestinians have died since Israel launched its militaryincursion Operation Protective Edge at the start of July. An estimated 65 Israelis have been killed.On Sunday, it was reported that at least 10 people and a further 30 were injured when a school run by the United Nations in Rafah, southern Gaza was hit by an Israeli airstrike. Robert Turner, director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, said the attack could not have been an accident because the agency informs the Israeli Defence Force of all its sites and shelters daily.

According to this information, German intelligence wiretapped conversations, including Catherine Ashton during a period when she served as Supreme representative of the European Union on foreign policy. In addition, BND tried to listen to the personal phone of US Secretary of state John Kerry, but in this case there was a curious error: the phone number entered in the hearing program, instead of the code, the U.S. code was amended to one of the African States. However, the agents of German special services listened to negotiations by John Kerry on other phone lines. In 2014, Der Spiegel reported that German intelligence listened to one conversation of U.S. Secretary of state John Kerry, which was conducted by mobile phone. Then it was argued that the recording of a conversation Kerry was random, as U.S. Secretary of state had not been monitoring German intelligence. Apparently, the conversation concerned the middle East. Then it was reported that since 2009, the BND conducts intelligence activities against Turkey, which is a member of NATO. Perhaps the conversation Kerry was listened to as part of this activity. In addition, it was alleged that in 2012 BND listened to the conversation of the American Secretary of state Hillary Clinton and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":389,"title":" UK spying on Germany’s major data cable to US triggers media storm","class":0,"body":" A wave of outraged comments have swept the German media after it was revealed Monday that British secret Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) wiretapped the dataflow of Germany’s major transatlantic cable. The northern German public broadcaster NDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported late on Monday that Germany’s external intelligence service BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst) has been in the dark about GCHQ wiretapping Transatlantic Telephone Cable No. 14 (TAT-14) connecting Germany with the US via UK, in the framework of its Tempora data collection project. The TAT-14 fiber optic cables entered service in 2001. It is operated by private consortium German Telekom and used by around 50 international communication companies for phone calls, internet connection, data transfer etc. Countries like Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the UK itself also use this cable for internet connection to North America. The capacity of the 15,000km TAT-14 is enormous; it transfers hundreds of gigabytes of data per second in both directions. The report claimed British GCHQ has already had access to 21,600 terabytes of private and business German data transferred through the cable. The initial reaction from official Berlin concerning Edward Snowden’s revelations about British intelligence straddling Germany’s major fiber optics cables without Berlin’s knowledge was rather moderate. Senior German Interior Ministry official Ulrich Weinbrenner admitted to the Bundestag committee that it was known in general form that foreign tapping programs - like American PRISM and British Tempora - existed. Having met American President Barack Obama last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel cautiously commented that collecting information needs ‘proportionality’ and that the free democratic order is based on people feeling safe. However, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert announced that Berlin wanted explanations from NATO allies on what legal basis and to which extent surveillance had been conducted. The head of the Free Democratic Party parliamentary group, Rainer Brüderle, demanded an investigation. A comprehensive monitoring of citizens in the network cannot and will not be accepted , he told Passau Neue Presse. We need to step back here and say clearly: mass surveillance is not what we want, said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German Green member in charge of a planned overhaul of the European Union's data protection laws. We urge the Federal Government and the EU Commission to  initiate an infringement proceedings against the UK government, which would have to deal with the matter, Albrecht said to Berliner Zeitung. The Federal Government and the Commission must take the issue of protecting fundamental rights seriously, the rapporteur added in the Judiciary Committee. Albrecht’ thoughts were echoed by CSU MEP Manfred Weber who told Berliner Zeitung that If European law has been broken, such as in relation to the retention, the Commission must act. The harshest comment came from German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, who dubbed the total eavesdropping from a NATO ally a Hollywood nightmare. Federal Commissioner for Data Protection Peter Schaar called on the federal government to proceed on an international level against data espionage from abroad. The federal government must insist that our emails will not be penetrated by foreign intelligence services, he demanded according to Bild newspaper. The methods used by the American NSA and British GCHQ agencies are secret, but lawful and subject to proper UK statutory controls and safeguards, stated UK Foreign Secretary William Hague. But such statements have produced little effect on the public or within expert communities. How much and which data of German citizens and companies had been secretly accessed by the Anglo-American intelligence services NSA and GCHQ, for example by tapping glass fiber cables? questioned Greens party parliamentarian Hans-Christian Ströbele, as quoted by Deutsche Welle (DW). The shoulder-shrugging explanation by Washington and London that they have operated within the law is absurd. They are not our laws. We didn't make them. We shouldn't be subject to them, Spiegel online columnist Jakob Augstein. We have not asked the NSA and GCHQ to ‘protect’ us, he said. Gisela Pilz, a data protection expert with the parliamentary group of the liberal FDP, the junior partner in the governing coalition, agrees. We observe with a great deal of concern and dismay the amount of data that has been collected and stored, she told DW. Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government was caught in the crossfire of criticism for not ensuring national digital security. It is the responsibility of the German government to see that foreign agencies no longer process the data of German citizens and companies, Augstein stressed, because a government that cannot make that assurance is failing in one of its fundamental obligations: to protect its own citizens from the grasp of foreign powers, he concluded. Germans should closely observe how Angela Merkel now behaves. The head of the Bundestag's intelligence supervisory committee, opposition Social Democrats deputy Thomas Oppermann, called to speed up the elaboration of data privacy legislation currently being drafted in the EU."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":390,"title":" Germans not amused by Victoria Nuland gaffe","class":0,"body":" BERLIN — Germans were already smarting from revelations that U.S. intelligence listened in on the phone conversations of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Then came Nulandgate. On Thursday, a video was posted on YouTube in which Victoria Nuland, the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, disparagingly dismissed European Union efforts to mediate the ongoing crisis in the Ukraine by bluntly saying, F--- the E.U. On Friday, Merkel, through press attache Christiane Wirtz, described the gaffe as absolutely unacceptable, and defended the efforts of Catherine Ashton, the E.U.’s foreign policy chief. The chancellor finds these remarks absolutely unacceptable and wants to emphasize that Mrs. Ashton is doing an outstanding job, Wirtz said. Still freshly furious over the phone-tapping scandals, Germans took to Twitter and other social media in a litany of bitter comments. Since we know now that the leadership circles in the #USA don’t give a s--- about Europe, we should just stop the Free Trade Agreement, came one tweet from @kl1lercher, referring to ongoing negotiations to forge a transatlantic free-trade deal. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said at a media briefing Friday that this just goes to show once more that wiretapping is stupid. Some German news media, however, were quick to warn against overreaction. Der Spiegel online published an opinion column titled Relax, Europe. Europe should simply laugh about the American F-word, the outlet said in an editorial that also offered a critique of the E.U.’s diplomatic efforts in the Ukraine. Some humor would do no harm to the transatlantic relationship at the moment. In Brussels, E.U. officials remained publicly mum. Though the story played big across the continent, the official response beyond Germany appeared relatively muted. But the Germans were not the only ones smarting. Reactions among Austrian members of the European Parliament ranged from outrage to schadenfreude. Victoria Nuland must step down after these remarks, otherwise there has to be a suspension of negotiations about the E.U.-U.S. free-trade agreement, Jörg Leichtfried, leader of the Austrian Social Democratic delegation in the European Parliament, told the Austrian press agency APA, according to the daily Die Presse. Nuland quickly apologized for the comments, with the United States pointing the finger Thursday at the Russians for recording and posting her private conversations with U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey R. Pyatt. We have a long and enduring relationship with Germany, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in Washington. She noted that Secretary of State John F. Kerry was in Germany last week. We expect we’ll be back to business as usual with them as well, Psaki said. Nevertheless, analysts said the unscripted moment served to underscore a serious point: the increasingly strained nature of the U.S. relationship with continental Europe — and, first and foremost, with Germany. In the aftermath of the exposure by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden of U.S. intelligence-gathering efforts in the region, distrust of the American agenda in Germany has jumped appreciably. Experts say the image of the United States has suffered deeply, with the Nuland gaffe reinforcing perceptions of American heavy-handedness at a highly sensitive time. This week, for instance, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper published fresh allegations that the United States had wiretapped former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder. In response, Schröder gave an interview to the Bild newspaper in which he said, The U.S. has no respect for a loyal ally and for the sovereignty of our country. Olaf Boehnke, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the gaffe could not have come at a worse time. To some extent, German officials — particularly Merkel — have sought to put the wiretapping scandal behind them, pragmatically attempting to move forward and mend the transatlantic relationship. Nuland’s comments, he said, had just made that effort more difficult, particularly with the increasingly skeptical German public. It was really the worst thing that could happen; Germans will be going home tonight to discuss this at dinner, Boehnke said. It fits into a broader picture that German people have of the U.S. betraying the trust in them."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":391,"title":" Turkey confronts alleged spying by allies","class":0,"body":" It all started when Edward Snowden started leaking classified information in June 2013 from the National Security Agency (NSA), revealing that the US surveillance scheme was not only targeting the bad guys. He leaked in October 2013 that the cell phone of Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel was tapped. The German government sharply reacted. Merkel said repeatedly that US espionage against a close ally was unacceptable, but that there was no alternative to close ties with Washington. Yet, Germany expelled the CIA Berlin bureau chief without publicizing his name, making a point that they were not going to put up with everything that the United States does. With all that tough posturing, though, German weekly Der Spiegel reported Aug. 18 that Germany's foreign intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), had inadvertently spied on US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, and had also deliberately targeted Turkey since 2009. Turkey is one of the BND focuses included in the BND order profile, making the country an official target for the foreign intelligence agency’s espionage efforts, Der Spiegel wrote, stressing that the German government, too, has targeted a NATO ally in its espionage. On Aug. 31, Der Spiegel took the news to new heights by reporting that spying against Turkey was not limited to Germany. Documents from the archive of whistleblower Edward Snowden reveal wide-scale spying against Turkey by America’s NSA and Britain’s GCHQ [Government Communications Headquarters], Der Spiegel wrote, noting that the United States significantly helped Turkey in its fight against Kurdish separatists. Although Turkey’s reaction to Germany was limited, there was no split voice in the government response. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the news that the US and British intelligence services spied against Turkey. Let me say this very openly. There is no such thing for countries with strong intelligence capability not to wiretap other countries. We should all know about this. All of them are doing it, Erdogan said Sept. 1 at a news conference before departing for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for his first foreign travel as president. Therefore, what is important is how they do what they do, and how they make that knowledge public. The NATO summit and the UN General Assembly [annual] meetings are coming up. We will talk about these issues during our meetings with the leaders. I believe they will probably bring a tighter control to the leakage of such information threatening world peace. Turkey’s Foreign Ministry, however, on Sept. 1 released a written statement with a different tone: In case these allegations are confirmed, it is clear that such activities can in no way be acceptable and that it has no place in the relationship of our two countries based on friendship and alliance. We are expecting that the United States investigates these allegations, and if it finds truth into these allegations, that it immediately stops these activities against our state institutions and foreign representations, adding that the US charge d'affaires in Ankara, Jess Baily, was called to the Foreign Ministry on Sept.1 to receive this notification in person. Retired intelligence officers talking to Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity stress two things based on the Turkish government’s reaction: After Erdogan’s rationalization of espionage against Turkey, it won’t be possible to ask these countries to withdraw their spy chiefs from this country. According to these intelligence officers, the issue was not that Erdogan is wrong in his premises, but it was as if he had settled the issue by demanding that the secrets were not to be publicized and that one needed to think harder why Erdogan chose a soft narrative addressing this issue. Inside the Ankara beltway, some also link this soft-pedaling to Turkey’s own massive wiretapping of its own citizens. According to the president of the Turkish-German Foundation for Education and Scientific Research (TAVAK), Faruk Sen, Germany has obtained two key ammunitions against Turkey. One is the bank accounts in Swiss banks belonging to some Turkish leaders, and the other is critical information obtained through wiretapping. WikiLeaks revealed a December 2004 cable from US Ambassador Eric Edelman in Ankara to the State Department, which prompted severe reaction then. We have heard from two contacts that Erdogan has eight accounts in Swiss banks, Edelman wrote. Retired intelligence officers speaking to Al-Monitor said that while anything can be possible, it wouldn’t go beyond speculation at this stage to link these developments. Sen, on the other hand, told Bugun TV in an interview Aug. 26 that Ankara reduced the issue to a technical level by asking for a meeting between the heads of the two sides’ intelligence chiefs, and that this was not considered a political problem any longer. Sen also said that Germany wiretapped 3,000 people in Turkey, mostly bureaucrats, businessmen and journalists. According to the retired intelligence officers, what is clear is that the country is left with no secrets and that it has drastically failed in counterintelligence. If there were to be free press in the Russian Federation, we could have also easily added their activity in Turkey, one retired intelligence officer said, stressing the importance of counterintelligence and the need for Turkey to rebuild itself in these areas. All of them know more than we do about the country’s affairs, and this creates an ample environment for blackmail."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":392,"title":" How the German Foreign Intelligence Agency BND tapped the Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX in Frankfurt, since 2009","class":0,"body":" The German Foreign Intelligence Agency Bundesnachrichtendienst taps internet traffic directly at the Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX in Frankfurt since 2009, replacing predecessor operation „Eikonal at Deutsche Telekom. This was stated by the operator of DE-CIX at the German Parliamentary Committee investigating Intelligence Agency mass surveillance operations. The German Federal Chancellery intervened several times and prevented both a Parliamentary Commission and the Federal Network Agency from investigating this mass spying operation. Klaus Landfeld is head of industry group eco, which operates the Internet Exchange Point (IXP) DE-CIX in Frankfurt, Germany. News magazine „Der Spiegel reported in October 2013 that the German Foreign Intelligence Agency Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) is allowed to wiretap 25 Internet Service Providers at DE-CIX, including five German IXP and the traffic of multiple vendors, ideally within a single step. The „BND wanted access to the IXP and be able to say: today we want this cable, tomorrow maybe different ones. DE-CIX assumed the spies hat „to name individual, specific cables. But BND wanted „everything, „full access.DE-CIX analyzed the legal situation and concluded, that this is „not permitted in this way. Their criticism involved, among other things, the implementation of the 20-percent rule from the G-10-law, the Federal wiretap law described by Wikipedia as „similar to Britain’s Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and is comparable to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the United States. This G-10-law includes a limit that „strategic mass intercepts must be limited to a fifth of the „available bandwidth. DE-CIX legal opinion was, that the BND should only be allowed to intercept 20% of the actual occurring traffic per line, but the BND wanted everything.  On top of that, in „2009 there were different ideas of filtering systems to filter out traffic from German citizens who are protected by law. DE-CIX came to the conclusion: „We did not want to implement that.But in the „preparatory talk in August 2008, the BND ignored the concerns of DE-CIX: „If we are ignored as the operator, because we do not think this is permitted by law, this is only one-sided information access. Topics of the meeting were IXP works. The BND did not want access to specific fiber optic cables, but to all traffic of certain „Autonomous Systems (AS), which concerned several cables. Despite DE-CIX‘ criticism, the BND pushed for a implementation. After the meeting, DE-CIX contacted members of the Federal Parliament’s G-10 commission, which decides about wiretaps, similar to the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. „No one of the members wanted to talk to us, including the subsequent witness at Thursday’s inquiry hearing. Only since deceased Liberal politician Max Stadler agreed to a meeting, but said: „he can’t do anything. „That led to an appointment with the Chancellery, who told us that we were not allowed to talk to the G-10 commission, because the operation was not yet ordered. This was a „very unusual approach, „we were out under pressure. „If I am summoned by the Chancellery, this is not the rule of law, but power play. This meeting at the Chancellery took place on February 27, 2009. Afterwards, „nothing happened for a long time. The BND experienced „technical difficulties in implementation, it „was new for them, too.„Then we received a G-10 order, an order obliging a telecommunications provider to comply with surveillance requests, „which affected some providers, but not all of them. It was „significantly less than what was discussed back in 2008. This first order „also contained German providers and „German domestic cables, for example a „cable from Frankfurt to Berlin with 95 % German traffic. „German domestic Internet Access Providers, whose sole business is connecting cables in the region, therefore having at least one side of every communication always in Germany. I fail to see where the foreign traffic is here. The BND wanted to access traffic from German providers at DE-CIX, whose traffic they could have also received directly. „But right from the start, we thought that BND should contact the owners of the respective cables directly. Afterwards, DE-CIX „had discussions with companies that were affected by our order. They also asked themselves, why they were not contacted by the BND. In addition, the BND also wanted internet traffic from „other European countries and providers. International „transit traffic is considered as „beyond law anyways. DE-CIX continued to ask „why this is possible and „if all of this makes sense, but nevertheless followed the order in early 2009. Since 2009, the BND wiretaps DE-CIX in Frankfurt, and receives approximately „two percent of the bandwidth sold and theoretically available. The German government thinks, that this information is irrelevant to the investigation committee, because it does not happen in direct cooperation with the Five Eyes. Usually „the entire cable traffic is mirrored. What happens afterwards is out-of-reach for the providers, we cannot check they comply with the rules and laws. DE-CIX has „a formal auditing duty, but we cannot put that into practice. Landefeld wants a technical guideline for these „strategic mass interception measures, analogous to the monitoring regulations in classical telecommunication surveillance. There, „everything is documented down to the last bit. For G-10 there is nothing. Landefeld thinks „that the law as it is written does not meet the requirements of modern communication networks any more.To monitor internet telephony, one „has to record all VoIP-connections and save them, for technical reasons. Only afterwards, they can be analyzed. It is undefined „how long these recordings can be retained. „Can you listen to 100 percent of the telephone traffic because that’s within the 20 percent? My definition is different. The Federal Network Agency „Bundesnetzagentur proposed a solution: to apply the 20-percent rule „at the application layer, so that, for instance, the number of e-mails, web pages, etc. […] is reduced by randomized automatic deletion. Landefeld appreciates this idea: „These are the kinds of technical solutions I am looking for. Currently, „there are no checks and balances outside of the secret agencies. „At the moment, these questions are only defined by the „internal lawyers of the BND: „This can’t be!, Landfeld said. „Previously, other communication exchange points in Düsseldorf and Hamburg had been wiretapped by the BND, too. The entire foreign telephony communication was running through these old switching points of the former federal post office, now Deutsche Telekom. Although DE-CIX had „doubts about the legality of the G-10 orders, Landefeld would not say whether they „took legal action. Eco has „several lawyers dealing with this topic. Also external ones. We have ongoing debates since mid-2014. But „well-established case law is very thin, the number of decisions vanishingly small. You cannot claim, that there is an established constitutional opinion about this topic.The BND claims that so called „transit traffic between two foreign states „can be passed on to foreign intelligence services, like the NSA, the „Google of intelligence agencies. Intelligence agencies „engage in a flourishing trade of data, a „business like any other. „In technical circles it has been talked about repeatedly, that intelligence agencies „trade entire traffic streams. „Everyone in the scene has heard that intelligence agencies exchange traffic, it’s an „open secret. On June 14, 2013 Landefeld was invited to the Ministry of Economic Affairs by the former Minister of Justice Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and Minister of Economics Philipp Roesler, who wanted to receive „initial information after the PRISM-revelations: „The whole problem was unknown inside of the ministries. They had absolutely no knowledge of what is happening in Germany and what the usual practices are. We were very surprised. After all, what the US has been accused of, is also happening in Germany in one way or another.In early July 2013, Landefeld called the Intelligence Coordinator at the Federal Chancellery and asked what he should answer in response to media inquiries, because „by saying ’no comment‘ I would also admit it. The intelligence coordinator „said I wouldn’t have to invent anything and wouldn’t have to lie.He still wants more rights to speak publicly, because „if a measure is within the law, you should also be allowed to talk about it in a general form, obviously not about details. In other countries, this is possible: „In the UK, I can talk about it openly. They are obviously not disturbed by that. In Germany you „cannot even say that you had contact with BND. The self-understanding of the agencies is strange. On July 16 and 24, 2013, there had been „discussions with the Federal Network Agency, with a lot of stake holders and the Attorney General.„On July 24, some stakeholders wanted to know, why they do not have [the revealed] access [of the the NSA] at their disposal and why they do not have access to German domestic traffic. The demand for their own PRISM appeared rapidly. At that time, the DE-CIX wiretap was not discussed, „in 2013 it was still held under a lid.On August 9, 2013 the Federal Network Agency „Bundesnetzagentur held a hearing with telecommunications companies. In preparation, they sent out a questionnaire to the companies, including the questions, „Does your business run monitoring devices […] to implement so-called strategic restrictions under […] G-10 law? and „Do you adhere to the rules for logging the use of this equipment and the control of these logs? In response, Landefeld called the Chancellery again and asked, „how to answer these questions. Afterwards, the Chancellery called the Federal Network Agency Vice President and said: „the companies must not answer these questions and the „Network Agency was not allowed to ask these questions.Foreign intelligence agencies did not openly approach DE-CIX: „There was no contact attempt. If there had been, we would have rejected them immediately. The DE-CIX IXP in New York is operated by DE-CIX North America Inc., a subsidiary of the German company DE-CIX which is subject to US law. „If there are mass surveillance orders, the involved parties are not allowed to talk about it. However, there haven’t been any FISA orders at DE-CIX North America yet: „I can talk about that, because there were no orders. However, if there are, they would have to remain secret. Even DE-CIX IXP UAE-IX in Dubai has to „comply with the legal provisions of the country.Foreign companies in Germany, including German subsidiaries, are also obliged by their home country laws to pass Internet traffic to their secret services. The companies are fighting a „two-sided war: according to German law you are not allowed to ex-filtrate data from Germany, according to US law you are obliged. In result, the providers have to choose the lesser of two evils. Landefeld pointed out, that „routers in Germany are often not operated domestically, but from a Network Operations Center (NOC) in the USA. As a consequence, employees in Germany have „limited influence on their configuration. Technically, it would be possible for intelligence agencies to get undiscovered back-door access, if the switch or operating system is compromised. But this „requires a cable to ex-filtrate the data. This could theoretically be done with a „cable under a cover-up. It has been implied by the head of the committee that this could be implemented in the future. As an advisor, Landefeld has seen intelligence agencies ex-filtrating mass traffic both with and without co-operation of the network operators. „Every major switch supports [ex-filtrating data] and has lawful interception functionalities, because of laws like the American Communications Assistance for Law US Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). In the US, the „implementation of surveillance measures happens „fully automated, triggered by the authorities. This is technically integrated into the systems. In Germany, such measures are currently „only prevented by the legal need for individual evidence for surveillance measures. Therefore, German providers still confirm surveillance taps by ‚clicking a check-box‘.DE-CIX employs a four-person security team that analyzes hardware and software. In addition, DE-CIX is IT certified and evaluated annually by the Federal Office for Information Security. Since the Snowden revelations, DE-CIX also tries to mitigate the uncovered scenarios. Currently, they are implementing „traffic counters on individual ports, to make sure that the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic match. Asked about his personal experiences as an expert in the field of industrial security, Landfeld reported a concrete example of „industrial espionage against a mechanical engineering company: I „learned of occurrences, where people showed up at business customers premises, claiming to be from a communication provider. This is real, I went through this scenario with several customers. They „even interrupted fibre optic cables to produce interruptions. Then someone showed up who ‚fixed‘ the situation by exchanging regular routers with compromised routers."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":393,"title":" Web snooping is a dangerous move","class":0,"body":" (CNN) -- On Monday, The New York Times reported that President Obama will seek sweeping laws enabling law enforcement to more easily eavesdrop on the internet. Technologies are changing, the administration argues, and modern digital systems aren't as easy to monitor as traditional telephones. The government wants to force companies to redesign their communications systems and information networks to facilitate surveillance, and to provide law enforcement with back doors that enable them to bypass any security measures. The proposal may seem extreme, but -- unfortunately -- it's not unique. Just a few months ago, the governments of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and India threatened to ban BlackBerry devices unless the company made eavesdropping easier. China has already built a massive internet surveillance system to better control its citizens. Formerly reserved for totalitarian countries, this wholesale surveillance of citizens has moved into the democratic world as well. Governments like Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom are debating or passing laws giving their police new powers of internet surveillance, in many cases requiring communications system providers to redesign products and services they sell. More are passing data retention laws, forcing companies to retain customer data in case they might need to be investigated later. Obama isn't the first U.S. president to seek expanded digital eavesdropping. The 1994 CALEA law required phone companies to build ways to better facilitate FBI eavesdropping into their digital phone switches. Since 2001, the National Security Agency has built substantial eavesdropping systems within the United States. These laws are dangerous, both for citizens of countries like China and citizens of Western democracies. Forcing companies to redesign their communications products and services to facilitate government eavesdropping reduces privacy and liberty; that's obvious. But the laws also make us less safe. Communications systems that have no inherent eavesdropping capabilities are more secure than systems with those capabilities built in. Any surveillance system invites both criminal appropriation and government abuse. Function creep is the most obvious abuse: New police powers, enacted to fight terrorism, are already used in situations of conventional nonterrorist crime. Internet surveillance and control will be no different. Official misuses are bad enough, but the unofficial uses are far more worrisome. An infrastructure conducive to surveillance and control invites surveillance and control, both by the people you expect and the people you don't. Any surveillance and control system must itself be secured, and we're not very good at that. Why does anyone think that only authorized law enforcement will mine collected internet data or eavesdrop on Skype and IM conversations? These risks are not theoretical. After 9/11, the National Security Agency built a surveillance infrastructure to eavesdrop on telephone calls and e-mails within the United States. Although procedural rules stated that only non-Americans and international phone calls were to be listened to, actual practice didn't always match those rules. NSA analysts collected more data than they were authorized to and used the system to spy on wives, girlfriends and famous people like former President Bill Clinton. The most serious known misuse of a telecommunications surveillance infrastructure took place in Greece. Between June 2004 and March 2005, someone wiretapped more than 100 cell phones belonging to members of the Greek government -- the prime minister and the ministers of defense, foreign affairs and justice -- and other prominent people. Ericsson built this wiretapping capability into Vodafone's products, but enabled it only for governments that requested it. Greece wasn't one of those governments, but some still unknown party -- a rival political group? organized crime? -- figured out how to surreptitiously turn the feature on. Surveillance infrastructure is easy to export. Once surveillance capabilities are built into Skype or Gmail or your BlackBerry, it's easy for more totalitarian countries to demand the same access; after all, the technical work has already been done. Western companies such as Siemens, Nokia and Secure Computing built Iran's surveillance infrastructure, and U.S. companies like L-1 Identity Solutions helped build China's electronic police state. The next generation of worldwide citizen control will be paid for by countries like the United States. We should be embarrassed to export eavesdropping capabilities. Secure, surveillance-free systems protect the lives of people in totalitarian countries around the world. They allow people to exchange ideas even when the government wants to limit free exchange. They power citizen journalism, political movements and social change. For example, Twitter's anonymity saved the lives of Iranian dissidents -- anonymity that many governments want to eliminate. Yes, communications technologies are used by both the good guys and the bad guys. But the good guys far outnumber the bad guys, and it's far more valuable to make sure they're secure than it is to cripple them on the off chance it might help catch a bad guy. It's like the FBI demanding that no automobiles drive above 50 mph, so they can more easily pursue getaway cars. It might or might not work -- but, regardless, the cost to society of the resulting slowdown would be enormous. It's bad civic hygiene to build technologies that could someday be used to facilitate a police state. No matter what the eavesdroppers say, these systems cost too much and put us all at greater risk."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":394,"title":" India sets up elaborate system to tap phone calls, e-mail","class":0,"body":" India has launched a wide-ranging surveillance programme that will give its security agencies and even income tax officials the ability to tap directly into e-mails and phone calls without oversight by courts or parliament, several sources said. The expanded surveillance in the world's most populous democracy, which the government says will help safeguard national security, has alarmed privacy advocates at a time when allegations of massive U.S. digital snooping beyond American shores has set off a global furore. If India doesn't want to look like an authoritarian regime, it needs to be transparent about who will be authorized to collect data, what data will be collected, how it will be used, and how the right to privacy will be protected, said Cynthia Wong, an Internet researcher at New York-based Human Rights Watch. The Central Monitoring System (CMS) was announced in 2011 but there has been no public debate and the government has said little about how it will work or how it will ensure that the system is not abused. The government started to quietly roll the system out state by state in April this year, according to government officials. Eventually it will be able to target any of India's 900 million landline and mobile phone subscribers and 120 million Internet users. Interior ministry spokesman K.S. Dhatwalia said he did not have details of CMS and therefore could not comment on the privacy concerns. A spokeswoman for the telecommunications ministry, which will oversee CMS, did not respond to queries. Indian officials said making details of the project public would limit its effectiveness as a clandestine intelligence-gathering tool. Security of the country is very important. All countries have these surveillance programmes, said a senior telecommunications ministry official, defending the need for a large-scale eavesdropping system like CMS. You can see terrorists getting caught, you see crimes being stopped. You need surveillance. This is to protect you and your country, said the official, who is directly involved in setting up the project. He did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject. The new system will allow the government to listen to and tape phone conversations, read e-mails and text messages, monitor posts on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn and track searches on Google of selected targets, according to interviews with two other officials involved in setting up the new surveillance programme, human rights activists and cyber experts. In 2012, India sent in 4,750 requests to Google Inc for user data, the highest in the world after the United States. Security agencies will no longer need to seek a court order for surveillance or depend, as they do now, on Internet or telephone service providers to give them the data, the government officials said. Government intercept data servers are being built on the premises of private telecommunications firms. These will allow the government to tap into communications at will without telling the service providers, according to the officials and public documents. The top bureaucrat in the federal interior ministry and his state-level deputies will have the power to approve requests for surveillance of specific phone numbers, e-mails or social media accounts, the government officials said. While it is not unusual for governments to have equipment at telecommunication companies and service providers, they are usually required to submit warrants or be subject to other forms of independent oversight. Bypassing courts is really very dangerous and can be easily misused, said Pawan Sinha, who teaches human rights at Delhi University. In most countries in Europe and in the United States, security agencies were obliged to seek court approval or had to function with legal oversight, he said. The senior telecommunications ministry official dismissed suggestions that India's system could be open to abuse. The home secretary has to have some substantial intelligence input to approve any kind of call tapping or call monitoring. He is not going to randomly decide to tape anybody's phone calls, he said. If at all the government reads your e-mails, or taps your phone, that will be done for a good reason. It is not invading your privacy, it is protecting you and your country, he said. The government has arrested people in the past for critical social media posts although there have been no prosecutions. In 2010, India's Outlook news magazine accused intelligence officials of tapping telephone calls of several politicians, including a government minister. The accusations were never proven, but led to a political uproar. The many abuses of phone tapping make clear that that is not a good way to organise the system of checks and balances, said Anja Kovacs, a fellow at the New Delhi-based Centre for Internet and Society. When similar rules are used for even more extensive monitoring and surveillance, as seems to be the case with CMS, the dangers of abuse and their implications for individuals are even bigger. Nine government agencies will be authorised to make intercept requests, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India's elite policy agency, the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the domestic spy agency, and the income tax department. India does not have a formal privacy law and the new surveillance system will operate under the Indian Telegraph Act - a law formulated by the British in 1885 - which gives the government freedom to monitor private conversations. We are obligated by law to give access to our networks to every legal enforcement agency, said Rajan Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India. Telecommunications companies Bharti Airtel, Vodafone's India unit, Idea Cellular, Tata Communications and state-run MTNL did not respond to requests for comment. India has a long history of violence by separatist groups and other militants within its borders. More than one third of India's 670 districts are affected by such violence, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal. The government has escalated efforts to monitor the activities of militant groups since a Pakistan-based militant squad rampaged through Mumbai in 2008, killing 166 people. Monitoring of telephones and the Internet are part of the surveillance. India's junior minister for information technology, Milind Deora, said the new data collection system would actually improve citizens' privacy because telecommunications companies would no longer be directly involved in the surveillance - only government officials would. The mobile company will have no knowledge about whose phone conversation is being intercepted, Deora told a Google Hangout, an online forum, earlier this month."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":395,"title":" Report says Japan included in embassies wiretapped by the US government","class":0,"body":" A report from British newspaper The Guardian’s online edition says that the National Security Agency wiretapped 38 embassies in the United States, including Japan and other foreign missions to the United Nations. This is part of a series of revelations about surveillance activities from the agency based on documents leaked by former Central Intelligence Agency employee Edward Snowden. The controversial documents allegedly show that the NSA wiretapped all sorts of communications of foreign embassies based in Washington, including Japan, South Korea, the European Union, India, Mexico, Turkey, France, Italy, Greece and Middle Eastern countries. The documents called the embassies under surveillance targets, but doesn’t specify for what. If the documents are proven to be true, this is the first time that any Japanese diplomatic facility on US soil has been under surveillance. It is believed that the NSA put eavesdropping devices at the embassies and foreign missions, particularly on their electronic communication devices like telephones, emails, etc. The information was then transmitted through cables to special antennas. The NSA also apparently monitored emails found through the servers of the nine Internet giants in the US. It is suspected that the NSA tapped the European Union office in the US to understand the conflicts between the different EU member countries on various global issues. As for the purpose of wiretapping the Japanese embassy, it still remains unclear. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said they have no comments at this time as they still have to confirm and examine the reports through diplomatic channels. It is still too early to assess whether these revelations will affect Japan-US relations significantly."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":396,"title":" New Snowden leak: US bugged dozens of foreign embassies","class":0,"body":" The US has been spying on dozens of foreign embassies and missions belonging to its rivals and allies in America to keep tabs on disagreements between them, new documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed. Elaborate means were used to install bugs and gather intelligence. One document mentioned in the Guardian report on the leaks lists 38 foreign embassies and mission in US and describes them as targets under surveillance. Targets in the September 2010 document included not only US rivals, but also American allies, such as EU mission in New York and its embassy in Washington, along with the French, Italian and Greek embassies, as well as Japan, Mexico, South Korea, India, Turkey and Middle Eastern countries. But the UK and Germany, along with some other European states were not mentioned. US intelligence used a number of creative spying techniques, including bugging electronic communications equipment and tapping into cables to collect transmissions with specialized antennae. One of the eavesdropping methods was codenamed Dropmire and involved putting a bug in an encrypted fax machine used at the EU embassy in Washington, DC, the Guardian quoted a 2007 document as saying. The fax machine was used to send cables to foreign affairs ministries in EU. The US spied in order to gain insight into policy disagreements on global issues and other splits between member states, the leaked document revealed. US spy operations on dozens of foreign embassies and mission in US had a range of creative codenames. An operation carried out in the EU mission at the UN and was called ‘Perdido’. It collected intelligence through implants or bugs that were placed inside electronic devices, along with targeted computers inside the mission copying everything saved on its hard drives. The EU delegation on K Street in Washington was hit with three spy operations that targeted the embassy's 90 staff. Two of them used electronic implants and the third used antennas to collect transmissions. Codename ‘Blackfoot’ was used in an operation against the French mission to the UN and the name ‘Wabash’ referred to bugging the French embassy in Washington. The Italian embassy in Washington was also targeted and codenamed as both ‘Bruneau’ and ‘Hemlock’. Spying on the Greek UN mission was named ‘Powell’ and the operation against its embassy was known as ‘Klondyke’, documents revealed. The operations are described as close access domestic collection and it remains unclear whether NSA solely carried its operations or in combination with FBI or CIA. The new leak comes as European nations are already angry by what Snowden has revealed. France and Germany have demanded the US account for leaked reports of massive-scale US spying on the EU. French President Francois Hollande called for an end to surveillance, while Germany said such Cold War-style behavior was unacceptable. German publication Der Spiegel reported on Sunday that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had bugged EU offices in Brussels, New York and Washington. Following the release of the report, the president of the EU parliament demanded an explanation from Washington, stressing that if the allegations were true there would be a significant backlash on US-EU relations. Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee and ex-staff member of a private contractor working for the NSA, disclosed secret documents revealing US surveillance programs and British secret Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) sharing its intelligence with NSA, as part of the Tempora data collection project. Snowden left the US for Hong Kong in May and currently remains in the transit area of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport while Ecuador reviews his asylum request. The US has charged Snowden with espionage and is trying to extradite him."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":397,"title":" Is Abe’s ‘Soft Spine’ toward the US Just a Ploy?","class":0,"body":" The website WikiLeaks has revealed that since 2006, the United States has wiretapped 37 key targets within Japan. The news resonated strongly among the Japanese public, with some officials even going so far as to label the U.S. methods as simply shameless and base. Oddly, however, the atmosphere among Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet was decidedly unperturbed, with Abe only producing a statement that Japan must check the true intentions of the United States four days after the initial announcement. The domestic response came in the form of the Japanese opposition camp expressing extreme indignation at such submissiveness and widespread dissatisfaction among the general population, with some website users scornfully remarking that Japan had been neutered as a nation. Facing this surge of popular opinion, Abe had no choice but to hold a phone conference with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Aug. 5 to express his protest at the wiretapping. Japan is not the first U.S. ally to have its leaders monitored in such fashion. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff issued statements strongly condemning the spying as soon as it was discovered that they had been targeted. So why has Abe, who has always made a point of showing strength toward regional neighbors, now lost his backbone? According to the observations of this author, Abe's spinelessness when it comes to the United States is likely a result of the following three factors. First is the need to prioritize his guarantee to pass security-related legislation. As everyone knows, bolstered by the ruling coalition's absolute majority in the Japanese Diet, Abe guaranteed to the U.S. Congress during his visit to the United States in May that he would pass security-related legislation before the end of the year, enabling a seamless response between the Japan Self-Defense Force and U.S. military and turning Japan into a comprehensive war machine capable of following the United States in and out of battle around the world. However, the security bill hit a roadblock in Japan due to resistance from the opposition party, the majority of academics, and more than 60 percent of the general population. In a country where large-scale gatherings have been rare over the past several decades, there suddenly appeared a succession of marches and demonstrations to demand that the security legislation be scrapped. Although Japan’s House of Representatives powered the bill through, it had yet to gain the approval of the House of Councillors, an endeavor that was already shaping up to be a spectacular fight. It was at this junction that the news of U.S. wiretapping appeared out of the blue to throw another wrench in Abe's plans. If Abe were to make a show of strength toward the United States, it very likely would have affected the security legislation that his party was putting all its efforts into passing, leaving the prime minister with little choice but to try to play things down. Second is that the United States and Japan have a tacit understanding of each other’s calculus. As all are aware, the alliance between the two nations was originally built upon the unequal relationship that followed Japan's defeat in World War II and the U.S. military's subsequent occupation of the country, and from the very beginning the two nations each had their own separate objectives. That situation has continued to unfold to where we are today. As the United States wishes to maintain control over East Asia (or even all of Asia), it needs Japan to be its muscle in the region, but at the same time, the United States also needs to watch Japan closely lest the island nation's growing power embolden it to turn against its wartime adversary once again. On the other hand, Japan will depend even more upon the might of the United States to fulfill its desire to maintain its prestige as the dominant power within Asia. While a subconscious impulse to cast off U.S. control exists within the very bones of Japan, until such a time as it is powerful enough to do so, it still needs U.S. support. This sort of latent conflict, with the United States and Japan both using each other while not letting down their guard, necessitates that on the surface they make a show of joining hands, but also that they never cease probing for what cards the other has hidden. As an old hand at the final table, Abe knows how the game is played and that such goings-on are common for both parties, and consequently he doesn't feel compelled to kick up a fuss. Much better to simply smooth things over and drop a few innuendos around the subject, all with the understanding that in the future, well, you gotta do what you gotta do. Third, one cannot exclude the possibility that Japan is quietly biding its time, absorbing such slights and only momentarily feigning anger to win even greater trust and support from the United States in service of something greater. There is a well-known story in Japan regarding the 47 ronin, loyal samurai who seek revenge for the unjust end brought upon their master by silently enduring humiliation and even feigning madness in order to deceive the enemy, successfully accomplishing their sworn purpose in the end. This story was later rewritten into a television drama that became popular throughout Japan, and has been called a classic example of Bushido loyalty. For Abe, who is himself a fervent admirer of the Bushido code, such Dantèsque patience should be within his blood. When his typical modus operandi is to not allow even the smallest of slights to go unpunished, who yet knows but that his swallowing his anger today may be a small sacrifice in order to realize some grand design. As for what exactly that grand design may be, I fear his ambition makes it only all too clear."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":398,"title":" WikiLeaks: U.S. wiretapped Brazilian presidents","class":0,"body":" The U.S. National Security Agency wiretapped several key Brazilian government officials including President Dilma Rousseff, her secretary and her chief of staff, according to WikiLeaks documents disclosed Saturday. The group says the NSA eavesdropped on 29 key Brazilian government phone numbers, listening in on conversations taking place on Rousseff's palace office line and her presidential jet phone as well as on phones of Brazil's foreign minister, ambassadors and military chiefs. The United States also waged an economic espionage campaign against Brazil by spying on those responsible for managing Brazil's economy, including the head of its Central Bank, WikiLeaks says. Our publication today shows the U.S. has a long way to go to prove its dragnet surveillance on 'friendly' governments is over, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement. The U.S. has not just (been) targeting President Rousseff but the key figures she talks to every day. He added that any U.S. assurances of ceasing its targeting of Rousseff cannot be trusted, and Rousseff herself must guarantee that the spying has stopped on her and on all Brazilian issues. WikiLeaks further detailed the NSA's intensive interception of Brazilian phones, saying the agency targeted Brazil's diplomacy by spying on the country's ambassadors to the United States, Germany, France, the European Union and Geneva. Other targets included the cellphone of Luiz Alberto Figueiredo Machado, former minister of foreign affairs from 2013 to 2015 and current Brazilian ambassador to the United States, as well as army Gen. Jose Elito Carvalho Siqueira, who is the director of the institutional security cabinet, an executive cabinet office responsible for the direct and immediate assistance to the president on matters of national security and defense policy. Several Brazilian officials expressed anger over the latest revelations, reported The Intercept, a journalism group that reports on leaked NSA documents. Gilberto Carvalho, former chief of staff to former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and a top aide to Rouseff, harshly denounced the spying in an interview with the publication. Carvalho described his reaction to The Intercept as maximum indignation, declaring it a violation of Brazilian sovereignty, which the U.S. does not have the right to do. He added the fact that Brazil is trying to repair our relationship with the U.S. does not in any way diminish the gravity of these new revelations. Last month, documents released by WikiLeaks revealed the United States wiretapped the past three presidents of France, including current leader Francois Hollande as recently as 2012. The documents said the United States eavesdropped on presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac as well as Hollande on issues that included the French positions on eurozone economic policy, United Nations appointments, Middle East peace talks and the financial crisis of 2008. France rejected an asylum request by Julian Assange on Friday. The Australian has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning about alleged sexual assaults. Ecuador has said Assange can stay indefinitely in the embassy. He was granted asylum by Ecuador in the first place based on reasonable fear of prosecution by the United States, which is pursuing a national security case against him."}

In response to questions raised by Parliament members on the wiretapping activities of Turkish intelligence agents, MİT noted that all wireless communications were susceptible to being intercepted and followed by other countries. The notion that it is not possible to wiretap phone operators owned by foreign companies is false. The secret wiretapping and monitoring devices produced by countries with developed technologies are used by intelligence agencies before their commercialization, the statement read. It also added that all software programs of foreign operators were analyzed due to the fact that they might reveal the personal information of Turkish citizens if there were security vulnerabilities in the system. Following the analysis, we made the necessary warnings, the statement read, noting that most of the intelligence officers were well-educated and specialized in these domains.

{"id":400,"title":" Google and AT&T have been dragged into the wiretapping allegations against Apple","class":0,"body":" Google and AT&T have both filed motions in a US federal lawsuit that alleges Apple wire-tapped users who ditched their iPhones for Android phones. The entry of the two companies into the Apple lawsuit will be interesting because it raises the possibility that both of them will get a look at some of Apple's internal communications and documents regarding a three-year-long technical fiasco in which iPhones could not reliably send text messages to Android phones. Apple finally fixed the problem earlier this year. UPDATE: A judge dismissed the lawsuit's bid for class action status and Apple has asked a judge to dismiss the case. The plaintiffs — former Apple customers Adrienne Moore and Adam Bachaut — are claiming that Apple's iMessage system prevented text messages sent from iPhones from being delivered to Android phones if the phone number had previously been used for an iPhone. Moore and Backhaut were both former iPhone users who switched to Android phones and then found that they were not receiving texts from other iPhone users. They claim that iPhone texts are illegally intercepted and interned by Apple when sent to Android users. The intercepted messages are held indefinitely, the suit claims, and that allegedly counts as unauthorized access to a computer system and a violation of both the Stored Communications Act and the Federal Wiretap Act. (The specific flaw in iMessage was that once a phone number was registered as an iPhone number via Apple's iCloud system, then messages were not delivered if the phone was not attached to iCloud. Android phones, of course, can't connect to iCloud.) It is possible to transfer a phone number from an iPhone to an Android, but as many customers found to their cost, you could only do that successfully by following this multi-step, 45-day-long procedure. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The company has argued that the lawsuits should be thrown out. Apple can’t wire tap its own facilities, the company's lawyers have argued. Users authorise and consent to Apple accessing their iMessages, and because Apple acted in good faith and without the necessary intent to literally spy on texts to Android customers, there is no case, the company has said in court. Google and AT&T have both filed motions requesting that material they disclose in the lawsuit's discovery phase will be kept confidential, under seal. So we won't know exactly what they're telling Apple or the plaintiffs, or what Google and AT&T will learn from Apple, if anything. Google, naturally, will be curious to know what Apple's employees knew about the way iMessage hobbled text-delivery to Android, and how fast Apple moved to fix it. AT&T's appearance in the case is also interesting because former AT&T and Apple employees have told Business Insider in emails that they lost sales on Android phones because of the issue. Customers would return new Androids to the store when they discovered they weren't receiving texts, and swap them for iPhones. Apple has requested — and been granted — permission to conduct much of the litigation in secrecy. So we don't know how much of Apple's internal information will ever see the light of day. However, one filing in the case requests that certain internal emails remain confidential, including one addressed to CEO Tim Cook on April 28, 2013. The email has been sealed. Other papers indicate that several Apple employees have been required to write affidavits about what they knew, or been questioned in depositions. Those employees include Justin Wood (an engineering manager), Andre Boule (software engineer) Gokul Thirumalai (engineering manager), AmolPattekar (an engineer), Bill Heilman (senior director, AppleCare engineering & enterprise support),  John Kelly (manager of Wireless diagnostics) and Jeffrey Kehlmann and Laura Heckman, whose roles at Apple are unclear. The fact that so many of those job titles are in software or engineering suggests that the litigation is focusing in part on exactly how iMessage handled texts that were not being delivered to Android phones. Below, we have collected a few highlights from the case, which give you a taste of just how far Apple has gone to make sure no one sees what is going on in the case."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":401,"title":"NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY LAUNCHED","class":0,"body":"Today, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, launched the UK’s new National Cyber Security Strategy – unveiling a £1.9 billion plan for the protection from cyber threats for the next five years. The new strategy, which almost doubles the investment of the previous 2011 strategy, has the vision that by 2021 the UK is secure and resilient to cyber threats, prosperous and confident in the digital world. It identifies three key areas of implementation: defence, deter, and develop. ‘Defence’ involves protecting critical national infrastructure (CNI), such as energy and transport, as well as government websites and emails. This part of the strategy’s implementation plan also looks at changing public and business behaviours, giving them the knowledge and ability to defend themselves. ‘Deter’ will see, in the words of Hammond, a significant amount of the investment in enhancing Britain’s sovereign capabilities, deterring terrorism, countering hostile foreign actors, and reducing cyber crime – making the UK a hard target. Where the strategy foresees taking the fight to those who threaten Britain in cyberspace, promising that the UK will retaliate against cyber attacks with offensive cyber capabilities. ‘Develop’ aims at building capacity and developing the skills of young people in schools and university, stimulating growth in the cyber security sector, as well as promoting and researching cyber security science and technology. Underpinning these three strands of the implementation plan is the pursuit of ‘international action’ – where the government will exert influence by investing in partnerships that shape the global evolution of cyberspace in a manner that advanced our wider economic and security interests. The UK will allocate a proportion of the £165 million Defence and Cyber Innovation Fund to support innovative procurement in defence and security. In his speech, Hammond also highlighted that industry in the broadest sense have a part to play in cyber security, and that old legacy IT systems used by many organisations in the UK are highly vulnerable to malicious actors. While promising government support, he stressed that companies have a duty to ensure their own networks are secure. The new strategy is a continued recognition from the government of the threat that cyber risks pose to the livelihoods of citizens, British industry, and the country as a whole. Previously, in May 2016, Matt Hancock MP in his former role as Minister for Cabinet Office, officially announced the launch of a National Cyber Security Centre which will act as a one-stop-shop for businesses seeking advice and support when dealing with cyber security issues. In 2015, the National Security Strategy identified cyber security as a tier 1 risk – the same level of risk as terrorism and global instability."}

Cyber Outreach brings real world cyber issues facing the workforce to life, and can be delivered to groups of up to 30 at a time. Today marks the end of Connect Smart Week, aimed at improving the cyber security awareness and capability of individuals in the workplace. Communications Minister, Amy Adams, launched Connect Smart Week on Monday, drawing attention to recent Colmar Brunton research showing that only 17% of New Zealanders have received cyber security awareness training at work. This despite the fact that sophisticated, targeted attacks on employees are on the increase. This statistic alone shows just how far behind we are in cyber security awareness. In a similar survey in the US last year only 45% had received no training at work.

The initiative is being championed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and £50m will be set aside over the next five years to establish two innovation accelerator centres. The first will be located in Cheltenham and is expected to open at the beginning of 2017. A second centre will open in London later in 2017. Both will be run by Wayra, which has been involved for several years in helping startups to develop ideas. Firms interested in taking part can now register to be included in the official GCHQ Cyber Accelerator via the Wayra website. Applications are open until 17 October. Successful startups will join the accelerator in early 2017. We are looking for companies who are using novel techniques to solve real, existing cyber security problems, and digital companies whose products could be applied in a cyber security context, the site said. In addition, we would be interested in next-generation solutions that are faster, better and cheaper than those which already exist and which lower the bar to entry. Notably, firms chosen to be part of the accelerator will also gain access to GCHQ staff and technology to understand the sort of threats they face, and to expand capability, improve ideas and devise cutting-edge products to outpace current and emerging threats. Chris Ensor, deputy director for cyber skills and growth at GCHQ, explained that working in this open way is vital for the future security of the UK. Cyber security is a team sport and, as threats become more prolific and more complex, we should be sharing our experiences and views because there’s so much we can learn from each other, he said. Combining the knowledge and experience of GCHQ staff with some of the country’s newest startups and most creative entrepreneurs is a really powerful combination that will deliver benefits to the cyber security of the UK. The threat to the UK from cyber attacks is growing at an alarming rate. Ciaran Martin, CEO of the newly established National Cyber Security Centre, revealed recently that the UK government logs over 200 national security-level cyber incidents every month. Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital and Culture, added that the new centres demonstrate the seriousness with which the government takes the issue of cyber security. Our two new Cyber Innovation Centres will bring together government, academic and business expertise, and will be invaluable in helping support startup companies and develop world-class cyber technology, he said. Despite this, the government has been criticised for its own cyber security strategies.

Earlier today, NBC News, a news organization that is usually extremely friendly to the Obama administration, reported that numerous current and former government officials have told them the White House had asked the CIA to deliver options for a wide-ranging clandestine cyber operation designed to harass and embarrass the Kremlin leadership. According to NBC, the sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the CIA was considering but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors, selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation. Former intelligence officers told NBC News that the agency had gathered reams of documents that could expose unsavory tactics by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vice President Joe Biden Confirms Obama Admin Plans to Send Message to Putin Vice President Joe Biden told Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd on Friday that we’re sending a message to Putin and that it will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact. Hacks, Nuclear Missile Tests, and Threats of Nuclear War Tensions with Russia are at an all-time high, as the Obama administration continues to make allegations and threats against the Russian government. On Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry threatened to retaliate against Russia, citing unsubstantiated claims that Russia is somehow trying to hack into U.S. election databases to influence the Presidential election. We released this information to put the people doing it on a notice that they’re not, quote, ‘getting away with it’ for free, as well as to put states on notice that we’re serious when we say they need to take every measure possible to guarantee the integrity of our elections, Kerry said Monday at The Internet Association’s Virtuous Cycle Conference. And we will and can respond in ways that we choose to at the time of our choice. Presidential Executive Order for Cyber Warfare In 2013, The Obama administration started laying the groundwork for launching a Pre-emptive cyber strike against rogue nations. According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama concluded a secret legal review of the administration’s new cyber war guidelines. The guidelines give President Obama the power to order pre-emptive cyber strikes to protect national security interests Last year, President Obama took the unprecedented and unconstitutional action of declaring a National Emergency to deal with cyber threats. White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael Daniel claimed the executive order was needed to give the President a spectrum of tools to combat cyber-attacks, by supplementing current diplomatic, law enforcement, military, economic and intelligence capabilities. It is designed to fill in a gap that we have identified where individuals carrying out significant malicious cyber-attacks are located in places that it’s difficult for our diplomatic and law enforcement tools to reach – whether because they’re behind the borders of a country that has weak cybersecurity laws, or the government is complicit in or turning a blind eye to the activity that is happening, and we don’t have good law enforcement relationships or other kinds of relationships, he said on a press call. So what we’re doing is putting in place a tool that will enable us to impose costs on those actors. Poking the Bear: Russian Television Warns of Nuclear War According to ABC News, earlier this month Russia held a large-scale civil defense drill across the country, meant to prepare people for disasters, among them nuclear catastrophe. The drill, which Russian authorities claimed affected 40 million people, and particularly the way it was presented on state television, resembled Soviet-era exercises, with scenes of schoolchildren flooding out in evacuations and being taught to hurriedly pull on gas masks As tensions rise, ABC is reporting that Russian media outlets have begun running public service announcements asking people whether they are ready for nuclear war. One report, on Russian State Run Media NTV, told people to find out where their neighborhood’s nearest bomb shelter was. If it should one day happen, every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is.

Ordinary households are just as vulnerable to hi-tech criminals as major companies, the top Tory is set to claim. Mr Hammond will outline the threats as he launches the Government’s latest National Cyber Security Strategy. He said last night: Britain is already an acknowledged global leader in cyber security thanks to our investment of over £860million in the last Parliament, but we must now keep up with the scale and pace of the threats we face. Our new strategy, underpinned by £1.9billion of support over five years and excellent partnerships with industry and academia, will allow us to take even greater steps to defend ourselves in cyberspace and to strike back when we are attacked. While risks to air traffic control and power grids are already understood, he will also highlight how the threat of attacks invade our privacy. A new Cyber Security Research Institute - a virtual collection of UK universities - will look to improve the security of smart phones, tablets and laptops. It could mean passwords are no longer needed. The Treasury said Mr Hammond would explain how increasingly vulnerable society is to cyber attacks thanks to the expanding range of connected devices which are creating more opportunities for exploitation. The growing use of web-connected devices means everyone from the living room to the boardroom is exposed to malicious hackers, it added. Cabinet Office Minister Ben Gummer said: No longer the stuff of spy thrillers and action movies, cyber attacks are a reality and they are happening now. Our adversaries are varied - organised criminal groups, ‘hactivists’, untrained teenagers and foreign states. The first duty of the Government is to keep the nation safe. Any modern state cannot remain secure and prosperous without securing itself in cyberspace. That is why we are taking the decisive action needed to protect our country, our economy and our citizens. We can be proud that the UK leads the world in cyber security."}

{"id":409,"title":"IBM and the WMG Cyber Security Centre launch cyber security module","class":0,"body":"To support businesses, governments and society deal with the ever increasing cost of cyber security breaches, the University of Warwick recently launched a Cyber Security Centre. The arm has partnered with IBM to deliver a module aimed at developing the technical and managerial skills to effectively design and implement strategies to mitigate and prevent today's and tomorrow’s cyber intrusions. The rise of highly connected digital technologies that carry a range of valuable, sensitive and/or private information, comes with associated risks – much of the infrastructure and software used to store and carry the information, is potentially insecure. As often is the case, commercial value lures criminal activity, and today cyber-criminal activity is estimated by McAfee to generate $400 billion in annual losses to the world economy, with little outlook of costs growth slowing in the near term. To counter the threat, cybercrime is increasingly on the radar of companies, governments and individuals. One of the main investment area is adding more talent, although the market is faced with scarcity. This year there were more than a million unfilled cyber security positions worldwide – this is expected to increase to 1.5 million by 2020, creating a quagmire for companies seeking to defend their boarders through a cost-post position, while in a tough market for talent. In a bid to develop tools and techniques to reduce the risks for governments, businesses and society bearing the brunt of attacks, the University of Warwick’s Cyber Security Centre (CSC) was formed. The centre performs research into developing the cyber defences of tomorrow for stakeholders as well as providing education programmes in cyber security and related disciplines. The CSC and IBM recently announced that they will work together to develop a master’s level module for cybersecurity related to defending businesses from intrusion, focused particularly on the perspective of an organisation's Chief Information Security Officer. The new module, which has been part of the MSc in Security and Management since May, is aimed at developing people who are looking to take up a leading technical or managerial role in an organisation critically dependent upon data and information communication technology. Additionally, the module is open to professionals seeking to bolster their skills in the area of cyber security alongside their work. Tim Watson, Director of the WMG Cyber Security Centre, says, Our approach to cyber security education is a multi-disciplinary one, combining academics, government and industry experts who bring together both the technical and behavioural aspects needed for transformative cyber security. We are delighted to be working with IBM to deliver this particular module, looking at cyber security from a complete organisational perspective. One of the developers of the new model is Mark Buckwell, Consulting and Systems Integration Practice Leader at IBM UK and Ireland. He adds, The Enterprise Cyber Security module was created to give students the opportunity to engage in architectural thinking in the design of enterprise IT security. By understanding how security is designed into core business practice, participants now have a vital kit bag of practical tools and techniques to apply in the workplace."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":410,"title":"U.S. MILITARY LAUNCHES CYBERATTACKS AGAINST ISIS","class":0,"body":"The U.S. Defense Department has announced plans to use cyberwarfare as part of its ongoing operations against the Islamic State militant group (ISIS). Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said in a briefing this week that cyberattacks will be used to assist Iraqi and Kurd forces to recapture the city of Mosul. It is the first time the U.S. military has openly revealed details of its electronic warfare efforts against ISIS. Cyberattacks are being used in Mosul to disrupt communications and critical infrastructure in the city, according to the briefing. Carter said the attacks aim to interrupt [ISIS’s] command and control, to cause them to lose confidence in their networks, to overload their networks so they can’t function, and to do all of these things that will interrupt their ability to command and control forces there, control the population and the economy. Much of the telecommunications infrastructure in Mosul and Iraq was put in place by the U.S. following the 2003 Iraq war, potentially making the job of hacking it easier. Carter did not give specific details about what methods would be used. He said: We don’t want the enemy to know when, where, and how we’re conducting cyber operations. We don’t want them to have information that will allow them to adapt over time. We want them to be surprised when we conduct cyber operations. ISIS has also signalled its intentions to target Western infrastructure, although so far attacks have been limited in scope. The so-called Caliphate Cyber Army (CCA) recently announced plans to take down Google but instead defaced the website of Add Google Online, a small Indian firm that offers search engine optimization (SEO) services to local businesses. Other attacks by the CCA include a small solar energy company in England, a Japanese dance instructor, and a laminate flooring firm based in Wales."}

{"id":412,"title":"US CyberCom is going to launch attacks against critical American infrastructure for an entire month","class":0,"body":"The US Cyber Command will conduct large-scale military exercises this week simulating cyber attacks against critical US infrastructure, and the war games will highlight the growing threat posed by foreign states capable of crippling the electrical grid and financial networks through digital attacks. The exercise, known as Cyber Guard 16, is the latest annual war game involving scores of military personnel and civilians at the Fort Meade-based command. Other players will include officials from the Pentagon, FBI, Homeland Security Department, and private industry. Cyber Guard offers a fascinating, realistic (but not predictive) scenario of a cyber attack of significant consequence on US critical infrastructure, Maj. Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of the command’s National Mission Force, said last week. Nakasone, whose mission team is tasked with defending military networks, also is in charge of the military unit that would be called in to counter and respond to a cyber attack on elements of critical infrastructure. The month-long exercise is an example of both interagency security cooperation as well as working with private sector stakeholders in dealing with cyber threats, he told Federal News Radio in an online chat. A command spokesman declined to provide details on the Cyber Guard exercise and referred questions to a fact sheet produce for last year’s version. The exercise ends June 29. Last year, 100 organizations from government, academia, industry, and allied nations took part at the Joint Staff Suffolk Complex, a high-security war-gaming facility in Suffolk, Va. The command’s cyber warfare game comes amid concerns that the federal government is not doing enough to protect the electrical grid, arguably the most critical of the 16 different elements of critical infrastructure, as most other elements require electricity to operate. Currently, the federal government is relying on a private consortium of companies that appears to be playing down threats to the power grid from cyber and other attacks. The non-profit North American Electric Reliability Corporation is the official organization designated by the federal government to be in charge of setting security standards for electrical networks. It is responsible for making sure electrical owners and operators of the bulk power system are taking the steps needed to protect the lattice of power companies stretching throughout the United States, Canada, and Baja California, Mexico. The private regulatory authority was given the task of setting grid security standards by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Testimony before the commission last week reveals that current industry standards for reporting cyber security incidents are allowing power companies to game the system to underreport potential attacks. In 2014, for example, the non-profit corporation reported only three cyber security incidents, and a draft of the forthcoming annual reliability report is said to report zero incidents. The consortium’s low numbers conflict sharply with those of the Department of Homeland Security’s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Readiness Team that monitors infrastructure cyber incidents. According to the DHS group, 46 cyber security incidents were reported in 2015, and 79 were reported the year before that. The department did not differentiate which energy sectors were involved in the cyber incidents but it is likely electric companies were among the targets in the numerous incidents. Incidents involving electricity companies have included hacks into smart meters to steal power, failure in control systems that forced power plants to shut down, and malicious software that disabled safety monitoring systems. Clearly there is a gap in [North American Electric Reliability Corporation] cyber security incident reporting; this gap should be addressed by more stringent FERC-mandated reporting standards, said Tom Popik with the Foundation for Resilient Society, a group that advocates for better grid security. In April, Cybercom commander Adm. Mike Rogers voiced doubts about whether the command could help the country from multiple cyber attacks against the electrical power grid. The danger was highlighted by the first known successful cyber attack against a nation’s power grid in December. Following the attack, which targeted Ukraine, the FBI in March began briefing American electric power companies on the threat to the US power grid. We have the skills. The challenge for us at the moment is one of capacity, Rogers said, noting a current shortage of skilled people could hamper efforts if we had multiple events simultaneously. Rogers noted that the electrical power industry and a couple of others in charge of critical infrastructure are resisting efforts to bolster cyber defenses since doing so would require rate increases. That seems to be one factor motivating the North American Electric Reliability Corporation to undercount in its reporting of cyber incidents. A congressional General Accountability Office report states that since 2011 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not been checking private electric companies to ensure they are complying with voluntary cyber security standards. The report recommended that the commission begin conducting periodic evaluations of security compliance. However, FERC has not implemented this recommendation, the GAO said in November. As they become increasingly reliant on computerized technologies, the electricity industry’s systems and networks are susceptible to an evolving array of cyber-based threats, the report said. The problem is not simply potential increased costs for cyber security by electric companies. Opposition within private industry to tightening cyber security of electric grid control networks also is the result of concerns over the large operational costs involved in shutting down power systems to hunt for and remove malicious software. The dangers to the nation’s electric security are too great and protecting the most critical of infrastructures is too important. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should require power companies to invest in better cyber security—before a major cyber attack turns out the lights."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":413,"title":"Why Now Is The Time To Establish A Standalone Cyber Force","class":0,"body":"Now that DoD recognizes cyberspace as an operating environment, it needs to seriously consider standing up an independent cyber force. Does America need a cyber force? On one side of the debate is retired Adm. James Stavridis who analogizes the requirement to have a separate entity capable of operating in cyberspace to the creation of the U.S. Air Force. To Stavridis, the growing importance of cyberspace in future conflict is clear and the need for a cyber force obvious, and America can speed up adoption by bypassing the 20-year debate that surrounded the creation of the Air Force. On the other side of the debate are the current heads of the Navy and Marine Corps, Adm. John Richardson and Gen. Robert Neller. Neither sees the need for a standalone cyber service. While the truth of the matter lies somewhere in the middle, it is probably closer to Stavridis’ point of view. In the wake of the official Defense Department recognition of cyberspace as an operating environment, it is time to seriously consider standing up an independent cyber force. Classic models of bureaucratic politics could have predicted these positions and without powerful advocates the likely outcome is no new force. A new cyber force would likely subsume current service cyber forces (e.g., Army Cyber Command, Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command). No service likes to lose resources and assets. Setting aside arguments rooted in bureaucratic infighting and jockeying, does the overall argument for an independent cyber service hold up? The main thrust of the pro-cyber force argument moves forward along two avenues: First, that cyberspace represents a distinct operating environment; and second, that in order to effectively operate in this domain, a separate and standardized set of skills needs to be developed, which are distinct from the sets of skills developed by existing services. In other words, warfare has changed so much that it necessitates a unified cyber capability. Widespread convergence of physical and virtual realities, or the ability of the physical to be controlled via the virtual, seems to confirm this notion. Add in the amount of value in the world that exists mostly at a virtual plane — such as the billions of dollars of market cap in companies like Facebook and the amount of capital that flows through the world’s banking systems that never existed as hard currency — and the notion of cyber being a separate domain seems uncontroversial. Manipulating matter in cyberspace, aside from physically destroying datastores and network communications lines, requires a skill set distinct from rifle marksmanship and driving an MRAP. The follow-on question from the domain question is whether the military needs a separate and unified cyber force to effectively fight in cyberspace? Both separate and unified are important to this argument because one could envision the status quo going forward where each service has its own force (non-unified) with coordination occurring through U.S. Cyber Command. The notion of separate traditions, doctrine, equipment, and organization is a major part of the argument forwarded by the anti-cyber force camp. One issue that always comes up when depicting cyber warriors is of an out-of-shape hacker who refuses to wear a uniform. While this seems to be a major preoccupation of the service chiefs (when asked about more lax physical and appearance standards, Neller refused to consider such possibilities), it doesn’t necessarily follow that these cyber warriors all would fit this mold. First, it is well established that exercise aids cognition. One need only look at exercise regimen of top video gamers and Silicon Valley programmers who are also obsessed with CrossFit to know that fitness and computing skill are not orthogonal concepts. Second, the entire argument about uniforms is a red herring designed to take attention away from the real issues. After all, what uniforms do special operations personnel wear while deployed? Clothes do not make people better at their job nor does it make them more professional. And if it really is a problem for recruits, they can always go and join the National Security Agency. Beyond resourcing issues, the Navy and Marine Corps chiefs stated that coordination and integration would be impeded if cyber warriors were in their own service. No doubt, integration and coordination are essential to proper employment of cyber capabilities. The interagency process is notorious for being an essential but ineffective part of Washington policy and war-making. However, this same line of argumentation, when taken to its logical conclusion, would also obviate the need for the entire Marine Corps because we already have the Army to fight on land and could also train the Army to do amphibious operations. A similar argument exists in favor of entirely subsuming the waterborne parts of the Marine Corps mission into the wider Navy. Coordination and integration are always hard, even within services. So, on its own, the coordination argument doesn’t hold much water. Further dissecting the opposition, the question remains whether or not the additional coordination burden and resource expenditure is justified in terms of additional warfighting capability created. In other words, will housing all cyber forces under one roof create a net benefit? One important benefit would be the creation of unified training and skill standards for offensive cyber and network defense capabilities. Others include common operational language and standard procedures, programming language fluency, and uniform equipment base. Best practices, exploitations, and vulnerabilities can be rapidly shared, which is of utmost importance in a domain where information perishability and competitive advantages appear and disappear in minutes and seconds rather than days and years. Ultimately the two sides are arguing past each other a bit. The issues regarding coordination are symptoms of long-recognized problems that arose with the last major reorganization of defense forces under the Goldwater-Nichols Act. By institutionalizing today’s current structure of regional combatant commands, the advisory function of the Joint Chiefs, and relegation of the services to the role of force provider, no service chiefs likely want to see further erosion of their responsibilities. In addition, the Goldwater-Nichols reorganization made sense in the age in which they were made, but today’s world demands an overarching coordinating body for whole-of-government defense strategies. Even basic questions such as which DoD entity is in charge of civil assistance in the case of a domestic cyber emergency remains unsettled, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report. Cyberspace, being everywhere (all pervasive), nowhere (owing to the replicability of data structures), and somewhere (servers and fiber exist in physical space), is not like the other domains. Organizations should adapt to environmental and technological changes or risk obsolescence. While the standup of a separate cyber force could be a massive waste of time and money without changes to the upstream command and control structure, it could also be a great net benefit to U.S. defense capabilities."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":414,"title":"IDF to Establish New Cyber Warfare Military Branch","class":0,"body":"IDF Chief Lt. Gen. Gadi Eizenkot recently announced the formation of a new branch of the IDF that will be dedicated to advancing the army’s cyber warfare efforts, administer cyber strategies, provide cross-military cyber services, and spearhead the cyber efforts of all military branches, including the three units already dedicating to cyber protection and counterattacks. This new branch, said Eizenkot, will be paramount to the IDF’s adaptation to the dynamic nature of modern warfare and the very real cyber threats and attacks that Israel undergoes daily. The new branch will join the IAF, Navy, and GOC Army Headquarters as a main service branch that will oversee the military’s cyberwarfare strategy. The cyber branch is currently headed by the military intelligence unit, in specific, the C4I corps. Eizenkot instructed Military Intelligence Director Maj. Gen. Herzl Halevi to form a special think tank to review the military’s cyber framework. Results showed that the continually developing and changing cyber warfare front requires its own section of the IDF to combat and formulate strategies on how to counter cyber attacks against Israel and Israeli targets. According to the IDF spokespersons unit, the new branch will take two years to become fully operational. The IDF is required to excel in every aspect of war, including the cyber dimension, which is becoming more significant every day. This new command will empower the IDF to perform better in these fronts and will utilize the technological and human advantage that already exists in Israel, said Eisenkot. The decision to formally open the cyber branch is pending the approval of Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, which is expected to be granted in the coming weeks. While the IDF said the new branch will be modeled after the structure of the IAF and Navy, it will be far more integrated than either of those two military branches. The cyber branch will be responsible for intelligence gathering, force building, and providing cross-military cyber services. While there is no current head of the branch, it is expected that in a similar fashion to all other GOC’s in the IDF, the head of the branch will be a Major-General. Additionally, it is currently under investigation as to whether to integrate the Teleprocessing branch of the IDF, which currently sits under the command of C4I corps, into the cyber branch. Should that plan come to fruition, the non-cyber activities of the Teleprocessing branch would be transferred elsewhere. One of the challenges that the new branch will face is to coordinate its activities with the national cyber command which falls under the auspices of the Prime Minister’s Office. The announcement of the new cyber command came just a day after the Israeli cybersecurity company ClearSky said it had uncovered a massive Iranian cyber attack against Israel. Hackers attacked 40 targets in Israel and 500 worldwide. Using classic techniques such as phishing – creating a false web page that imitates a real one to gather information – hackers targeted retired IDF generals, researchers in academia, and employees of various security firms. Israel has been the target of numerous cyber attacks in the past year since Operation Protective Edge last summer."}

According to Thai Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, Thailand will establish a new group to counter growing cyber threats. It’s to prevent new types of threats, it’s a preemptive measure, he said October 20 according to media reports. He did not elaborate on which specific threats he was referring to or what the exact mandate of the new unit would be. At a meeting a day earlier, General Sommai Kaotira, the supreme commander of the Royal Thai Armed Forces (RTAF), had said that the new unit would comprise all three armed forces as well as the Royal Thai Police. He added that the unit was part of a broader five-year roadmap in line with the plans of Thailand’s ruling junta which seized power in a coup last May. The move comes amid controversial plans by the ruling junta to create a single access point to the Internet. Opponents have labeled it the Great Firewall of Thailand – comparing it to a similar scheme in China – because it would tighten web surveillance and undermine free speech. Though Thai officials have recently said that the so-called single gateway plan would be scrapped, activists say it could always be revived unless a clear, formal commitment is made to abandon it. In response, some Internet freedom advocates have also threatened to wage cyber war against the government to make clear their discontent. For instance, local media outlets have reported that a group called Thailand F5 Cyber Army has been recruiting netizens through online courses aimed at temporarily shutting down government websites. What we’ve done so far is only symbolic. We want the government to realize the extent to which people are against the proposal, an unnamed team representative told The Bangkok Post.

{"id":416,"title":"UK Defence Intelligence to establish new cyber warfare unit","class":0,"body":"The UK is establishing a military unit dedicated to cyber and electromagnetic warfare, the chief of defence intelligence told an audience at the Ministry of Defence yesterday. Making a rare public appearance, Air Marshal Phil Osborn – the head of the Ministry’s Defence Intelligence arm – explained how his unit is investing some of the additional funds allocated to intelligence in last year’s Comprehensive Spending Review. The spending review saw the security and intelligence agencies’ budgets rise by 18% in real terms over its three-year term, and promised that the Single Intelligence Account (SIA) will also invest in a bigger and more capable global network and enhance its capability to fuse intelligence with the armed forces. The £1.9bn allocated to cyber capabilities represents an increase of 76% on spending during the 2010-15 Parliament – and some of this, Osborn explained, will fund the stand-up of a military joint cyber and electromagnetic group, run by Defence Intelligence and the Single Intelligence Account. The group, he said, will deliver deployable cyber support teams dealing with both offense and defence, helping both operators and planners, commanders and executors. Speaking to an invited audience at the Strand Group – a seminars series run by Kings College London’s Policy Institute – Osborn announced that Defence Intelligence is also creating a 24/7 situational awareness capability able to provide global monitoring and analysis across the spectrum. This will be costly, he conceded, but we put such stock on not being surprised that it’s worth the investment. The world is becoming more unpredictable, more competitive, more contested, more complex, more high-stakes, and as surprising and as demanding of intelligence as it’s ever been, he explained, pointing to major global events for which the West had not been fully prepared. We probably underplayed the scale and intensity of extremism. We probably underplayed the risk appetite of Russia, said Osborn. Most of us probably got the pressures that led to the Arab Spring correct, but we probably didn’t accurately predict the scale or velocity of subsequent events; and we didn’t pick up on the scale or velocity of the instability in Syria and elsewhere… Many of us thought [migration] would be a challenge for much of the world, but we didn’t pick up the confluence of factors that made it as immediate [a challenge] as it is today. Considering a range of possible future risks, the Defence Intelligence boss gave some generic examples of the kinds of things we should be thinking about. One more dangerous, less likely but still credible outcome, he suggested, was that of a powerful but declining state whose economy is tanking and has to do something different – something dramatically different – to arrest that decline. And perhaps whose sense of self and history, or risk appetite, or system governance makes that gamble make more sense. The future is made still less predictable, Osborn suggested, by the tendency of powerful heads of state to take national decisions on the basis of very personal motivations: If they’re deeply personal autocracies, how often are clashes between states actually conflicts between egos and the sense of self projected on a nation? You can probably imagine some of those today. The mystery of personality-based grand strategic decision-making will probably endure. A former RAF Tornado navigator and squadron commander, Osborn was made chief of defence intelligence a year ago and now leads 4,000 staff working on defence surveillance and reconnaissance, cyber and electromagnetic warfare, and defence counter-intelligence."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":417,"title":"PENTAGON SHOULD ESTABLISH FOURTH MILITARY SERVICE TO WAGE CYBERWARS","class":0,"body":"The United States, engaged in a cyberspace Cold War in which government networks are under constant attack, must establish a fourth military service to conduct cyberwarfare, according to an article in the most recent issue of a Defense newsletter. Defense Department computer networks are hit by cyberattacks hundreds of times a day, not only from adversaries, but also from nations that are supposed to be our 'friends,' according to an article in the spring issue of IANewsletter, published by the Defense Information Assurance Technology Analysis Center. The authors -- Col. John Buck Surdu, chief of staff at the Army Research Engineering and Development Command, and Lt. Col. Gregory Conti, assistant professor of Computer Science at the U.S. Military Academy -- did not identify the friendly nations that have attacked Defense networks. But the authors argued that Defense must establish a separate service for cyberwarfare because it is waged differently than traditional, or kinetic, warfare. The core missions of the Army, Navy and Air Force -- to conduct war on land, sea and air -- do not take into account the unique demands of cyberwarfare, according to Surdu and Conti. Cyberwarfare is fundamentally different from traditional kinetic warfare, the authors wrote. National boundaries in cyberspace are difficult, if not impossible, to define, they noted. Asymmetries abound, and defenders must block all possible avenues of a cyberattack. A lone but carefully crafted phishing e-mail sent to a senior official could compromise an entire network, they stated. Attackers can assault objectives from virtually any point on the planet, hopping through intermediate points to mask their trails. All three services maintain cyberwarfare components, with the Air Force taking the lead in the past few years trying to establish its own cyber command. But Surdu and Conti wrote that these [cyber] organizations exist as ill-fitting appendages that attempt to operate in inhospitable cultures where technical expertise is not recognized, cultivated or understood. . . . As a result, the Army, Navy and Air Force hemorrhage technical talent, leaving the nation's military forces and our country underprepared for both the ongoing cyber cold war and the likelihood of major cyberwarfare in the future. The three services misuse their cyber talent, they added, with the placement of a service's top wireless security expert in an unrelated assignment in the middle of nowhere . . . a Ph.D. whose mission was to prepare PowerPoint slides for a flag officer. The skill sets required to wage cyberwar differ greatly from those that elite Army Rangers possess, for example, and integrating small cyberwarfare units into existing armed forces is insufficient, Surdu and Conti wrote. A separate military service to conduct cyberwarfare must be established. Adding an efficient and effective cyber branch . . . would provide our nation with the capability to defend our technological infrastructure and conduct offensive operations. Surdu and Conti made a compelling case to establish a separate cyber service, said Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a nonprofit cybersecurity research group in Bethesda, Md. But the same result can be met, with greater benefits, by creating a Joint Cyber Command that is either on par with the U.S Strategic Command or as a subcommand. Paller said Defense is likely planning such a command. But Steven Aftergood, director of the government secrecy project at the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists, said, Though I understand the need for robust computer security and for defense against malicious interference with information systems, I'm not sold on cyberwar as a separate discipline. Aftergood said Defense is losing skilled cyber warriors from all three services, creating a serious problem. But I don't know how to fix it, he added. Bernie Skoch, a retired Air Force general who spent his career in the command, control, communications and information systems fields, also warned against separating cyberwarfare from kinetic warfare, saying it could cripple effects-based campaigns, which combine traditional warfare with nonmilitary initiatives that include diplomacy, propaganda and cyberwarfare. Skoch, who is a consultant with Suss Consulting in Jenkinstown, Pa., said that to achieve a military goal it will likely require a combination of cyber- and kinetic attacks, and strategic and tactical commanders need both in their arsenal."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":418,"title":"NATO cyberwar challenge: Establish rules of engagement","class":0,"body":"Tallinn, Estonia (CNN)In a red brick building on a 19th-century Russian czarist military compound in Tallinn, Estonia, a team of cyber experts is analyzing the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and how a Western democracy can legally respond. Inside, the building is cutting-edge high-tech. These military officers, lawyers and cyber techies are part of NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, carrying out research, training and exercises. One of their biggest challenges: When it comes to cyber -- so far -- there is no agreed-upon international law of war. The international community is extraordinarily interested in this, said Michael N. Schmitt, chairman of the US Naval War College's international law department. They're struggling with questions like, when the Russians hack into the DNC database and then release it, is that a violation of international law? What doors does that open with respect to our responses? Three years ago, Schmitt and his team at the NATO Cyber Centre wrote the book -- literally -- on international law and the use of cyber in warfare, the Tallinn Manual. Applying principles of the international law of war, they provided answers to questions like: In war, how can you use cyber and how can you not use it? If you operate against civilians, is that prohibited? They're now completing the Tallinn Manual 2.0, examining how international law applies to cyber attacks that don't cross the line into armed conflict by one state against another or by a terrorist group that kills civilians -- what's called below the threshold operations. The DNC hacks and the release of emails are below the threshold operations and, although Russia denies it did the hacking, the US government has been extraordinarily clear in accusing Moscow, citing 17 US government agencies that have concluded Russia was behind it. This, in my opinion, has reached a specific threshold in the audacity and impact of the attack, said the Cyber Defence Centre's Strategy Branch Chief Matthijs Veenendaal, a Dutch citizen. This is still very much an attack on civilian infrastructure and government infrastructures and not an armed attack. If that's the case, did Russia violate international law? Schmitt has no doubt. In my mind, it is crystal clear that the Russians have violated international law in this particular case. But here is where it gets less clear: Schmitt and other experts say Russia and cyber-savvy countries like China are playing the margins. They're operating within the space where there is some degree of uncertainty, he explained. If Russia had destroyed America's cyber infrastructure, that would be a use of force and hence a violation. If Russia is simply engaging in low-level espionage, that's a violation of domestic US law, but probably not a violation of international law. Schmitt, however, called the DNC hack a prohibited intervention into the internal affairs of the United States, affairs that include running elections, and that means it is a violation of international law. It may also be a violation of US sovereignty, he said. If Russia is simply exfiltrating data, or stealing it but not doing anything with it, that's not a violation, but if there is proof it is using data and manipulating election results, that would be a violation. As Schmitt sees it, the DNC hacks are not a game-changer, but a major disruption of the US economy would be. My personal view is that would constitute moving over the threshold and allow us to take off the gloves. But, he added, that view is not universally held. Vice President Joe Biden has indicated the US will retaliate against the hack of the DNC and other Democratic Party entities, warning that the administration will be sending a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin, he said, will know it, and it will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact. But under international law, does President Barack Obama have the legal right to retaliate? Schmitt of the Naval War College maintains that Obama unambiguously does have the right to respond, but Schmitt would not use the term retaliate. In international law, we don't do tit for tat, he said. What we may do is engage in what is called -- and this is a legal term -- 'counter measures.'  Counter-measures are operations that would otherwise be unlawful but can be used if the purpose is to stop another state from violating the law. So the US could hack back against the Russians? The answer is yes, Schmitt said, as long as Washington reasonably believes Moscow is going to continue to hack it. Counter-measures don't have to be cyber-related. The US, for example, could prevent Russian ships from transiting its territorial waters until Russia stops its cyber breaches. The response, however, must be proportionate. Shutting down a Russian electric grid would only be permissible if it didn't cause more harm to Russia than its hacking caused the US -- a tricky thing to measure. As the US considers itself a law-abiding country, it most often tries to follow accepted international law of war principles. It could, however, ignore those internationally accepted principles or interpret them in its favor. I know some in America have called for that (retaliation), and I can see where the urge comes from, because you want Russia to stop it, said the Cyber Defence Centre's Veenendaal, but going on a path of escalation with the Russians is a recipe for disaster. Responding to an escalation with your own escalation will lead to further escalation, which -- in cyber space -- is extremely hard to contain and monitor, especially for Western democracies, he warned. The cyber world presents unique challenges, like the ability for actors to maintain plausible deniability, which makes it devilishly hard to define who is behind an attack. You can always just plausibly state that this was just a 19-year-old hacker working in someone's basement in Belarus, said Kadri Kaska, an Estonian researcher at the NATO center. Pointing the finger at the perpetrators -- attribution -- also is not that simple. If an intelligence agency says it knows who did it, it could be challenged to reveal sources and methods of how it collects intelligence data. Probably in the (US) National Security Agency there are a lot of discussions ongoing, like, 'How far should we go in publicly attributing these attacks to these guys in St. Petersburg? We know who their girlfriends are, we know who they talk to. We're deep in their systems, we're deep in any Russian system you can think of. And we want to stay there,'  according to Veenendaal. The US has responded to hacks by China by naming and shaming specific officials in the Chinese military whom it holds responsible for attacks, then entering discussions with Beijing to deter further economic espionage. But against the Russians, he said, no, we haven't been effective. Veenendaal and other cyber experts say the Chinese, in an effort not to jeopardize their economic relations with the US, have quietly pulled back some of their hacking. With Russia, however, there is little economic incentive. In July, NATO included cyber as a domain of its military operations, along with land, sea, air and space. That means if there is an armed attack through cyberspace, NATO members can call on their allies for collective defense. But intrusions, like the DNC hacks, that fall short of armed attacks still lie in a gray zone, exploited by nations clever enough not to cross the line that would trigger an armed response. They are the cyber equivalent of the little green men that Russia used in Crimea: Russian armed forces without insignia whose existence Putin, at first, denied. The West, so far, has no common strategy to deter little green hackers. The DNC hacks may be their first major operation against the US, but they almost surely won't be their last."}

{"id":421,"title":"Chinese military launches two new wings for space and cyber age","class":0,"body":"China has officially launched two new wings of the military and established a separate command for ground units as it presses on with a massive overhaul of the armed forces. The Central Military Commission also released a guideline on Friday aimed a driving the rest of the reform programme. At an inauguration ceremony in Beijing on Thursday, President Xi Jinping conferred flags on the new PLA Rocket Force and PLA Strategic Support Force, as well as the general command for the Army of the People’s Liberation Army. The Rocket Force is founded on what was the Second Artillery Corps – the PLA’s strategic missile force – and will take charge of missiles and rockets, according to a source close to the army. The Strategic Support Force would be responsible for hi-tech warfare in space and on the internet, the source said. Defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said on Friday that the creation of the rocket force was consistent with China’s nuclear policy and strategy. Xi said the inauguration of the commands of the three forces was a strategic step to establish a modern military system with Chinese characteristics. In its guideline, the CMC said the defence system would be restructured to build a modern military for the information age by 2020, with most of the reforms expected to be completed by the end of this year. It follows sweeping changes to the military’s leadership and command system last year. Once the changes are in place the CMC will take direct charge of administering all military wings, including the PLA, the People’s Armed Police, and the militia and reserve forces. Under the plan, four main vertical chains – command, development, administration and supervision – will be better defined with clear lines for decision-making, planning, implementing plans and evaluating processes. The five battle zone commands, which replace seven military regions, will focus on combat, and each of the various military services will pursue their own development. The departments of General Staff, Political, Logistics, and Armaments – or the so-called four general departments of the CMC – would be devolved into various departments to streamline the organisation. The guideline also calls for the creation an integrated command system that can operate in both war and peace time. The main changes to the composition of the armed forces, military academies and colleges, and armed police will be completed by the end of this year. The militias will also be trimmed and reorganized. More adjustments and improvements will be rolled out gradually from 2017 to 2020, as conditions allow, according to the guideline. At the inauguration ceremony, Xi urged the army to adapt to the digital age, explore new approaches in land warfare and transform itself into a powerful modern land force. He told the Rocket Force to improve nuclear deterrence and counterstrike capacity and advance its medium- and long-range precision strike ability. He called on the Strategic Support Force to leapfrog developments in key fields."}

To expedite critical technologies to the field, the U.S. Army created a Rapid Capabilities Office and will conduct rapid materiel development and delivery efforts to address immediate, near-term, and mid-term Combatant Commanders' needs. This office is vitally important to the Army's acquisition reform efforts, but at the same time, it's not a substitute for the acquisition practice, says Katrina McFarland, the Army acquisition executive. The goal of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office is not to procure systems to outfit the entire Army, but rather to use targeted investments to execute strategic prototyping, concept evaluation and limited equipping -- especially in areas where technology progresses rapidly. It will help commanders and soldiers in the field today, while building an advantage for those who will follow in their footsteps. Officials say the office will also focus on rapid prototyping and initial equipping of capabilities in the areas of cyber, electronic warfare, navigation and timing, survivability and positioning, as well as other project areas. The intent is to deliver an operational effect within one to five years. Secretary of the Army Eric K. Fanning, who headed the establishment of the office, states, We're serious about keeping our edge, so we need to make changes in how we get soldiers the technology they need. The Army Rapid Capabilities Office is a major step forward, allowing us to prioritize cross-domain, integrated capabilities in order to confront emerging threats and advance America's military dominance. The office aims to provide holistic solutions that inform on the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, facilities and policy, as well as the impact of implementing new capabilities within the Army. It will also leverage other government agencies and industry innovations, including warfighter feedback, to deliver solutions within a faster timeline. Rapid Capabilities Office Director Douglas K.

{"id":423,"title":"McCain to White House: If You Won’t Establish a Cyber Defense Policy, Congress Will","class":0,"body":"‘Ignoring the issue, as the White House has done, is not an option,’ said the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman on Tuesday. The federal government, including the Defense Department, needs a clearer plan about how to respond to attacks on civilian systems, members of the Senate Armed Services Committee argued Tuesday. Sen. John McCain, R.-Ariz., suggested drafting a policy about what the United States’ actions would be in the case of a threat, in the case of an actual attack, he said during a hearing on encryption and cybersecurity. If you don’t act, I guarantee you Congress will act, he said, addressing witnesses Adm. Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, and Marcell Lettre, undersecretary of defense for intelligence. The hearing illustrated disagreements between members of Congress, senior cyber officials and private technology companies about the best way to cooperate on preventing not only future cyberattacks, but physical attacks planned using encrypted communication such as WhatsApp. In response to McCain’s suggestion, Lettre argued during the hearing that new legal and regulatory approaches are not as potentially productive as robust conversations between the public and private sectors. Lettre said the public and private sectors are often able to cooperate if on the government side, we’re able to communicate the problems we’re trying to solve, and ask for industry’s best expertise and wisdom about solutions. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., noted that so far there have been limits to that strategy, as Twitter has still been reluctant to share access to its so called firehose of data. Right now, we’ve had mixed reviews of the opportunity to work collaboratively with the private sector, she said. Senators seemed stumped by Twitter’s refusal to share access to its analytics service Dataminr with intelligence agencies. Shame on them, McCain said, asking witnesses what could be done other than exposing [Twitter] for what they are. The United States must balance our national security needs and the rights of our citizens, McCain said, though he added the U.S. must recognize that authoritarian governments may search for keys to suppressing dissents and monitor their own citizens. Yet, ignoring the issue, as the White House has done, is not an option, he said. Asked what new technology could change domestic cyber response, Rogers explained his team is especially interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. How do we do cyber at scale, at speed, he said, noting that focusing purely on hiring more cyber talent instead of investing in more advanced technology will be both incredibly resource intensive and it will be very slow. Rogers said he was especially worried hackers might become less interested in extracting U.S. data for their own purposes, and more on manipulating information so it can’t be trusted. For instance, if military commanders can’t trust the tactical maps they have, they can’t effectively make decisions, he explained. What happens when nonstate actors decide that the internet is not just a forum to coordinate … but instead offers the opportunity to act as a weapons system? he asked."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":424,"title":"New Navy command established in Suffolk","class":0,"body":"Adm. Philip Davidson, commander of the Navy's Fleet Forces, spoke of the Battle of Midway, a pivotal U.S. win during World War II, when trying to convey the importance of the newly formed Information Dominance Forces Command. Against a superior and unbeaten foe, and still reeling from the attack at Pearl Harbor, U.S. code breakers intercepted a Japanese plan to attack Midway, a U.S.-occupied island, which the Japanese had designated AF. To ensure it had decrypted the target correctly, the Navy sent an open message saying Midway was experiencing a water shortage, and then monitored Japanese radio traffic relaying that the target, AF, was short of water. Identifying Midway as the target allowed the U.S. to send reinforcements that surprised and defeated the Japanese attack group. This strategic output was enabled because of the operational reach and the imagination and capabilities inherit in information dominance, Davidson said Wednesday at a ceremony officially establishing the Navy Information Dominance Forces Command in Suffolk. Most of the crowd at the Department of Defense compound knew the story well — encryption 101, Davidson called it. But it reiterated his point that this new command represents the next evolution in the Navy's effort to keep the fleet ready to fight and win. That is why, Davidson said, the new command is located near the fleet. Davidson's command is headquartered at Naval Station Norfolk. Our operational reach is not just limited to the physical domain. Our ships' tactical reach isn't limited by the height of eye any more. Our information dominance warriors have extended the reach of our fleet once again, Davidson said. We have new advantage. Rear Adm. Matthew Kohler is leading the command, which is responsible for manning, equipping and training the sailors who gather information and intelligence from the ocean, weather, space and more recently, cyberspace. It consolidates administrative control of Navy Cyber Forces Command, Fleet Cyber Command, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command, and the Office of Naval Intelligence under one supervisory command. From North Korea's cyber attack on Sony or Islamic State supporters hacking military and local government websites like Isle of Wight, to fixing an antenna on an aircraft carrier, this command ensures sailor have the tools and skills they need to respond. It is not an operational command, rather the Information Dominance Command oversees force readiness. It is what the military refers to as a type command. Type commands are usually set up around platforms – ships, submarines, and aircraft, Kohler said. The Information Dominance Type Command is unique in that it is formed around a capability. Type commands drive the business of the Navy as force generating organizations ensuring that the Navy's war fighting forces are ready for the full scope of their missions. Type commands ensure our forces are properly manned with the appropriate numbers of personnel that they have the skills needed to do the job and are trained with the latest tactics, techniques and procedures and equipped with the best tools that the Navy and technology can buy. Since 2009, the Navy has made a series of organizational changes all related to the development and advancement of the Navy's newest fighting discipline of information dominance, Kohler said. He called it a cyber awakening. While officially established Wednesday, the command was created in October. Kohler said it has already worked to improved cyber security through dozens of efforts both ashore and afloat and is working to identify, prioritize and fix problems with Navy intelligence systems. Suffolk Mayor Linda Johnson said it was a dark day in 2010 when the Joint Forces Command left the area, taking with it some 5,000 jobs. The new command brought about 700 military, civilian and contracting jobs back. We were worried about our military, Johnson said. We were worried about our future. This is going to be our future. It says so much about our region."}

You can’t just say come because we’re cool — you have to be cool by offering enticing careers in cyber and technology, said astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. Do that, and you’ll get them, for sure, Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, told the Defense Innovation Board. Tyson spoke at the Pentagon at the board’s first public session earlier this week. The board was set up last March by Defense Secretary Ashton Carter to bring Silicon Valley expertise and new ways of addressing complex problems to the military. Chaired by Alphabet Inc. Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, the board heard a number of preliminary recommendations, including one for a Digital ROTC, or Reserve Officer Training Corps. Board member Marne Levine, chief operating officer of Instagram, said the Defense Department should consider offering tuition payments for students who commit to joining a Digital ROTC to pursue high-tech positions in the military. Students in those programs would focus on cyber operations and cyber defense. The Digital ROTC would be one way for the Defense Department to compete with the private sector for cyber talent, Levine said. We are blessed with an extraordinary pool of talent, but even we cannot meet all of the demands of technical expertise, she said. In July, Carter described the Defense Innovation Board as a tool to keep the Defense Department imbued with a culture of innovation in people, organizations, operations, and technology, to support people who innovate — those creative figures in our department who are willing to try new things, fail fast, and iterate, and also to ensure that we’re always doing everything we can to stay ahead of potential adversaries. In addition to Schmidt, Levine and Tyson, board members include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; retired Navy Adm. William McRaven, University of Texas Chancellor and former commander of Special Operations Command; Aspen Institute President and Chief Executive Walter Isaacson; Amazon founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos; and Code for America’s Founder and Executive Director Jennifer Pahlka.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has appealed to Britain's top IT experts to join up and work as military reservists. The MoD wants to recruit hundreds of part-time specialists across the Armed Forces to help boost Britain's efforts to block cyber assaults and even to strike in cyber space. The Joint Cyber Reserve Unit will work alongside regular forces to protect critical computer networks and safeguard vital data. Regular personnel leaving the Armed Forces, and current and former reservists with the necessary skills, are invited to apply along with civilians.Recruitment starts next month. The MoD said it will recognise the unique attributes of individuals who might otherwise not be attracted to, or able to serve in the reserve forces. Mr Hammond said: In response to the growing cyber threat, we are developing a full-spectrum military cyber capability, including a strike capability, to enhance the UK's range of military capabilities. Increasingly, our defence budget is being invested in high-end capabilities such as cyber and intelligence and surveillance assets to ensure we can keep the country safe. The cyber reserves will be an essential part of ensuring we defend our national security in cyber space. This is an exciting opportunity for internet experts in industry to put their skills to good use for the nation, protecting our vital computer systems and capabilities. Anyone applying would be subject to security vetting, officials pointed out, as well as citizenship and residency requirements and a commitment to take part in at least a minimum level of annual training. Last July, a group of MPs said the threat of a cyber assault on Britain is considered so serious it is marked as a higher threat than a nuclear attack. Despite being the preferred target of online criminals in 25 countries, the UK is still complacent towards cybercrime as victims are hidden in cyberspace, according to the Home Affairs Select Committee. The group of MPs said funding and resources for tackling online crime, which includes identity theft, industrial espionage, credit card fraud and child exploitation, has not been sufficiently allocated. The committee heard that the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau had discovered about 25 countries predominantly targeting the UK and said it was deeply concerned that EU partner countries are not doing enough to prevent the attacks. Online crime - committed by lone hackers, activist groups and nation states sponsoring industrial espionage - has been estimated by online security firm Norton to globally cost around £250bn ($388bn) in financial losses."}

{"id":431,"title":"Ministry of Defence steps up cyber security operations","class":0,"body":"The Ministry of Defence is to spend £40m building a new cyber defence operations centre to improve its protection from digital attacks. Cyber spies and criminals, intent on gaining access to sensitive military secrets and a mine of lucrative intellectual property, have made the MoD one of the most targeted organisations in the world. The British defence network — the single largest computer network in Europe — is hit by hundreds, sometimes thousands, of serious penetration attempts every day. Defending it is currently the responsibility of the MoD’s Information Systems and Services branch, based at the Corsham military base in Wiltshire — the armed forces’ communications hub. The new cyber security operations centre is also expected to be based at Corsham, following a recommendation from military planners. It will utilise state-of-the-art defensive cyber capabilities to protect the MoD’s cyber space from malicious actors, the ministry said in a statement. The military’s cyber defence facilities at Corsham underwent a £700m upgrade in 2011 to overhaul the MoD’s communications security. ISS already has hundreds of military personnel working at the site, although the exact number is classified because it might indicate the scale of the MoD’s defensive — and offensive — capabilities online. Britain is a world leader in cyber security but with growing threats this new operations centre will ensure that our armed forces continue to operate securely, said Michael Fallon, the defence secretary. Our increasing defence budget means that we can stay ahead of our adversaries in cyber space while also investing in conventional capabilities. Cyber security was identified as a key priority for the government in the Strategic Defence and Security Review in November. As well as increasing the budget available to the electronic intelligence and surveillance agency GCHQ, the government said it was allocating £1.9bn during the next five years to shore up defences online and develop sovereign capabilities in cyber space. In an interview with the Financial Times last June, Brigadier Alan Hill, the head of the MoD’s cyber defence operations, said the military’s digital capabilities would benefit from continued investment at scale for years to come. I have a lot of cutting-edge capability, he said. The MoD’s cutting edge was in using big data analytics to sift through the millions of incidents on its network that sensors pick up, he added. We have to have automated … and really slick processes to find the needle in the haystack … I am corralling this big virtual bucket of stuff which we are then using analytics to run through. You cannot take your eye off the volume because you only need one piece in that noise to [make a] successful [attack]. Britain is also one of the few countries internationally to have avowed an offensive digital capability. In 2013 it became the first country to do so, when Philip Hammond, then defence secretary, said the MoD and GCHQ had built a full-spectrum military cyber capability, including a strike capability. Defending British interests has proved a thornier issue, however. While the government has allocated significant funds to shoring up its own networks, success in persuading businesses and non-government organisations to do so has been more patchy.

Someday that will come. I think that’s just a logical progression, said Gen. John Hyten, the leader of Air Force Space Command. But Hyten said that despite having responsibility for the cyber domain, the command should remember that cyber is integrated in all war-fighting operations. My own personal perspective is that I have actually a little bit of a challenge with a command that is only focused on a single domain, Hyten said Tuesday at the annual Association of Old Crows symposium in Washington, D.C. The Washington Post is reporting that the Chinese military scaled back its cyber theft of U.S. commercial secrets in the wake of Justice Department indictments of five officers, and the surprising drawdown shows that the law enforcement action had a more significant impact than is commonly assumed, current and former U.S. officials said.

However, a security specialist anonymously warned that the country could have acted too late and is putting its eggs into one basket. Countries are slowly waking up to the fact that cyber threats are nearly as important as nuclear ones, the source told Techeye. Unlike unleashing nuclear weapons, hackers can easily strike, bringing down important government sites or stealing information, the source said.  Germany is on the right tracks with its new unit but it’s trailing behind the likes of the US and UK, which seemed to have their own departments up and running a while back. The main nature of this unit is to ward off the threats from China, but countries need to realise that it’s not just this behemoth that is likely to attack, the source said. If they really want to ensure they are safe they should look at countries with a political vengeance against them – after all, it’s not just China that’s at war with the world."}

(AFP PHOTO / POOL / JUNG YEON-JE) SEOUL - The South Korean military plans to set up a new team in charge of cyber operations in January under the wing of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Yonhap News Agency reported Tuesday citing military officials. The Cyber Tactics Department will be established under the JCS in January to serve as a control tower of military cyber operations, a military official was quoted as saying. The JCS chief will control and command all military operations in the cyberspace, the official said. It came as part of efforts to change cyber operation from defensive to proactive and preventive. Another military official was quoted as saying that the military is seeing cyber warfare as becoming real, noting that it needs to preemptively detect and destroy cyber attacks from a certain country or unspecified forces. The Military Cyber Command, a separate cyber warfare unit under the Army, reportedly plans to increase human resources from the current 600 to 1,000, while developing the cyber weapon system for both attack and defense. The military would boost cyber cooperation with the U.S. forces, planning to conduct the tabletop exercise (TTX) in around February next year for the enhancing of its cyber warfare capability."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":435,"title":" Service Chiefs Reject Proposal to Develop New Military Cyber Force ","class":0,"body":" Former NATO commander and retired Navy admiral James Stavridis speaks often of his proposal to develop a fifth U.S. military service branch -- a cyber force that would own operations in the virtual domain. But comments last week from Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson and Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller indicate the time has not come for that idea just yet. Speaking at a San Diego panel moderated by Stavridis on Feb. 19, Richardson and Neller both declined to offer support for such a cyber force when pressed on the topic. I think that this must be integrated. I think if we have a completely standalone type of thing, it's just going to be much more difficult to integrate it into operations, into planning and execution, debriefing, all of that, Richardson said. So while there are potentially some unique skill sets and capabilities, it's through that deep integration into the fundamentals, the basic ingredients of warfare going forward that I think is going to make cyber achieve its full potential. Neller, who has promised to expand the Marine Corps' cyber capabilities by the end of next year, allowed that more discussion was needed on the topic, but concluded that the current system worked well. Adm. Richardson is correct; it's a very integrated team, Neller said. Now, will [U.S. Cyber Command] no longer be a sub-unified command? Will it be a separate component? That's probably going to be something that's going to come out in [future] discussions ... right now I think we're in a good place but we have to grow our capability in support of the integrated joint cyber force. Stavridis said the responses from the two services chiefs to his idea of a cyber military branch were an indicator that the conversation about cyber is really just beginning. I have not advocated for the immediate establishment of a cyber force but that now is the time to have a conversation about it. And I will make the point that if you go back a hundred years ago, the analogy would be the Air Force, Stavridis said. Today I don't think we could imagine our military without an Air Force. I suspect in 50 to 100 years we will say of course we need a cyber force. Currently the U.S. military cyber presence consists of Cyber Command, which falls under U.S. Strategic command and is led by Navy Adm. Mike Rogers, and individual cyber commands organized within each of the military service branches. During the AFCEA West Conference held last week in San Diego, Marine Corps and Navy leaders emphasized the importance of developing better cyber practices and addressing serious vulnerabilities that exist within military networks. But Stavridis' proposals on future cyber warfare found opposition on more than one front. In a January article for the U.S. Naval Institute's Proceedings Magazine, Stavridis wrote that a dedicated cyber military branch would be be smaller in size than the Marine Corps with comparatively low physical-fitness standards and noticeably relaxed grooming standards ... the uniform of the day might resemble that of a conservatively dressed Googler. Asked about the possibility of relaxed physical or appearance standards for his cyber warriors, Neller did not budge. He said, They will be Marines."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":436,"title":" Army creating cyber units with soldiers, civilians ","class":0,"body":" YOKOTA AIR BASE, Japan — The Army is looking for soldiers and civilians to serve in new cyber units charged with protecting critical stateside infrastructure and creating effects on the battlefield in support of conventional forces. The challenge: Attracting the creative, energetic talent typically drawn to the freewheeling tech sector. Army Cyber Command has about 20 teams in place, out of the 41 that it hopes to form by the end of next year, said Command Sgt. Maj. Rodney Harris, an adviser to Army Cyber Command and its commander, Lt. Gen. Edward C. Cardon. Cyber protection teams harden key networks, mitigate risk and hunt for intruders. Other teams protect critical infrastructure, support commanders on the battlefield, analyze intelligence and develop software, Harris said. Recruiters are hoping to tap into some of the energy that has helped Silicon Valley lead the world in information technology. However, it’s unclear whether the Army can provide an environment compatible with the techies whose skills have made Google, Microsoft and Apple household names. A different sort of soldier will need to be recruited to fight in a seriously nontraditional space, said Arizona State University engineering professor Braden Allenby. The challenge for recruiters is twofold. They need to attract skilled techies to the military, then make sure they don’t trigger an immune response from the more traditional military organizations they need to work with, Allenby said. The Army has been building its cyber force since 2010, and Harris said the goal is to recruit 1,899 cyber workers – its share of 6,000 employees under the umbrella of the Defense Department’s Cyber Command. The Army’s cyber teams are scheduled to be fully staffed by the end of next year, though it will take longer to complete training, said Capt. Micah Bushouse, who works for Army Cyber Command’s advanced concepts and technology section. Bushouse, whose job is to ensure cyber soldiers have the funding and gear they need, has a telecommunications degree from Michigan State University and spent nine years as a signal officer before joining Army Cyber Command. Defending the network is a full-time job, but it’s very rewarding when it’s done correctly, he said. Cyberspace encompasses all of the networks and devices that hold data, Harris said. It is impossible to defend the entire network, he said. Commanders have to decide what pieces of the network are most important to them for a specific operation. Cyber soldiers can also go on the offensive. The effects they can create on the battlefield are akin to indirect fire such as artillery and mortars, Harris said. Cyber effects can, for example, deny an adversary the ability to use their electronic command and control systems, or block them from using the Internet, said Bill Roach, an Army Cyber Command public affairs officer. In June, cyber soldiers tested their skills alongside personnel from other branches of the military and government during Cyber Guard, an exercise that included attacks to disrupt electrical power on both U.S. coasts, said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Kevin E. Lunday, Cyber Command’s director of exercises and training. Under the scenario, oil and gas pipelines were disrupted, and bank and Defense Department information networks were attacked. The training involved responding to power outages, ATM failures, food shortages and other situations that might occur in such an attack, including the intense media interest that would result, Lunday said. We’re employing the force while we’re building it, he said. So some of the teams that were in this exercise are still under development — (they are) still being staffed and trained. Lava lamps, foosball Army Cyber Command is based temporarily at Fort Belvoir, Va., along with Army Intelligence and Security Command. A permanent facility will open at Fort Gordon, Ga., in 2019, Harris said. When we went to design the headquarters, we sent folks to Google and Microsoft to take away some lessons about design of the workplace, he said. Google’s Mountain View, Calif., corporate offices – dubbed the Googleplex – feature a cafeteria with free all-you-can-eat lobster, a giant dinosaur statue, a SpaceShipOne replica and plenty of lava lamps. There are also billiard, table-tennis and foosball tables. Roach said there likely won’t be free lobster or a giant dinosaur at the new cyber headquarters, and there aren’t as many exercise balls at Fort Belvoir as there were in The Internship, a 2013 film that lampoons Google’s work environment. But there are plenty of white boards, said Bushouse, who understands a lot of what cyber personnel scrawl on the boards but not everything. A lot of what goes on them is very technical, he said. To attract the right workforce, Army Cyber Command is still trying to figure out the best culture for its workplace. If we don’t acknowledge these capabilities that the civilians and even the soldiers bring to the workplace, they are going to go somewhere else where they are going to have that sort of environment, he said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":437,"title":" It's (Finally) Official: China Creates Cyberwarfare Military Branch","class":0,"body":" hina has long been rumored to possess cyberwarfare capabilities, and now the country's military has kicked off 2016 by creating a new military branch focused on the digital battleground. China's Central Military Council announced on Jan 1 that it has created three new military forces; one of these, according to the council's website, deals with what it calls 'cyber war forces.' The new forces include the General Command for the People's Liberation Army (a central command for ground forces), the Rocket Force and the Strategic Support Force. During the ceremony for the new forces in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping passed the flags to the units. Song said this new force is mainly aimed at providing resources capable of protecting China's cyber and space security, an article on the Chinese Defense Ministry website said. President Xi Jinping also emphasized the new force's adherence to China's current ideological rhetoric of the Chinese dream. The creation of the general command, rocket force and strategic support force is very important for the implementation of the Chinese dream about strengthening the army in light of the current situation. This a strategic measure to create a modern military system, taking into consideration the specificity of China, Xi said, as quoted in the statement. According to the statement, the aim of creating new units was to enhance the preparedness of the Chinese army. The People's Liberation Army is the biggest army in the world with a strength of more than two million military personnel. Beijing also possesses nuclear weapons and an aircraft carrier; a second one is under construction. These factors make the Chinese army one of the strongest and best-equipped in the world. China conducted a test in October of a new missile capable of destroying US satellites. The Dong Neng-3 exoatmospheric vehicle test is the eighth anti-satellite missile test China has conducted, according to a US congressional report."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":438,"title":" DOD's long path to creating a cyber warrior workforce ","class":0,"body":" When most all military officials talk about the cyber domain, they don’t focus so much on profound technological advancements and cutting-edge capabilities, but, rather, on the people. The Defense Department created U.S. Cyber Command in 2009 as a sub-unified service under the Strategic Command as a means of better enabling cyber operations. Within this structure, the force sought to build a Cyber Mission Force to fill the ranks in a variety of capacities as they relate to operations in cyberspace. The goal is to fill 133 teams consisting of 6,200 personnel with an operational capacity by 2018. By the end of 2016, all the teams will be in place and at initial operating capability. And by the end of 2018, we expect all those teams to be at full operational capability, Air Force Lt. Gen. James McLaughlin, deputy commander of Cyber Command, told an audience at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in October. The 133 teams will consist of 68 cyber protection teams focused on DOD’s number one mission— defense of the network—13 national mission teams to help defend the nation’s critical infrastructure, 27 combat mission teams aligned with the combatant commanders and assist in their planning, and 25 support teams that can be called upon, with another 2,000 service members in the reserves. 2016 will also be a big year from us because it’s an inflection point for us, Adm. Michael Rogers, commander of Cyber Command, told and audience at the Atlantic Council in January. The first few years of the organization’s short five-year history was spent on generating capacity and capability with the cyber mission force, he said. In 2016, as I tell our team, you can tell we’re at the tipping point now. The capacity and capability is starting to come online. You look at some of the things we’ve done on the defensive side, you look at some of the things that we’re doing looking in terms of a broader spectrum of capability, and the hard work of the last few years is really starting to pay off. Building the force We’re about half way through that build process right now. We have got to get it finished by September the 30th of 2018, is our goal, Rogers told an audience at the RSA conference this week. When I look at the data—and I review this every quarter, I just looked at the data about two weeks ago—we’re right now postulating that if nothing changes, 93 percent of the force will be delivered on time. So I’ve got to figure out in the next two years how we’re going to get that remaining seven percent on time. Because the goal is 100 percent of those 6,200 individuals and 133 teams on station, fully trained, ready to operate in a very demanding environment, and to do that by 30 September 2018. The build has been arduous, as the teams have had to carry out operations as they are built. What’s happening right as we create them is we’re already using them, Army Maj. Gen. Paul Nakasone, commander of the Cyber National Mission Force, said at CSIS. Each service branch has a commitment to contribute to the overall 133 teams under their individual cyber divisions; 13 from the Marine Corps, 41 from the Army, 39 from the Air Force and 40 from the Navy. The Army currently has 33 of its 41 teams, an improvement from 2013, when the service only had two, while the Air Force bolstered its cyber mission force by roughly 40 percent last year. The question of manning new cyber teams was a challenge. Robert Naething, deputy to the commanding general of the Fifth Army, offered anecdotal insight into the manning question as it pertains to the first cyber protection brigade being built at Fort Gordon, Ga., home of the Army Cyber Center of Excellence. As we were looking at this manning, you typically bring a soldier in, you teach him how to be a tanker or something, but you say ‘no, this is a high level skill.’ So do we have to go out there and somehow recruit a bunch of Ph.Ds. out of MIT? Well, how do you do that, how do you pay for them, how do you keep them busy and what do you bring them in as? he said at a webinar hosted by Defense One. And so that was really not very tenable. So, as we were trying to figure out how do you man the Army cyber units, really the only immediate solution was to reach out to the Army to see the soldiers we already had…and try and build it initial capacity. And the phenomenon that took us off guard is, actually, there’s incredible capacity out there within our soldiers that we didn’t expect to find. Attracting and training talent The military has engaged in several initiatives to ensure that the new cyber mission force and the next generation’s cyber warriors are properly equipped. The services have taken to opening hackathons, exercises and cyber ranges for a variety of training and evaluation purposes. For instance, the Army announced last summer the establishment of a Cyber Battle Ground that will be open to all units and will reduce the time and costs of training cyber warriors. It provides a realistic environment for testing skills learned and reinforced in a classroom setting. Air Force and Army Reserve cadets in the Advanced Cyber Education program at the Air Force Institute of Technology last summer took part in a competitive hackfest described as the closest thing to hand-to-hand cyber combat. Participants were forced to think outside the box in competitions involving the construction and defense of enterprise networks while attacking opponents. The Air Force has taken several steps toward attracting uniformed members into its cyber ranks.  According to a spokesperson with the 24th Air Force, these programs include the Stripes for Certification program, which provides opportunities to enlist at higher grades when entering the service with cyber-related certifications, selective reenlistment bonus programs and the Cyberspace Warfare Operations career track for officers to provide qualified cyberspace officers proper growth opportunities. The Air Force is also standing up a cyber proving ground, which was announced in October. A fresh factsheet published on the new Benjamin Foulois Cyber Proving Ground website depicts a center of multi-disciplinary teams from the operational, acquisitions, intelligence, test, and developer communities to rapidly explore potential solutions to meet cyber operational needs and identify, enable, and accelerate implementation of innovative concepts and technologies to improve Air Force cyberspace operational capability. Simulated exercises, however, are going only so far. A recent report submitted to Congress concluded that cyber exercises did not include the full force of possible attacks. Exercise authorities seldom permitted cyber attacks from being conducted to the full extent that an advanced adversary would likely employ during conflict, so actual data on the scope and duration of cyber attacks are limited, the director of the Defense Department’s office of Operational Test & Evaluation discovered. The report concluded that combatant commanders’ reluctance to permit realistic cyber effects during training is due to requirements to achieve several other training objectives during exercises. The report recommended that combatant commanders make serious preparations to conduct critical missions in cyber-contested environments as well as perform periodic operational demonstrations involving operational units, network defenders and cyber protection team elements in order to ensure mission success."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":439,"title":" US Military Wants to Use Artificial Intelligence to Create Cyber Soldiers ","class":0,"body":" The US military has revealed its plans for artificial intelligence on the battlefield. However the military admits that commercial AI firms are ahead of them. The military hopes that AI will one day soon power everything from cyber soldiers to the targeting systems of the F-35. Deputy Defense secretary Robert Work said The Department of Defense is a follower. The commercial world has already made this leap. We have to catch up with them quickly. Speaking at a national security forum co-hosted by the Center for a New American Security and Defense One, Robert admitted that cyber battles of the future will rely on AI. You cannot have a human operator operating at human speed fighting back cyber tech. You are going to need have a learning machine that does that. The US wants to use augmented reality to help ground troops. It will identify targets, sources of gunfire and help with communication. To make this a reality, the military has now awarded research contracts to several companies to develop the technology. The Future of US Military Work also said the much maligned F-35’s smart helmet, which can help pilot’s track targets, was a key project. Speaking of the importance of a strong cyber force, he pointed out that humans should be the only ones to decide to when use lethal force. But when you’re under attack, especially at machine speeds, we want to have a machine that can protect us. We are looking at a large number of very, very advanced things, he added, citing recent programs that will deploy cascades of small drones from larger drone motherships. The Use of Augmented Reality The military envisions using augmented reality to help ground troops identify targets, sources of gunfire and help with communication. This is a part of Darpa’s new Squad X Core Technologies (SXCT) program, which will give US troops the ability to see a multi-faceted picture of their operational environments. This would include the location, nature and activity of both threats and allied forces around them. If we launch seven missiles at a surface action group and one missile goes high, and is looking at all the different things that the battle group is doing to defend itself and it sees something new that’s not in its library, it will immediately report back on the learning network, which will go back to a learning machine, which will create here’s something you should do which will pass it over to human machine collaboration. So the mission commander can make an adjustment on the next salvo and then make a command change inside the software of the missile so that the next seven missiles launch will be that much more effective, Robert added. Technology has already made this type of real-time environment awareness available for aircraft, submarines and tanks. Infantry squads, however, have fallen behind because many of these systems are too bulky to carry on the frontline. Soldiers have to carry over 45kg (100lbs) of gear, which can tire them out quickly. To address this, SXCT program aims to develop technologies that could be integrated into user-friendly systems."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":440,"title":" Taiwan Creates Its Own Cyber Army to Combat China ","class":0,"body":" Taiwan’s new Minister of National Defense Feng Shih-kuan (馮世寬) recently confirmed the intention of the new government to create a Cyber Army (網軍) as the fourth branch of Taiwan’s armed forces. The announcement followed the plan outlined in the Defense Policy Blue Papers published earlier by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which specifically called for the [Integration of] existing military units and capacities of IT, communications, and electronics to establish an independent fourth service branch alongside the current Armed Forces consisting of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.[1] Looking ahead, it will be fruitful to observe what the new Cyber Army can add on top of Taiwan’s existing cybersecurity and cyberwarfare structure. It is easy to see where the impetus for establishing a Cyber Army came from; for many years Taiwan has been on the frontlines of the battle against the ever-intensifying cyber attacks from China. This has reached such an extent that observers and even Taiwanese officials acknowledged Taiwan as a testing ground for China’s cyber army and state-sponsored hackers. The case of the 2015 hacking of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) further illustrates the ambitions and capabilities on the part of the Chinese hackers and the dear consequences of failing to stop such an attack. Similar organizations dedicated to cybersecurity and combined defensive and offensive cyberwarfare capabilities have been established in other countries, such as the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and South Korea’s National Cyber Command (NCC). Moreover, President Obama ordered the creation of the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity earlier this year. Though the Commission serves only as an advisory role, it is yet another move by the administration to address the ever-more prominent issue of cybersecurity. Taiwan’s plan for a Cyber Army however, will make it the first country to assign equal importance to cybersecurity as to the other branches of the armed forces. It should be noted that Taiwan already has a fairly sophisticated cybersecurity and cyberwarfare structure in place. Currently the principle agency in Taiwan specifically tasked with conducting combined defensive and offensive cyberwarfare operations is the Information and Electronic Warfare Command that reports directly to the Ministry of National Defense (MND)’s General Staff Headquarters. Commanded by a Major General with about 2,400 staff under its jurisdiction, the Information and Electronic Warfare Command performs just about every function one can expect of a Cyber Army. In addition, the National Security Bureau (NSB), Taiwan’s principle intelligence agency, also operates a 7th Department as the National Cybersecurity Department, with the primary responsibilities of monitoring and safeguarding Taiwan’s civilian cyberspace and to help defend against national security threats. It is expected that the new Cyber Army will directly appropriate the Information and Electronic Warfare Command together with other agencies under the MND that are related to the operations and managements of signals or electronic intelligence - such as the Office for Communications, Electronics and Information under the MND’s General Staff Headquarters. It has also been reported that the size of this new Cyber Army will reach 6,000 strong and become fully operational by 2019 at the latest. The promotion of a fourth branch among the existing armed forces raises some implications.  Currently there are only eight full (three star) Generals in Taiwan’s military, which include the three Chiefs of the Command Headquarters of Army, Navy, and Air Force, Minister and two Deputy Ministers of Defense, Chief of the General Staff, and Deputy Chief of the General Staff. The creation of a Cyber Army branch would necessitate the promotion of another three star General to head its Command Headquarters, or to transfer an existing one to the position. It is likely that the Cyber Army General will be one that has a Signal Corps background or otherwise has extensive experience in commanding information related units or staff offices. The new Cyber Army also makes it official that the military’s priority is no longer just safeguarding its internal network, but the whole civilian internet as well. Just as many other militaries around the world, Taiwan’s military relies on an intranet network (known as the military network) that is physically separated from the civilian internet (the World Wide Web) for obvious security reasons.  Many computers and networking devices used inside Taiwan’s military bases and installations likely have also been altered to accept only connections that conform to the military network protocol. As such, the new Cyber Army will likely be divided to handle two categorically distinctive areas - that of the Internet network (civilian) and that the of Intranet network (military). Depending on the Tsai administration’s policy it might also be possible for Taiwan’s Cyber Army to provide some form of real-time intelligence sharing on cyber threats with the United States, although any joint cyber operation is unlikely to take place any time soon due to the sensitive political nature involved. Observers have long noted that no country has more experience than Taiwan in dealing with the cyber threats coming out of China, and closer cooperation between the two countries on this area would no doubt benefit the United States’ own cybersecurity efforts. So far the plan to establish a new Cyber Army has been met with mixed receptions in Taiwan. While it has been hailed by many as an indication that the new government is taking the cyber threats Taiwan faces seriously, some have questioned the need to treat cybersecurity as a fourth branch in the service. Lan Ning-li (蘭寧利), a retired Vice Admiral of the Taiwanese Navy, was quoted in the news commenting  on the existing Information and Electronic Warfare Command as already functioning in full strength as a Cyber Army and thus he does not see an urgent need to make it more prominent than it is now. This raises the question of whether Taiwan’s new Cyber army actually has a more ambitious, offensive strategic design in mind than what has been discussed on the surface. Many observers have been calling for Taiwan to adopt more asymmetric means to help deter Chinese threats, and cyber is no doubt one of the areas where Taiwan excels at and has a potential to offset Chinese superiority in conventional arms. After all, maybe the best deterrence against threats coming from the cyber is the ability to strike back, and the new, elevated Cyber Army would be a good starting point for Taiwan to increase that capacity. Po-Chang (Paul) Huang is an Intern at the Project 2049 Institute.  He is currently a Master’s candidate at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, where he focuses on Security Studies and issues related to East Asia."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":441,"title":"China has made obedience to the State a game","class":0,"body":"With a concept straight out of a cyberpunk dystopia, China has gamified obedience to the State. China has created a social tool named Sesame Credit which gives people a score for how good a citizen they are. The system measures how obediently citizens follow the party line, pulling data from social networks and online purchase histories. As Extra Credits explains on YouTube: If you post pictures of Tiananmen Square or share a link about the recent stock market collapse, your Sesame Credit goes down. Share a link from the state-sponsored news agency about how good the economy is doing and your score goes up. Similarly, Sesame Credit can analyse data from online purchases. If you're making purchases the state deems valuable, like work shoes or local agricultural products, your score goes up. If you import anime from Japan though, down the score goes. Most insidious of all, the app will have real world consequences. According to Extra Credits, high scores will grant users benefits: Like making it easier to get the paperwork you need to travel or making it easier to get a loan. Although the ratings are currently optional, the social tool will become mandatory by 2020.  There have even been rumours about implementing penalties for low scores: Like slower internet speeds, or restricting jobs a low scoring person is allowed to hold. The system could also become a powerful tool for social conditioning, as users could lose points for having friends with low obedience scores. There has already been some evidence of Chinese citizens competing with one another to get high scores, posting their Sesame Credit scores on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, Quartz reports. Earlier this year, the BBC reported the Chinese governmennt was building a social credit system to rate each citizen's trustworthiness. A planning document from China's State Council explained the credit will forge a public opinion environment that trust-keeping is glorious and warned the new system will reward those who report acts of breach of trust."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":442,"title":"Blog: Space and Cyber Domains Combined Create 'Synergistic' Safeguards, General Says","class":0,"body":"Every military operation conducted around the world is enabled by space as well as cyber operations, domains closely linked and threatened alike. As it is with cyber, and as the world is certainly witness to, our space domain is critically important, said Maj. Gen. Roger Teague, USAF, director of space programs in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Acquisition for the U.S. Air Force. Everything we do, whether it’s a pizza delivery, GPS, farming, banking, precision timing [or] communication—our nation is critically dependent on our space capabilities, as are our warfighters, Gen. Teague said during the final day of AFCEA International’s inaugural TechNet Air 2016 symposium, wrapping up today in San Antonio.  It’s important that we understand and acknowledge that tie [between space and cyber], Gen. Teague added. It is through both domains, as well as the integration of our air, land and sea domains, that we’re able to create those synergistic effects not only on the battlefield, but also to sustain our daily lives.  The world is going through a rapidly changing environment, Gen. Teague said, marked by rising threats that are constantly changing the way we have to think about space as a domain, space as an operational environment, he said. It is no longer a sanctuary, Gen. Teague warned. For decades, the United States knew who its neighbors were in the space domain, and understood norms of behavior. There are an increasing number of hostile actions that cause great concern, especially when you consider the significant amount of national treasure that we have on orbit, he shared.  The Air Force’s efforts to not only address space-based threats, but extinguish them, are found in several command programs. On the horizon for the Air Force is continued work on acquiring protected satellite communications services and identifying the proper balance between military-delivered satellite communications (SATCOM) and commercially provided offerings. An analysis of alternatives, or AOA, is scheduled to be completed this summer.  Another project includes the Weather System Follow-on (WSF), set to replace the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program and other Defense Department environmental monitoring satellites. The WSF is a system to provide timely and reliable space-based remote sensing capabilities for global environmental observations of atmospheric, terrestrial, oceanographic and solar-geophysical requirements. An acquisition strategy document should be approved this in summer 2016. Additionally, the next satellite of the Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) constellation is slated for a summer launch, as is a running of the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellite program at full capability for one of the final assessments. SBIRS is ranked as one of the nation’s highest priorities and provides global, persistent, infrared surveillance capabilities in the four national security areas of missile warning, missile defense, technical intelligence and battlespace awareness. It is the unblinking eye that allows us to sleep at night, Gen. Teague said. Much of future requirements would not be possible without industry involvement, Teague assured, and outlined elements of various programs in an effort to pique attendee interest. It’s important to know what the force mix looks like, he said, using term to define military, industry and academia partnerships.

{"id":444,"title":"Pentagon creates award for U.S. drone pilots, cyber warriors","class":0,"body":"New military awards will recognize U.S. troops who have directly affected battles as drone pilots or in cyber operations, the Defense Department said on Thursday. The changes follow an 18-month review which made broader recommendations including standardizing criteria for awards recognizing valorous conduct across all services. The new award for drone pilots or cyber operators will be a letter R device to be affixed to existing service medals. Intelligence officers are unlikely to be eligible for the award, officials said. It is for those who have a direct and immediate impact who don't incur the risk of combat, a defense official said. Drones have been President Barack Obama's counterterrorism weapon of choice since he took office in 2009, and have been used in the U.S. pursuit of militant groups in Somalia, Nigeria, Yemen, Syria, Pakistan, and elsewhere. As the impact of remote operations on combat continues to increase, the necessity of ensuring those actions are distinctly recognized grows, the Pentagon said in a statement outlining the changes. The department conducted 37 focus groups as part of the review, initiated by former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Groups including the Veterans of Foreign Wars had opposed earlier plans to create a medal to recognize remote operators, saying it was unfair to give it a status higher than some awards for actions taken directly on the battlefield. The Pentagon scrapped plans for a medal in 2013. In a statement on Thursday, the VFW said it supported the creation of the R device, which it said would recognize contributions of thousands of service members made from afar. Defense officials are also looking at about 1100 recommendations for Silver Star and Service Cross medals made since Sept. 11, 2001 during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the wars continued, commanders became more willing to upgrade recommendations for medals, the Pentagon said. So it is reviewing awards to determine if any earlier ones ought to be upgraded to the Medal of Honor."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":445,"title":"Cisco Creates £8m Cyber-Security Scholarship Program","class":0,"body":" The scholarship program and improved certifications are aimed at growing the number of skilled cyber-security experts, officials say Cisco Systems is throwing £7.5 million ($10m) behind a new effort to increase the number of skilled cyber-security experts in the market. The giant networking vendor is introducing a $10 million scholarship program, while at the same time enhancing its security certification portfolio, all with the goal of bringing more talent into the cyber-security pool and closing an expected worldwide shortage of skilled professionals that could reach 2 million by 2019. The effort comes at a time when cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and organizations are lacking the skills necessary to protect themselves. A recent report found that in a survey of the global IT professionals, more than half said that less than 25 percent of applicants for cyber-security jobs were qualified to do the work the jobs required. Two-fold problem Any entity with an online presence is faced with a two-fold problem: Cyber criminals are rapidly proliferating and their tactics are evolving, but businesses don’t have the skilled individuals they need to anticipate vulnerabilities and lock down security, Tejas Vashi, director of product strategy and marketing for Cisco Services, wrote in a post on the company blog. To make matters worse, technology changes rapidly, often leaving IT professionals without the advanced skills necessary to protect their companies. Imagine what those vulnerabilities can do to undermine not only businesses, but also municipalities, military installations, government agencies, and other entities. Organizations for several years have worried about the lack of skilled cyber-security professionals. In a survey of 476 security and business executives published late last year by the SANS Institute for DomainTools, almost 60 percent of respondents said they didn’t have the skills and resources to adequately protect themselves from a breach. With Cisco’s new Global Cybersecurity Scholarship program, the vendor will invest the $10 million over two years with the goal of growing the talent pool around the world. As part of the program, Cisco will offer training, mentoring and certification that are aligned with the position of security operations center analyst, Vashi wrote. In addition, the vendor will work with a broad array of organizations—including diversity programs, veterans groups and people in the early stages of their careers—to use this scholarship as a launching point for their employees’ careers in cyber-security. The goal is to give people the necessary skills and on-the-job capabilities to address issues of network security, officials said. CCNA In addition, the company is launching the new Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Cyber Ops certification that assesses a person’s skills in such areas as monitoring IT security systems, detecting cyber-attacks, analyzing evidence, correlating information and coordinating responses to incidents. At the same time, the vendor is updating its existing Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE) Security certification with updates at the expert level that assess a person’s capabilities with emerging and evolving technologies, including advanced threat protection, advanced malware protection, next-generation IPS, virtualization, automation and information exchange. There also is a new assessment in such areas as network programmability, the Internet of things (IoT) and the cloud. For their part, companies can hire from this fresh talent pool while also electing to reskill existing IT employees, conferring significantly enhanced value on workers who already know a company’s culture, infrastructure, and IT landscape, Vashi wrote. The IoT and cloud computing are creating an environment where tens of billions of connected devices are creating 277 times more data than individuals themselves are creating, pushing into the zettabyte range, he wrote. Given then increasing connectivity between systems and the massive amounts of data they’re generating, another level of trust is needed. We must trust the systems that manage and process the data, the people and partners who access the data, and the systems, controls, fundamental technologies, and processes that protect the data, Vashi wrote. It’s increasingly clear that the entire online industry must do its part to train workers, helping them acquire the critical skills necessary to secure the Internet of Things."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":446,"title":"Professional Education Center offers Cyber Common Technical Core training","class":0,"body":"CAMP ROBINSON, Ark. - Cyber threats are in the news almost every day. The recent cybersecurity incidents at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management are only the latest events. The Army National Guard is preparing to play a key role in the defense of our nation in cyberspace. The Cyber Soldier of the future will have to be able to understand the dangers, detect threats and harden our networks in an environment that is constantly changing. The ARNG and ANG are in the process of forming Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) and other Cyber elements. One of the key elements of this new era is having Guard Soldiers and Airmen trained in the latest techniques and procedures, and the National Guard Professional Education Center (PEC) is leading that effort. In coordination with the Cyber Center of Excellence (CCoE) at Fort Gordon, Georgia, the Professional Educational Center at Camp Robinson, Arkansas, is developing a new block of instruction referred to as Cyber Common Technical Core (CCTC). Designed to meet equivalency of current National Security Agency (NSA), Intermediate Cyber Core (ICC) training, CCTC will enhance individual skills giving them the background they need to properly defend our nation’s military communications networks. The training is designed for enlisted Soldiers, warrant officers and commissioned officers. When trained, service members will be ready to serve in various Cyber work roles within the cyber protection teams and other formations the same way current Guard units do when needed. The long range goal for PEC is to open the CCTC to other DoD agencies, allowing all services to speak a common language and have similar skill sets. The CCTC course is scheduled to be an 8-week course with four phases. The first phase will cover the Windows operating system with phase two covering the Linux operating system and the differences between the two. Phase three will cover networking, and the fourth phase provides training on security concepts. Phase four will culminate with several scenario based, real-world situations to test the student’s fundamental understanding of the curriculum. The first iteration of the course will wrap up at the end of July. It is comprised of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in cyber security to include members of the 1636th ARNG CPT stationed at Laurel, Maryland, four active duty Army personnel, three members of the USAR and two active duty Navy personnel. This session is heavily engaged in developing the course and training materials, according to Lt. Col. Tony Caldwell, ARNG G3 ODI at the National Guard Bureau. The second iteration will have a small number of SMEs from the states that have been awarded the first M-Day CPTs and other DoD agencies. That group will meet at PEC to continue course development, including scenarios and testing material. This session’s sole purpose is to take the product we have now and improve it to support the third session at Fort Gordon, Caldwell said. The third iteration of CCTC will be conducted at the Army Cyber School at Fort Gordon in October of 2015. The focus of this session will be to train instructors, course developers, and course managers for both PEC and the Army Cyber School. The goal of that session is to train and develop the personnel critical to course approval by U.S. Army Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). PEC is slated to host a fourth development session in January 2016. The intent of the Army Cyber School and ARNG for this session is to demonstrate to USCYBERCOM and TRADOC that the course is ready to be validated. Once CCTC is validated and approved by USCC and TRADOC it is the Army Cyber School’s intent to support PEC as a satellite campus of the CCoE to teach approved Cyber Course, according to Caldwell. To differentiate cyber personnel from other career fields, the Army has created a new Cyber Operations career field 17. The 17 CF will be low density; that is, rather small in physical size and very specialized with a requirement for both lengthy and continuous training in order to keep abreast of changing trends. The initial members of these teams will primarily come from Soldiers who are Information Technology Specialists, career field (CF) 25, as well as from Military Intelligence CF 35, but both of those CFs will continue to operate in their own right. Other operational CFs (e.g. 11 and 13, to name a few and some functional areas) will also be leveraged in a limited capacity. To qualify for the award of a 17 series, individuals will have to complete a rigorous and lengthy training pipeline that will include the Cyber Common Technical Core (CCTC) training that is under development in conjunction with the Army Cyber School at the Professional Education Center in Little Rock. What makes this training so unique is that it is the tip of the spear for the United States Army. No other military service has the exact same version of this course; it is being developed to meet National Security Agency (NSA) equivalency."}

The new units will be formed amid NATO’s continuing build-up across Eastern and Central Europe. I cannot but mention such a critical task which is the formation of three divisions in the western theater. The task is extremely important, TASS reported Shoigu as telling journalists. Shoigu also added that alongside the creation of the new divisions, the army will have to set up proper infrastructure including barracks, firing ranges and military hardware depots. While details of the new formations are unknown, the minister’s announcement came amid a US and NATO military build-up in Central and Eastern Europe – against what Washington and its allies call Russian aggression. UPDATE: Continued NATO expansion will see response from Moscow – Kremlin https://t.co/8QEIu6hEhLpic.twitter.com/4PDFNzu74U — RT (@RT_com) December 2, 2015 The new edition of Russia’s military doctrine, signed by President Vladimir Putin in December 2015, specifies that NATO’s militarization and arms build-ups pose a national security threat to Russia that requires an appropriate response. The standoff between NATO and Russia escalated last year after Ukraine, which previously insisted on its non-aligned status, went through a violent protest that ousted its elected government and imposed a new one with the West’s vocal approval. Kiev’s new authorities have since made joining NATO one of their strategic goals, claiming that they need protection against Russia. Over the past year, NATO has dramatically increased the number and pace of massive military drills across Europe, most intensively near Russia’s borders. 'NATO expansion goes overboard': key points of Russia's national security strategy for 2016 https://t.co/gO08duGMpapic.twitter.com/DUmwrXkPNT — RT (@RT_com) January 1, 2016 In November, the alliance launched its massive Trident Juncture 2015 exercises involving 36,000 troops, as well as more than 60 warships and around 200 aircraft from all NATO member states. Seven more partner nations were involved: Australia, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Finland, Macedonia, Sweden and Ukraine. This made Trident Juncture the biggest drill since 2002, when about 40,000 troops took part in NATO’s Strong Resolve exercise. Additionally, to boost what it calls its deterrence of Russia, NATO has moved a remarkable amount of heavy weapons, including tanks and self-propelled artillery, to Baltic states on a rotational basis. With the Kremlin having said that NATO’s build-up will lead to reciprocal measures, about 30 units and forces have already been created in the Western Military District since the beginning of 2015, according to the Russian Defense Ministry."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":448,"title":"Cyber Team Forms at the Coast Guard Academy","class":0,"body":"NEW LONDON — A newly formed cyber team at the Coast Guard Academy is providing a route for cadets to deepen their knowledge of computer networks — how they work, how to secure them, and how to identify vulnerabilities within them — while also earning sports credit for their participation. Put simply, the cadets are learning about hacking, a term that can take on a number of different meanings including accessing a computer network legally or otherwise. Higher-ups in the Coast Guard have already begun to notice the team. What they're doing at the academy is critical to the future of the Coast Guard Cyber Command, Capt. Michael Dickey, deputy commander of the newly formed command, said in a recent phone interview. About a month ago, the command sent a team to the academy in response to a cybersecurity incident. Dickey did not offer details but said that cadets supported the incident response team in addressing the problem. We had fantastic support from the cadets, Dickey said. There were a couple (of cadets) in particular who were just a fantastic contribution. At the request of the incident response team, cadets will participate on the command's Cyber Guard team this summer. The two-week-long cyber defense exercise with a focus on protecting critical infrastructure networks involves several government agencies and the military. The exercise will be the command's first foray into a relationship with the academy around cybersecurity, Dickey said. The cyber team isn't guided by any formalized instruction. Instead, a core group of five cadets, who were already participating in cybersecurity competitions and are advanced in their ability, are teaching a handful of others who are just starting to learn. There's not really anything I can teach them beyond what they learn in their electrical engineering courses, said Lt. Grant Wyman, team coach and an instructor in the electrical engineering department. The team captain, First-class cadet Caleb Stewart, an electrical engineering major, explained that this is a field in which many are self-taught. Stewart, who was homeschooled in Grandview, Texas, started computer programming when he was in high school. I started out with games, so I made real simple games like little Mario clones, Minesweeper, he said. Then I was really interested at the lower level, how computers work and then how they operated. A cybersecurity competition last year served as the jumping off point for the team. Since 2001, the National Security Agency has hosted an annual competition called the Cyber Defense Exercise, known as CDX. Stewart and several other Coast Guard Academy cadets competed against cadets and midshipmen from the four other U.S. service academies and the Royal Military College of Canada. During the exercise, which is carried out through virtual, private networks, each team sets up a computer network and an NSA red team tries to attack them. Our job is basically to keep them out, Stewart said, explaining that the network we set up is very similar to what you would see on a corporate network. Teams receive points for keeping the NSA out, but also keeping the services on their networks up and running. Generally, someone could hack into a computer network by cracking a password, creating a fake user account, exploiting openings such as ports that aren't properly secured, or crash one of the services running on the network, among other techniques. Defending usually entails monitoring lines and lines of computer logs for indicators of compromise, essentially any vulnerabilities such as an administrator logged on who shouldn't be or an unknown file showing up on a computer. Competitions allow you to put yourself in the shoes of the bad guy, Wyman said. Both he and Stewart emphasized that learning hacking techniques leads to a greater knowledge of how to defend a network. In early February, members of the team will compete at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's competition called CyberStakes in Pittsburgh. To prepare, they'll participate in online competitions. The team met for its first official week of practice last week and is still in the beginning stages. In early November, Rear Adm. James Rendon, academy superintendent, gave his approval for those on the team to receive sports credit. The dean of academics, the commandant of cadets and the director of athletics also gave the go-ahead. Our job is to maintain and, hopefully, grow their relentless enthusiasm by continually placing them in challenging situations and getting the heck out of their way, Dr. Kurt Colella, dean of academics, said in a prepared statement. Stewart wears a team captain badge pinned to his uniform, as do all other sport captains. By being an official sports team, it enables cadets who participate to have a dedicated two-hour window Monday through Thursday to practice and hone their skills. Cadets are required to complete two sports credits in a school year, which they can earn through varsity, club or intramural sports — and now through the cyber team. Members are eligible to earn half a credit in the spring and half a credit in the fall. But only those on the competitive team, who show up regularly and engage in competitions, will receive the credit, according to Wyman. The team currently features two types of members, competitive and developmental. Wyman said he plans to create a code of conduct for ethical hacking to ensure the cadets use their knowledge for good, although he said he doubted that would be a problem. The lure of private industry could prove a problem down the line. Dickey acknowledged a reality faced by the Coast Guard and other government agencies: the potential for private industry to poach their members through more lucrative job offers. In the cadets' case, however, they are required to serve in the Coast Guard for five years after graduating, so the Coast Guard knows that they will have them for at least that period of time. I would love to create dozens of opportunities for young officers and enlisted personnel who are interested in cyber, Dickey said. Funding, training and retention are the biggest challenges to accomplishing that. A few cadets have already received off-handed job offers from private industry, according to Wyman, who described the offers as 'Hey, if you ever get out of the Coast Guard, give me a call' type of thing."}

Lyle School of Engineering. Together they will work on research projects in cybersecurity. Education initiatives as well as opportunities for SMU students to intern at Raytheon will be offered. I got accepted to SMU before I went on my last deployment with the Navy and they saved my spot to start the subsequent semester after I had decided to extend my service for another six months in order for me to actually make the deployment. So getting the news that SMU was partnering with Raytheon was a pleasant surprise. I have fond memories of my alma mater. I was too old to get the full experience, but certainly not too old too enjoy myself while I learned from some of the great minds of literature. SMU is not the only one educating cyber defense to students that will have a massive effect in the future of the cyber world. The Naval Academy received a donation from Leidos in support for its Fall cybersecurity studies and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) also continued with its contract under the Department of Defense (DoD) to develop technologies and practices through its own research and to apply technologies developed by outside organizations to solve engineering and cybersecurity challenges in fields including aerospace, transportation, banking and finance, energy, robotics, and industrial automation. The work we do together benefits SMU and Raytheon, government and industry, and ultimately anyone with a laptop or smart phone. It will also help train our students to become part of a desperately needed workforce of cyber defenders, says Fred Chang, director of the Deason Institute and the Bobby B. Lyle Endowed Centennial Distinguished Chair in Cyber Security. In a recent warfare evolution blog by Ray Alderman, he discussed where the future of war might be headed. While we still have work to do, he posed an interesting possibility in which a war exists with no casualties. The Naval Academy Foundation’s senior director even posted his thoughts that tomorrow’s war will be a cyber one. Collaboration between academic centers of excellence like SMU and industry leaders like Raytheon is a powerful engine for innovation, says Dave Wajsgras, president of Raytheon Intelligence, Information and Services. These students and naval cadets from different parts of life are ahead of the game. They will be influenced by the past and determine the future. Part of SMU’s academic success, I think, is the relationship that they foster with students. This provides another opportunity for students to thrive in an environment that can grow exponentially."}

The new funding and expansion moves are the latest in a string of achievements this year, including: Introducing one of the industry’s first products optimized for cyber audits for the emerging cyber insurance industry that can help insurers and the insured evaluate risk and continually monitor security preparedness. A partnership with security intelligence innovator Sixgill to integrate technology that automatically collects, monitors and analyzes information from the Darknet Cyberattacks will cost the average U.S. business $15 million in 2015— 19 percent more than last year, according to a Ponemon Institute study. Now is the time to intensify our efforts in the U.S., said Zandani. New York is the headquarters for many of the world’s pre-eminent companies. Industry analysts state that more than 50 percent of the cybersecurity spend will be in the U.S., and we are here to help businesses invest in the proper solutions for their firms."}

{"id":458,"title":"University of San Diego to Open Center of Cyber Security Engineering and Technology in Order to Combat Advanced Persistent Threats to the Nation","class":0,"body":"SAN DIEGO, CA. – Imagine these scenarios: A massive data breach puts the personal information of four million federal employees at risk. Syrian rebels hack into the U.S. electric grid and cause a blackout in a major city. And a major retailer pays $10 million to settle a lawsuit related to the breach of credit card account information. As cyber attacks threaten the security, prosperity and privacy of the United States and its citizens, the University of San Diego announces the creation of its Center for Cyber Security Engineering and Technology to address these challenges through education, training and research. What makes our new center unique is its comprehensive focus on all aspects of cyber security, said Jason Lemon, Dean of Professional and Continuing Education at the University of San Diego. The Center’s activities will encompass education and training through a full range of educational opportunities. The community can access USD’s cyber security expertise through degree and certificate programs, inviting USD’s cyber experts to participate in projects focusing on the evaluation and development of their own systems and strategies to mitigate cyber threats, and developing internal leadership on cyber security IT, cyber security law, forensics and incident response. There simply is no other university bringing together this kind of expertise and offering so many different degrees, programs, and access points like USD’s center does. A private event to launch the new Center is planned for this summer at the University of San Diego. Currently in the planning approval stage, the Center is preparing to support a Master of Science in Cyber Security Engineering offered by USD’s School of Engineering and a Master of Science in Cyber Security Information Technology Leadership offered by the university. The Cyber IT Leadership degree will be available fully online. Program websites will be available when campus and accreditation approvals are received. Several certificate programs for public enrollment will also be available to address a variety of subjects such as cyber security, risk management, cyber intelligence, cyber security assessment and testing, and cyber security policy and law. The forthcoming information security degree programs will be designed for working professionals, and will be taught by USD faculty and cyber professionals who bring decades of current and real-world experience to their students. The Center will also advance research, discovery and development of the tools to assist consumers, corporations, nonprofits, utilities, and the military find the solutions needed to solve the many challenges presented by cyber attacks. By combining the strengths and vision of the Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering and USD’s Professional and Continuing Education, the Center is poised to be extremely nimble and creative in meeting the needs of students, serving a broad base of individual, corporate, public, private and military stakeholders who seek cyber security education and solutions, and in responding quickly in this dynamic and ever-changing field, said Chell Roberts, Dean of the Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering. The Center also will be a key player in the San Diego region’s efforts to be recognized as the National Center of Cyber Security Excellence, a goal the City of San Diego has established.  USD’s Center for Cyber Security Engineering and Technology will actively contribute to this dynamic segment of the local economy that now accounts for more than $1.6 billion of economic activity each year in San Diego. Veteran cyber security expert and educator, Winnie Callahan, will lead USD’s new Center. John Callahan will be the program director for the new degree programs. Winnie Callahan led the design, build-out, marketing and program development as the Executive Director of The Peter Kiewit Institute in Nebraska, recognized as one of the most successful collaboration of engineering, information technology and business immersion in the nation."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":459,"title":"Cyber warfare: Iran opens a new front","class":0,"body":"The first neighbourhood they unplugged was Olaya, Riyadh’s wealthiest and gaudiest central district. By the time they had finished their rampage through the computer systems behind the power grid, the infiltrators believed they had left millions without electricity, crippling hospitals and military facilities. What the hackers, whose use of Farsi and bespoke malware gave away their Iranian origins, did not realise was that the critical computer networks they had compromised were fake. The network, complete with Arabic scripting and precise names of individual substations and pylons, was the work of MalCrawler, a cyber security group specialising in protecting industrial computer systems. It was just one of a set of intricate digital honeytraps designed to gauge the intentions of the attackers who routinely tried to crack into the systems owned by MalCrawler’s clients. Equally intricate models were made of European, American and Israeli power systems. The evidence from the models aligned. The Chinese hungrily scooped up anything that looked like novel technical information. The Russians permeated deep into systems, mapping them and implanting hard-to-find backdoor access for potential future use. But neither dared do damage — unlike Iran. Among the world’s big five cyber superpowers — the US, UK, Israel, Russia and China — MalCrawler concluded there was a digital equilibrium in military cyber offence based on assumptions over deterrence and reprisal. But in the Middle East, that’s not the case at all, says Dewan Chowdhury, MalCrawler’s chief executive. The mindset just seemed completely different — it wasn’t espionage or some kind of targeted operation necessarily, it was just to do as much damage as possible. The model MalCrawler designed to replicate the Israeli power grid was hit just as hard as the Saudi one. The hackers, again displaying tell-tale signs of Iranian origin, fatally compromised the safety systems of what they thought was one of Israel’s nuclear power stations. Iran is rapidly emerging as the sixth member of the cyber superpower club. Denuded of its nuclear ambitions by the landmark deal struck last year to limit uranium and plutonium enrichment, some fear Tehran will wield its cyber arsenal as an equally long-range weapon with which to menace its adversaries. Before the [nuclear] deal, cyber was just one option they used for leverage, but now, post deal, it is even more central to their toolkit, says one senior Middle Eastern intelligence official. Iran is poised to do something in cyber that will change the way the world looks at it … the US knows this. [The US] saw what they [Iran] did during the agreement and they know what they are doing after it. Industrial sabotage While high-tech espionage is rife — for strategic state advantage and commercial and criminal gain — destructive acts of cyber attack remain rare. Iran is the only country that has both been on the receiving end of a major act of physical cyber-sabotage and the perpetrator of such an attack. In 2008, the Stuxnet computer worm, created by the US and Israel was unleashed on Iran’s nuclear programme. In 2012, Iranian hackers struck Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Aramco, nearly obliterating its corporate IT infrastructure, and bringing the company close to collapse. Aramco was a wake-up call for Iran’s adversaries. Nearly four years on, just how strong are Iran’s cyber capabilities and what, if anything, will Tehran seek to do with them? Their abilities are growing fast and they are diversifying. They’re getting harder and harder to track, says one senior intelligence official from within the five-eyes alliance — the digital intelligence-sharing group comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and US. There is certainly a big move towards having more destructive capability. They want to be able to do more Aramcos. Right now they are researching, practising. Tehran says it spends $1bn a year on cyber programmes. By contrast GCHQ, Britain’s electronic surveillance and cyber defence service, annually spends around $2bn. While its industrial oil production systems were unaffected, Aramco was nearly fatally compromised because so much of its corporate infrastructure was destroyed. Company officials had to use typewriters and faxes to try and keep billions of dollars of oil trades from falling through. Domestically, the company gave oil away for several days following the attack because it could not process transactions."}

On Friday, Governor John Hickenlooper signed a cyber-security initiative bill into law and jumpstarted the initiative by revealing plans for the new National Cyber Intelligence Center in Colorado Springs. State funds totaling to $8 million will be used to renovate a UCCS-owned building that will house the Center. The goal is to protect local military – along with state, federal, and local government – as well as local businesses. Retired Army Lieutenant General Ed Anderson will head the nation’s Cyber Intelligence Center as the executive director. As you know the three pillars – cyber institute, the cyber research education and training center, and the rapid response center – those three but too often people look at those things as separate entities and they’re not, said Anderson. We picked those and designed those for them to work together. Additionally, he said the goal isn’t exactly to help large corporations but to keep an eye out on local businesses. Small businesses and medium-sized businesses who don’t have the resources to be able to have their own organic cyber security capability and so we will be able to help them, said Anderson. Governor Hickenlooper said cyber attacks are a reality and we can’t let it happen to us. A large attack all of our critical infrastructure could be at risk the very way we do business if people don’t trust in being able to do their business on the internet, said Hickenlooper. All of a sudden we take a giant step backwards, and we want to make sure that doesn’t happen. Local government and military will also be in line for protection. Air Force Space Command, NORAD, and so many of our critical military missions that are here that are so cyber dependent, said Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers. The whole idea is to always stay ahead of a possible attack. The opening of the center is slated for the end of the year."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":463,"title":"Russians open cyber front in Crimea","class":0,"body":"Russia’s incursion into Ukraine’s Crimea places a spotlight once again on Russia’s employment of cyberspace operations in support of geostrategic objectives and tactical military operations in its near-abroad. The Associated Press reported on 3 March that Russia’s internet monitoring agency blocked 13 internet sites linked to the Ukrainian protest movement, including that of the largest pro-Ukrainian demonstration site. On 28 February Ukrainian telecom provider Ukrtelecom JSC reported on its website that it had lost its technical ability to provide a link between the Crimean peninsula and the rest of Ukraine due to physical damage to fibre-optic trunk cables, significantly affecting fixed telephony, internet, and mobile services (http://www.ukrtelecom.ua/presscenter/news/official?id=120327). While this latter outage has not been attributed to any official Russian entity, it does follow a historical trend of Russia employing integrated cyberspace operations as part of its recent strategic and military actions. Estonia experienced several weeks of co-ordinated strategic cyber attacks against its financial and sociopolitical institutions in 2007. Although the origin of these attacks cannot be definitively attributed to Russia, it is widely believed that Moscow was behind the attacks in response to perceived anti-Russian policies. In July and August 2008 substantial distributed denial-of-services attacks occurred against Georgian websites, rendering most Georgian governmental websites inoperative. These attacks coincided with the movement of Russian troops into South Ossetia on 9 August 2008 in response to Georgian military operations launched a day earlier. Most recently, in August 2013, RIA Novisti reported that the Russian military had decided to create a separate branch focused on cyber warfare and the Russian Foundation for Advanced Military Research listed cyber warfare as one of three main areas of research. Consequently, current cyberspace activities in Ukraine, coupled with analysis of past Russian incursions and current tactical focus, suggest that Russia will continue to use cyberspace operations in an integrated fashion with other strategic and tactical capabilities to maintain influence in its near-abroad. IHS Jane’s believes that cyberspace operations will remain disruptive in Ukraine and not destructive at the strategic level. In other words, it is unlikely Russia will employ cyberspace capabilities to destroy key critical infrastructure (such as power grids or transportation systems) since this would cross a line, indicating significant escalation and potentially prompting an international response. Tactical use of cyberspace operations, on the other hand, can be expected to degrade, disrupt, and deny the Ukrainian military use of its command-and-control nodes and thus adversely affect Ukrainian military decision-making."}

EU courts recently ruled a previous data-transfer treaty with the US invalid, following the Snowden revelations of NSA data collection. Starting in late 2016, Microsoft’s cloud offerings will be hosted from the new data centers in Magdeburg and Frankfurt, CEO Satya Nadella announced Wednesday.  The Redmond-based corporation is partnering with Deutsche Telekom AG, whose sister company T-Systems will act as a trustee over the data, according to Reuters. Microsoft’s cloud offerings include the infrastructure service Azure, the customer-management platform Dynamics CRM Online and the widely popular Office 365. The German data centers will serve customers in the EU and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. We're expanding our #European#cloud w/ new services in Germany, Netherlands, Ireland & UK: https://t.co/B57ccyl5Ccpic.twitter.com/xUBzSLmLea — Microsoft Europe (@MSEurope) November 11, 2015 With this partnership with T-Systems, Microsoft customers can choose a data protection level that complies with the requirements of German customers and many clients of the public sector, the director of the new Digital Division of the Deutsche Telekom subsidiary T-Systems, Anette Bronder said, as cited by AFP. Deutsche Telekom pledges all customer data will remain exclusively in Germany. With the data centers under the control of a German company, any requests for access to the data by the US spy agencies will have to go through the German government. Last month, a ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) practically scrapped a 15-year old ‘Safe Harbor’ agreement that enabled internet businesses to move and store Europeans’ data on servers located in the US. The decision came as a result of a 2013 complaint by Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, who argued that the US law did not offer sufficient protection against surveillance of data sent to the United States via Facebook. Schrems filed the complaint after the revelations of mass surveillance made by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. In late October, German authorities announced they would investigate subsidiaries of US tech companies for violations of EU privacy laws. Anyone who wants to remain untouched by the legal and political implications of the judgment, should in the future consider storing personal data only on servers within the European Union, Johannes Casper, the Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information in Hamburg, told Der Spiegel. On Monday, a Belgian court ruled that Facebook violated EU privacy laws by tracking people without their consent using the so-called ‘datr’ cookie. The tracking cookie was placed on an internet user’s system when they visited a Facebook.com site or ‘Liked’ a page on other websites. This has allowed Facebook to monitor the user’s browsing habits in order to target them with advertising offerings. The ‘Safe Harbor’ treaty is currently being renegotiated, with an eye on keeping the Europeans’ data safe – or at least safer – from the NSA’s prying eyes."}

China Railway Group Ltd. is part of a consortium of companies that won a rail project in Egypt worth $1.1 billion, while China State Construction Engineering Corp. signed a $2.7 billion contract to build a convention center, parliament and government offices, the two companies said in separate filings to the Shanghai stock exchange Friday. Xi’s five-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran, his first to the Middle East since taking power in November 2012, marks 60 years of relations between Beijing and the Arab League. The deals are part of China’s One Belt, One Road strategy that aims to strengthen economic and transport ties across Eurasia, while raising China’s profile as a global power. By visiting Tehran, Xi is seeking to maintain Chinese influence accumulated during Iran’s long isolation. Xi is the first major world leader to visit Tehran since the U.S. and European Union lifted sanctions Jan. 16, clearing the way for Iran’s reintegration into the global economy.

{"id":467,"title":"Iran Has Built an Army of Cyber-Proxies","class":0,"body":"Katherine Archuleta, the now ex-director of the U.S. government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), probably never expected that she would have to resign after only two years of service. Insisting that she was as angry as anyone about the recent hack of OPM’s computer system, which according to ABC potentially exposed the personal information of tens of millions of people, she crusaded valiantly for her job despite opposition from Republicans and Democrats alike. The cyber-attack that so angered Archuleta and members of Congress was subsequently attributed to China by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. If he is correct, the OPM hack is the latest in a long list of Chinese cyber-attacks. They started in 2009 with the successful hack of U.S. military contractors’ computers, which was undertaken in order to steal the plans for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. They moved on to leading energy companies such as Marathon Oil, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips. Then came a campaign against large media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. China is not alone in using cyber-attacks against the United States. Iran has been linked to attacks against billionaire casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands Corp. Numerous banking institutions, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&T, and HSBC have also been victims. In addition, Iran has attacked Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s national petroleum and natural gas company. But while the U.S. and the rest of the world have concentrated on the illicit cyber-activities of expansionist regimes like China and rogue states like Iran and North Korea, there is a small but growing list of private cyber-actors—often supported by the aforementioned regimes—that has been largely ignored. While groups like the Chinese military’s PLA Unit 61398 are directly managed by nation-states, private actors are more difficult to combat. They cannot be held directly accountable or controlled in the same ways as state actors. Nor are they monitored properly by the nations and groups they target. When it comes to supporting these private cyber-actors, Iran appears to be one of the worst offenders. And this support could have terrible consequences. Since Iran may not have direct control over its cyber-proxies, it is possible for its leaders to deny or obfuscate responsibility for their actions, as it does with the terrorist acts of Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis. But cyber-proxies are, in the long run, a major threat to the West. And the longer we wait, the more powerful they will grow. Iran’s cyber-breakout was fast and sudden. Within the last few years, Iran has managed to build a cyber-capability that rivals the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Israel, who are the most dominant actors in cyberspace. According to intelligence documents released by Edward Snowden in 2013, Iran has been ramping up its surveillance of the United States government. One of these documents, written by Gen. Keith Alexander, former director of the National Security Agency, describes the threat as serious enough for the U.S. to request Britain’s assistance in containing the damage from Iran’s discovery of computer network exploitation tools—a technical term for cyber-weapons. Iran’s rapid development of its cyber-capabilities stems from the fact that it had an excellent, if inadvertent, teacher named Stuxnet. Stuxnet was a virus allegedly developed in 2007 by the United States and Israel. It was part of Operation Olympic Games, which sought to sabotage Iran’s nuclear weapons program. In another document leaked by Snowden, the NSA stated that Iran has demonstrated a clear ability to learn from the capabilities and actions of others, including from Western attacks against Iran’s nuclear sector. In other words, Stuxnet taught Iran how to use cyberspace to its advantage. Ever since then, Iran has invested heavily in developing its own cyber-capability. It has done so in order to protect against threats like Stuxnet and execute attacks of its own. The U.S. Army’s Strategic Studies Institute chronicled the rise of the Iranian cyber force last year: The latter claim has been substantiated by an Israel-based think tank, the Institute for National Security Studies, in its report on the matter. The relatively inexpensive nature of computers and the wealth of students who are easily trainable in the arts of cyber-warfare have made cyber-capability increasingly attractive to rogue regimes like Iran. In contrast to the Iranian nuclear program, which has drawn the attention of world powers and forced Iran to negotiate with the United States in order to gain relief from heavy sanctions, Iran’s cyber-force draws much less attention and cannot be monitored as easily as a nuclear program. Worse still, it seems that Iran’s surreptitious development of its cyber-capabilities will only expand. Ian Bremmer, president of the global consulting firm Eurasia Group and editor-at-large at Time magazine, recently tweeted, In 10 years’ time, Iran’s cyber capabilities will be more troubling than its nuclear program."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":468,"title":"China’s Military Built with Cloned Weapons","class":0,"body":"Historically, China has been a great innovator contributing inventions such as gunpowder, paper and the compass to human advancement. However, China has earned an international reputation in recent decades as being the home of a prolific copycat culture. The Chinese have become proficient at cloning products ranging from designer handbags and the latest smartphones to movies and alcoholic beverages. Fake Apple stores, counterfeit KFC restaurants and imitation IKEA big-box outlets dot the Chinese landscape. They have even built entire replica European towns. Some Western observers believe this cultural attitude towards imitation is rooted in Confucianism where followers traditionally learned by replicating masterworks and then tried to improve upon them. The fact that the Chinese commonly refer to today’s imitation products as Shanzhai indicates that they recognize the dubious nature of the current practice. The term Shanzhai translates to mountain stronghold and was originally applied to pirate factories producing counterfeit goods in remote areas beyond the reach of regulatory control. The copycat business is no longer restricted to outlying lawless regions. It has entered the mainstream and been embraced by government officials who seem content to allow other nations to develop products and technology which they can then acquire legitimately through licensing or illegitimately through counterfeiting and espionage. This approach allows China to stay competitive on the world stage while saving them the time and money it would cost to develop their own products. An industry in which Chinese cloning has excelled to a disconcerting degree is the manufacture of weapon systems. China’s expanding military and growing assertiveness has been bolstered by weapons cloned from the arsenals of other countries. Bleeding edge U.S. aircraft including the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Northrop Grumman X-47B unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) have Chinese counterparts that are remarkably similar. Some of the technology used in these designs was almost certainly acquired through a vigorous Chinese cyber spying campaign. U.S. Defense officials have stated that Chinese military hackers undertaking technical reconnaissance have succeeded in pilfering highly classified technical documents on a number of occasions. The sensitive technical data that is known to have been compromised is now evident in the latest versions of several Chinese weapons. Officials also suspect that China has managed to obtain valuable technical advances by making backroom deals with U.S. allies that bought American weapons. It is for this reason that the U.S. decided not to export the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. It is not only American weapon designs and technology that have been stolen and replicated by the Chinese. Russia has at times served as China’s unwitting research and development department. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia was in need of money and held a fire sale of its state of the art Sukhoi Su-27 fighter. China bought two dozen of the fighters but later negotiated for a license to assemble additional planes domestically using key components imported from Russia. Within a few years China claimed that the fighter no longer met their needs and canceled the contract. To the fury of the Russians, the Chinese soon debuted the indigenously built and equipped Shenyang J-11B fighter that looks identical to the Su-27. Russia continued to use Chinese money from arms sales to develop new technology, which China then stole. After several deals in which the Chinese quickly reversed engineered Russian weapons to produce their own versions, Russia finally wised up and began to reject Chinese requests to purchase single examples of their most advanced systems on a trial basis. To add salt to Russia’s wounds, China is now exporting knockoff weapons to the international market and undercutting Russia’s own arms trade in the process. But like a counterfeit Louis Vuitton handbag with a faulty zipper, Chinese clone weapons may be more style over performance. I think the big issue with all Chinese weapons – including copies of Western equipment – is that they remain untested in combat, Eric Wertheim author of U.S. Naval Institute’s Combat Fleets of the World and a naval analyst said. We just don’t know how they will perform, so while they may be far less expensive than their western counterparts, many countries are understandably reluctant to take the risk of acquiring products that haven’t passed the ultimate test of combat. I expect that some of these systems are likely to perform as advertised while others may significantly underperform compared to their western counterparts. Although Chinese clone weapons may not yet posses the quality and capabilities of the originals, several U.S. military and industry officials have expressed concern that the ongoing sophisticated cyber espionage campaign will allow China to rapidly improve their arsenal and even soon produce aircraft that will match all aspects of US fifth generation fighters like the F-22 and F-35."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":469,"title":"AMERICA BUILT A CYBER WEAPON TO PREEMPT NUCLEAR WAR WITH IRAN","class":0,"body":"Since the Soviet Union became the second nation with nuclear weapons in 1949, American presidents have tried to answer a very difficult question: how can they keep other countries from getting nuclear weapons, and can that be done without going to war. Responses have varied across the decades and administrations, with treaties and test bans shaping the process. It turns out that early in the Obama administration, when it appeared inevitable Iran would complete a nuclear weapon, the administration devoted resources to crafting a cyber weapon to halt the process, and they gave it a name straight out of a bad movie: Nitro Zeus. The revelations come from director Alex Gibney, who found evidence of the program while conducting research for Zero Days, a documentary about the tensions between Iran and Western countries prior to the nuclear deal negotiated last spring, and which entered into effect earlier this year. Zero Days was first shown today at the Berlin Film Festival. Several media outlets received advance materials from the film, including information from the trove of data that former NSA contractor Edward Snowden took with him when he fled the country. The plan, code­named Nitro Zeus, was devised to disable Iran’s air defenses, communications systems and crucial parts of its power grid, and was shelved, at least for the foreseeable future, after the nuclear deal struck between Iran and six other nations last summer was fulfilled. The Times notes that the plan included the effort to infuse Iran’s computer networks with 'implants' that could be used to monitor the country’s activities and, if ordered by Mr. Obama, to attack its infrastructure. From BuzzFeed News: The film’s sources said NITRO ZEUS involved hundreds of personnel over several years, and cost hundreds of millions of dollars — building programs ready to disrupt, degrade, and destroy Iranian infrastructure with code intended to leave no direct clues as to who was responsible for the attacks. NITRO ZEUS was not just some theoretical battle plan, Gibney reports. Operatives had already gained access to all the relevant systems to execute the attacks if the order was given, and checked back on a near-nightly basis to ensure all the access points were still live and operational, and that the attack code wouldn’t interfere with any other code on the systems, to reduce the risk of discovery — or accidental triggering. The number of implants in Iranian targets was reportedly in the hundreds of thousands. All of this describes a weapon built for an attack that stretches the very bounds of what counts as espionage and what counts as war. Much of what cyber deals with is infrastructure: the code and systems that power industrial projects, like power supply to nuclear reactors. We’ve already seen a similar practice in the works, with the Stuxnet computer worm created by the United States to target Iranian centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Nations treat acts of espionage differently than acts of armed conflict, and cyber plays into both. Sophisticated attacks on computer systems can steal information, disable systems, and in the case of Stuxnet cause actual, physical damage. Where is the line between hacking and war? The rules of war, agreed-upon norms roughly followed by most nations, don’t yet have a clear answer, but we have something close. The Tallinn Manual is a NATO-created body of legal scholarship that provides guidance, though no definitive answers, for how the law should treat hacking and cyberattacks related to war. In the fall of 2014, when former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich claimed a North Korean online attack on Sony was an act of war, scholars consulted the manual and found that the attack didn’t meet the threshold for war. To the best of our knowledge, Nitro Zeus has not yet been used, so we can’t examine an actual attack for context. Instead, the manual can indicate whether this is a shelved weapon or not. From the manual: An action qualifying as a ‘use of force’ need not necessarily be undertaken by a State’s armed forces. For example, it is clear that a cyber operation that would qualify as a ‘use of force’ if conducted by the armed forces would equally be a ‘use of force’ if undertaken by a State’s intelligence agencies or by a private contractor whose conduct is attributable to the State based upon the law of State responsibility. It appears Cyber Command, a military authority, put together Nitro Zeus, but even if it was just government workers employed by an intelligence service, like the NSA, or civilian contractors working or the government, using Nitro Zeus is probably, by this guidance, an act of war. Digging deeper into the manual, we get to the actual definition of an attack: A cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects. Conducted by an armed force, or at least on behalf of a government, it appears Nitro Zeus would have met the tentative guidelines for an act of war. There is some sense in the revelations about the program that the administration knew the implications of such an attack. The Times notes that presidential directives specify that only the president can authorize an offensive cyberattack, just as the president must approve the use of nuclear weapons."}

{"id":471,"title":"US Army Races To Build New Cyber Corps","class":0,"body":"WASHINGTON: The US Army is rushing to stand up cyber forces but its progress shows both how far we’ve come, and how far we have to go. From an initial start of six officers in 2014… today we have 397 officers, 141 warrant officers, and 560 non-commissioned officers and soldiers in the Army’s recently created cyber branch, the four-star Vice Chief of Staff, Gen. Daniel Allyn, told an Association of the US Army conference last week. That’s just over 1,000 specialists of all ranks. (Another 962 soldiers are in the related field of electronic warfare). West Point and ROTC graduated 30 new cyber lieutenants this year and will ramp up to 45. Many more cadets want to join, but the newborn branch’s training pipeline can’t yet absorb them all. It is not your typical (Army) classroom environment, said Col. Kenneth Rector, commandant of the Army Cyber School at Fort Gordon, Ga. They are small classes. Like most Army cyber troops, Rector started out in another specialty — in his case Military Intelligence — before transferring to the new cyber branch. That diversity brings varied perspectives, but it further complicates training. Both the diverse student body and the complex subject matter militate against a lecture-hall, mass-production approach to education. That said, production is ramping up. This year, Fort Gordon graduated its first Basic Office Leaders’ Course (BOLC) class of 21 officers. Next year, there’ll be multiple BOLC classes plus an Advanced Individual Training (AIT) course for enlisted personnel. In 2016, Rector said, Fort Gordon graduated 131 cyber operators; in 2017, the plan calls for 561. What sparked this growth? Back in 2014 — just two and a half years ago — then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel ordered the military to add 6,000 cyber specialists by 2016. Today, Army soldiers make up about a third of this Cyber National Mission Force. (The rest are Air Force and Navy/Marines). All of the 41 teams the Army was tasked to form are now operational, Army Cyber Command says. Some 11 are still building up to full strength — they’re at what’s called Initial Operational Capability — while 30 are fully manned and operational. Our no. 1 priority right now is to aggressively to defend our data, our networks, and our information systems, said Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, who commanded the National Mission Force until last month, when he took the helm at Army Cyber Command. What does Nakasone mean by defense? All the organizations we’ve mentioned report to Cyber Command, whose primary role is to defend the military’s own systems (collectively called) the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN). It’s civilian agencies like the FBI that protect civilian networks and critical infrastructure day to day. But CYBERCOM is always on call for backup if the civilians get overwhelmed. CYBERCOM would also lead any retaliatory cyber strike on Russia or other overseas adversaries beyond the reach of US law enforcement. Army Cyber is leading Task Force Ares, the all-service effort to hack the Islamic State, which uses the Internet for everything from propaganda to recruiting to command-and-control. Besides these strategic missions, the Army is also experimenting with tactical cyber teams, which would protect units’ wireless networks on the battlefield and attack their enemies’. 18 months of wargames have already convinced the service to add two cyber defense specialists to each combat brigade — over 100 soldiers Army-wide — and it’s studying 15-soldier teams for higher echelons. The Army’s also looking at its weapons systems, from tanks to helicopters to digital radios, to see which ones are vulnerable to hacking and might need urgent patches. With human error the pathway for most cyber attacks — clicking on a misleading link, opening a booby-trapped attachment, downloading a bad app — the most important thing that we’re focused on right now is training our soldiers to be as vigilant operating their equipment as they are when they get into the combat patrol, Gen. Allyn said. In short, there’s tremendous demand for cyber expertise just to defend the Army’s own digits, let alone the nation. And the Army has to compete for talent not just with the other armed services and civilian agencies, but with the private sector as well, which pays vastly better and doesn’t send you to be shot at. The military, however, can offer incentives that aren’t just financial. Besides the call to service, there’s also the fun factor of doing something you can’t do in civilian life. The good news is, for our cyber professionals,  they can do things in defense of our nation that would get arrested for in the outside world, said Allyn. That is very attractive."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":472,"title":"Virginia builds cyber foundation for government, business","class":0,"body":"When Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe took the chair of the National Governors Association, he chose to focus his tenure on cybersecurity, an area where his state has some expertise. Just one month after his inauguration in 2014, McAuliffe signed Executive Order 8, which launched the Cyber Virginia initiative and the Virginia Cyber Security Commission with the goal of building the cybersecurity infrastructure and economy in the state. Today, McAuliffe and others who were involved with the initiative can point to progress by way of new statutes, scholarships and research supporting cybersecurity. Speaking at an NGA conference in Boston earlier this month, McAuliffe said the reason for Virginia’s focus on cybersecurity is simple: The number of industry and government organizations located in the state make security paramount. We’re in a unique position, he said of Virginia. We have the largest naval base in the world, 27 military installations, CIA, Quantico, Langley, Oceana. So in addition to the state assets, we have a tremendous burden because of all of the military, defense and intelligence. The state can’t afford to have weak security with the amount of sensitive information it handles from public and private sector organizations, McAuliffe told GCN: Agencies and businesses located in Virginia want to know that the state is doing everything it can to secure their data and systems. We can’t be a weak link, he said. He told the conference that his initiative as NGA chair isn’t entirely unselfish, either. A state with weak cybersecurity can provide a backdoor to a more secure state if the two share a healthcare provider or other asset, he said. So the goal, he said, is to increase cybersecurity in all states. Virginia has worked to address cybersecurity in five areas: support security-based economic development, improve the cyberinfrastructure, reduce cybercrime, expand cybersecurity education and increase public awareness, according to Bob Day, who was the Virginia Cyber Security Commission executive director until the commission ended its work last year. Both Day and McAuliffe agreed that cyber education is fundamental to building a secure nation. One of the big problems in cyber is finding qualified people, Day said. It’s a chicken and egg thing. Without a pipeline of cybersecurity workers, the Commonwealth will be unable to protect its own computer networks or the state’s critical infrastructure. To address the workforce shortage, Virginia has increased the number of schools that offer federal cybersecurity programs, set up a cloud-based cyber range for schools that can’t afford to build their own and created scholarships for college students who agree to work for the commonwealth after graduation. Virginia Secretary of Technology Karen Jackson said metrics back up the investment in education. Northern Virginia [Community College] has more than doubled its enrollment over the last year in related cyber fields, Jackson told GCN. A tech-savvy workforce is also key to the economic development McAuliffe says could come from cyber. That’s why colleges in Southwest Virginia, which has been hit hard by the decline in coal, are interested in cybersecurity’s potential to help their local economy. Programs at University of Virginia College at Wise and New School Institute can help fill the 33,000 cybersecurity job openings in the Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia region, he said. The potential for cybersecurity-based economic development will be the best way for state CIOs and CISOs across the county to convince their legislatures and governors to invest in cyber, McAuliffe said -- adding that Virginia’s General Assembly was on board from the beginning. This legislative support resulted in many changes to state laws in the two years the commission has been at work, Day said. Agency heads are now responsible for their agency’s data security, computer crimes carry stiffer penalties and law enforcement can more easily access internet data. But if an executive branch is struggling with getting the legislature on board, McAuliffe said governors should consider executive orders. I would suggest all states do that, he said. You know, I can’t get everything done legislatively. Although Virginia has leveraged its technology ecosystem to raise its cybersecurity profile, it’s not the only state in good shape, Day said. But there are plenty of other states that have a long way to go and will directly benefit from the groundwork Virginia has laid."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":473,"title":" High-tech spies build civilian cyber industry","class":0,"body":"Years ago, veterans were not allowed to talk about the fact that they had worked at unit 8200, Israeli military’s legendary high-tech spy agency. But now, for founders of Israel’s cyber security ventures, being a former member of the unit has become something to openly brag about. In January Cyber Tech 2016, Israel’s largest digital security conference, was full of founders brandishing their connections to unit 8200. In my day we weren’t allowed to say we were coming from the unit. Now everyone does, every article is about it, it is so weird for me, says Natia Golan, director of product at BioCatch, a security start-up. An 8200 veteran herself, she finds it peculiar that the unit has evolved into a brand. Almost 70 security start-ups are founded each year, according to the IVC Research Centre. Many of them are created by young entrepreneurs trained by the Israeli military. Israel has tackled a severe shortage of experienced and qualified cyber security engineers in a unique way — by channelling bright kids into security at a young age as part of their compulsory military service. When they leave, many of them are keen to remain in a field that is booming thanks to a wave of funding from venture capitalists seeking to profit from the need to protect computer systems worldwide. This human talent is luring large multinationals such as IBM and PayPal to the country. Both the public and the private sector are now looking to capitalise on this success. They are keen to create enterprises to defend against increasingly sophisticated attacks which have ranged from data breaches in the US to recent strikes against Ukrainian energy suppliers. The Israeli government decided to prioritise cyber security four years ago as an enabler of the economy, says Eviatar Matania, head of the National Cyber Bureau at the prime minister’s office. The government has invested 100m shekels, or about $26m, in early stage start-ups and offers loans which do not have to be repaid if the company fails. Speaking like a Silicon Valley investor, Mr Matania says he is comfortable with such risky bets. When a Japanese delegation recently asked him what happens if companies do not succeed, he replied: Most don’t and it is OK, they just disappear. The centrepiece of the government’s digital security push lies 70 miles south of Tel Aviv, in the desert town of Beer Sheva. For now the Cyber Spark business park consists of a couple of generic blocks in the middle of scrub land including the offices of EMC and Deutsche Telekom, along with a lone outlet of Domino’s Pizza. But in the next few years, the Israeli Defense Forces plan to build a vast site which will include its military intelligence and cyber units. By placing the military’s cyber talent next door to businesses and the researchers at Ben Gurion university, the government hopes to bring together some of the country’s best minds in security. Jerusalem Venture Partners, Israel’s oldest and largest venture capital firm, has already established its own incubator for cyber security start-ups in the park. Yoav Tzruya, a partner at the firm, says it prides itself on being an active shareholder and moulding new ideas into globally successful companies. We insist that in the early stage, the companies are co-located in this facility here. So at the moment we are sharing the office with five other portfolio companies, he says. Once they have graduated, some may simply move across the street to the new WeWork shared office space that has opened in the town. Another organisation which seeks to act as a finishing school for turning military-trained cyber security engineers into entrepreneurs is Team 8, based in Tel Aviv and run by a former commander of the 8200. Its founder Nadav Zafrir says potential founders are often inspired by working closely to other people who have left the army and entered the security industry. They come out into the industry aged 23, 24, and the guys who are two, three, four years older have started their own companies,  he says. Some already have made fortunes. This is not a story in the FT, it is in the next room. This guy just exited for $300m, his company was bought by Microsoft, and you know what, he’s stupid, I can do better than him — I know the guy, I sat in the same room as him."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":474,"title":"SD aims to build cyber security cluster","class":0,"body":"In the wake of high-profile data breaches at Target and elsewhere, San Diego business leaders aim to promote the region as a hotbed for cyber security technology by tapping into military expertise that’s already here. The San Diego Regional Economic Development Corp. released a study today highlighting the region’s cyber security prowess. More than 100 cyber companies — along with the U.S. Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare System Command Center (SPAWAR) — employ about 6,600 workers locally and generate $1.5 billion in total economic impact. The EDC has teamed up with private firms, including anti-virus software maker ESET and information technology contractor Sentek Global, to create a Cyber Center of Excellence. The goal is to nurture a cyber security ecosystem to create jobs, similar to the biotechnology and wireless clusters that San Diego is known for. Three members of San Diego County’s congressional delegation, Democrats Scott Peters and Susan Davis and Republican Darrell Issa, are scheduled to speak at a news conference this morning announcing the initiative. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and Rear Adm. Patrick Brady, commander of SPAWAR, also are slated to attend. As we move forward, we really want to get people to recognize San Diego as a leader in cyber security, said Mark Cafferty, chief executive of the EDC. This gives us an opportunity to start with a growing sector that we know has an anchor in San Diego. About half of the region’s cyber security-related employees are at SPAWAR, the computer networking, engineering and communications arm of the Navy. With military budget cuts looming, cyber security is an area that’s likely to escape the worst of the budget ax. The Defense Department recently proposed a five-year cyber security budget totaling $23 billion. There is a need for businesses and the community to step up and help the Department of Defense capitalize on that investment, SPAWAR spokesman Greg Geisen said. It is not going to happen in one city or one town. The regions that are not paying attention are not going to capitalize. Those that stand together and show what they have to offer are most likely to benefit. San Diego isn’t alone in promoting cyber security as an economic engine. Much of the nation’s cyber security infrastructure is based around Washington, D.C., and Baltimore — the home of the National Security Agency, U.S. Cyber Command and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Computer Security Division, among others. Baltimore in particular has been aggressive in laying the educational, capital and marketing foundation to form a cyber security hub, which now employs about 75,000 workers in the Baltimore and Central Maryland area. Meanwhile, San Diego’s cyber industry suffered a blow when Internet security software firm Websense announced that it was relocating its headquarters — and 445 jobs — to Texas. Still, local officials say the time is right to position San Diego as a cyber security cluster, when massive data breaches grab headlines and technology trends such as remote computing and digital health care make network security a priority. Fifteen years ago, most hackers broke into networks simply to show off to fellow computer geeks. They did little actual damage. Today, experts say state-sponsored attackers and organized criminals are behind most incursions. They’re after credit card numbers, intellectual property and other valuable information. What we are seeing is the threat now shifting from being purely a problem for the government to being a huge problem for the private sector, said Andrew Serwin, a San Diego lawyer who worked with the EDC on the cyber security report. The region employs about 3,550 private sector workers in the cyber security field, according to the study. The CyberHive startup incubator and educational programs such as Securing Our eCity also have roots here. The San Diego Supercomputer Center located on the UC San Diego campus, coupled with Web security education programs at other universities, sets the stage for a cyber security cluster. But SPAWAR is the centerpiece. It employs 3,095 in the field locally, according to the study. It supports many private firms through information technology contracts. More than half of cyber businesses in San Diego list the federal government as a customer. SPAWAR has operations across the country, but San Diego is its largest location. It has research and development labs in Point Loma and Old Town. SPAWAR is being looked at as the beacon potentially for a lot of that cyber security innovation, said Sean Barr, vice president of the EDC. They are the second largest generator of intellectual property in our region behind Qualcomm. It is a significant opportunity for the Cyber Center of Excellence to leverage."}

The DDI is the result of a 90-day review of the CIA's organizational structure conducted earlier this year, which found that the agency needs to modernize in key areas, including embracing cyber capabilities and increasing training and leadership development. The new directorate is charged with advocating new technologies across the agency, creating a strategic framework for IT management, enabling innovation and developing training regimens, particularly around cyber. Digital Innovation became the fifth CIA directorate, along with the Directorate for Analysis, Directorate for Operations, Directorate for Science and Technology, and Directorate of Support. The agency also introduced 10 new mission centers on Oct. 1, mostly centered on geographic areas, though they also include centers for counterintelligence, counterterrorism and weapons and counterproliferation. The mission centers will act as central operation hubs connecting information and capabilities across directorates. Today, we mark a key milestone on the modernization journey that we started almost seven months ago, CIA Director John Brennan said on Oct. 1. Nevertheless, the modernization effort is about much more than changing the way CIA is organized; it is about how we work together every day to bring the best of the agency to the challenges we face. Brennan also noted other modernization efforts going on at the agency, including the Talent Center of Excellence and Executive Secretariat, both stood up in June. This kind of change will take time, he said. With our agency's new structure in place, we will follow through in the coming weeks and months by acting on critical feedback from the workforce and focusing on fundamentals."}

The units are scheduled to be stood up by the end of fiscal year 2019, according to information from the Guard. Our goal for cyber defense is to train, equip and provide highly skilled forces responsive to the needs of the nation, Army Gen. Frank Grass, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement. Working with the Army and Air Force, our cyber squadrons and teams will provide trained and ready soldiers and airmen to support requirements established by the services and U.S. Cyber Command. Seven new Army Guard Cyber Protection Teams will be activated across Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. They will join four previously announced teams in California, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan and Ohio. The Air Guard, in partnership with the Air Force, will activate four new Cyber Operations Squadrons in Idaho, Michigan, Texas and Virginia. In addition, a cyber information surveillance reconnaissance squadron will be stood up with California, and a cyber ISR group will be stood up in Massachusetts. These latest additions are part of the Guard’s efforts to lay the foundation for future cyber forces. This is the beginning, Air Force Col. Kelly Hughes, chief of the Space and Cyber Warfare Operations Division at the Air National Guard Readiness Center, said in a statement. This is a massive amount of force structure the Guard has laid into this mission, but this is just the first layer. By putting these new cyber units in the states listed above, the Guard will position cyber protection units in each of the 10 Federal Emergency Management Agency response regions. The focus is to get that presence in as many states as possible and especially making sure we have all the FEMA regions covered, Hughes said. This gives the states an additional asset, if needed, when it comes to large-scale emergencies and disasters at home."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":477,"title":"Army standing up cyber brigade, possible cyber branch","class":0,"body":"FORT MEADE, Md. (Army News Service, Sept. 5, 2014) -- The Army is activating a Cyber Protection Brigade today, and discussing a new cyber branch that could be established as early as next month. Command Sgt. Maj. Rodney D. Harris, Army Cyber Command, said the branch announcement could come as early as the second week of October, during the Association of the U.S. Army's annual meeting. The Cyber Protection Brigade is being activated by the U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command at Fort Gordon, Georgia. It's the first brigade of its kind in the Army and the nucleus of the new unit will be its cyber protection teams, according to the command.  Over the last two years, Army Cyber Command has been standing up teams at Fort Gordon and across the force with initial operating capability. However, the Army needs twice as many teams as it now has, Harris said. The Army needs to double the amount of Soldiers in the cyber career field, over the next two years, according to Harris. He said a conference in August focused on planning a new career management field for cyber warriors, which will be referred to as CMF 17. This conference at Fort Meade included key stakeholders from Fort Gordon, the intelligence field and the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Conference attendees discussed new military occupational specialties such as the proposed 17C cyber warfare specialist and the 17A cyber warfare officer. The 17 series will blend signal intelligence and military intelligence skills, Harris said.  These Soldiers are so unique, and they're so skilled and they're so few, Harris said. The chief of staff of the Army has asked us to focus hard on what we're doing for talent management to recruit and retain cyber Soldiers. That's why the Army needs a 17 series that will be just cyber, Harris emphasized. It takes three years of training to grow a network operations NCO, he explained. Two six-month courses are required, along with a two-year apprentice program, in order to be certified as a journeyman. There's very few other jobs in the Army -- in the non-commissioned officer corps, that require three years of training, Harris said. They are highly sought-after technicians. After serving a short tour, the network operations NCOs might go back to signal or military intelligence jobs, or on to higher-paid civilian positions. Harris said that wouldn't happen as often with establishment of a Cyber CMF. A package of re-enlistment incentives is also being staffed for cyber Soldiers, Harris said.  The number and sophistication of attacks on the nation's cyber networks is increasing, officials said, adding that's why it's important to have more effective and coordinated efforts for conducting cyberspace operations.  The Cyber Protection Brigade and cyber teams will help provide a more agile and responsive cyberspace force, officials said. The cyber teams will be roughly platoon-sized, but vary depending on their mission. The combat-mission or offense teams are larger, Harris said. The network defense or cyber-protection teams are mid-size. There are also support elements that are somewhat smaller and national teams that will support other government agencies, said Harris. The teams include Soldiers, NCOs, officers, warrant officers and Army civilian employees. We're not unlike any other maneuver elements, Harris said, explaining that the difference is his teams maneuver across the cyberspace domain instead of ground, air or sea. Weapon systems are all computers, Harris said. Any system connected to a network can be targeted by cyber teams, he said, and need protected by cyber teams. Many of our weapons systems today are enabled. If it's a computer system that's run by software - it can be targeted."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":478,"title":"Pentagon readies standup of regional cyber defense commands","class":0,"body":"The Pentagon’s newest cyber organization, Joint Force Headquarters-DoD Information Networks (JFHQ-DoDIN) is poised to take a key step in its maturation over the next several weeks as it branches out from Fort Meade, Maryland, and into three new branch offices designed to help defend DoD systems in various geographic areas. The first three provisional commands will be located in Europe, in the Pacific and in U.S. Central Command, and will be assigned to help combatant commanders in each of those areas secure their areas of cyberspace, said Brig. Gen. Robert Skinner, the deputy commander of JFHQ-DoDIN. Basically, they will be the forward element of the Joint Force Headquarters and supporting that commander’s in-theater requirements, he told AFCEA’s recent cyber defensive operations symposium in Baltimore, Maryland. They’ll still have a key relationship and linkage between the JFHQ proper, but they will in the combatant command’s battle rhythm, will understand the key cyber terrain, be able to provide situational awareness and be able to provide some operational planning support and capabilities for that combatant command. We’ll sit down with each command and walk through their requirements and figure out how we can synergistically work together to provide what they need to perform the missions they’ve been assigned in the Unified Command Plan. Sign up for Mike Causey's Open Season online chat with benefits expert Walton Francis on Nov. 16, at 11 a.m. The new headquarters was borne out of the notion that a separate organization was needed to oversee and coordinate all of the Pentagon’s network defenses and that those responsibilities should be tightly connected with the Defense Information Systems Agency, which manages the lion’s share of Defense networks. The organization reached its initial operating capability in January of this year, and is beginning to take over many of the day-to-day functions assigned to U.S. Cyber Command in the area of operating and defending DoD’s own networks. Along with the new responsibilities came new authorities. The DoD directive that created the new headquarters also created an organization that, for the first time, has the ability to order virtually any DoD component to take a given system offline if it’s deemed a threat to DoD’s overall ability to command and control its networks. While the new headquarters is mostly made up of former DISA employees and is commanded by the same military officer who serves as DISA’s director, the new authorities for the task force could represent a major change in network management for DoD systems or commercial systems connected to DoD networks. Eight months ago, DISA would have had a very tough time telling a service, ‘Hey, I’m going to shut you down,’ said Capt. Jeff Buss, the director of DISA’s command center. At this point, JFHQ-DoDIN has that power. I think we’ve taken a step in the right direction. The authorities also give the headquarters the ability to order any DoD organization to perform a variety of tasks in cyber, including incident response or to create any given cyber effect the headquarters might want to achieve, Skinner said. This has never been done before, he said. It used to be that we had a hodgepodge of working relationships. There was no authority behind it to make sure that someone was in charge if we couldn’t come to an agreement. That’s what we needed, because at the end of the day a risk shared by one is a risk shared by all. Many aspects of the DACO authority are still ill-defined at this point, said Col. Patricia Rinaldi, the director for strategy, plans and exercises at JFHQ-DoDIN. But in any case, she said the headquarters’ small staff of 190 personnel intended to use their new powers to achieve unity of effort for defensive cyber operations. We’re not looking to take over anyone’s network. We need to share the information and be a one-stop shop. So we need to have good communications between the DISA command center, the military services’ cyber components and also the DoD agencies, she said. Anyone who brings something onto the network, it’s going to be critical that we understand what those missions are and what those linkages are both inside and outside of the DoDIN."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":479,"title":"Navy Stands Up Cyber Security Task Force","class":0,"body":"The Navy has established a special new unit designed to protect computer networks and improve cyber security across the service called Task Force Cyber Awakening, or TFCA, service officials said. Created in August of this year, TFCA is a 100-person force dedicated to establishing protocols, identifying vulnerabilities, increasing cyber awareness and shoring up security and access with the Navy’s computer networks, service leaders explained. The genesis of this started several years ago when we started to see that the risk calculus associated with cyber was changing. If you look at risk and how we characterize risk with things like vulnerabilities, the consequences of exploiting those vulnerabilities and the actors, you’ll see that consequences are continuing to grow in cyber, Matt Swartz, lead for Task Force Cyber Awakening, told Military.com. The consequences associated with cyber-attacks are growing in part because weapons systems are increasingly relying on networks, creating a much larger cyber component to platforms and operations, he added. Combat and control systems are integrated. Years ago things were stand alone. Through modernization we’ve connected things like weapons systems and engineering systems to a network. A risk to one now is a risk to all, Capt. Kathy Creighton added. Iranian Attack According to a Wall Street Journal report in September 2013, Iranian hackers succeeded in penetrating into the Navy Marine Corps Intranet, an internal network used by the services for email and internal intranet functions. Although Swartz, Creighton and other Pentagon officials have not publicly confirmed that the hacking was done by Iranians, the WSJ report cites U.S. officials saying that Iranian hackers did penetrate into NMCI.  The report also says U.S. officials do not think any significant information was stolen from the unclassified NMCI network. The NMCI network has more than 700,000 users at more than 2,000 different locations. The hackers were able to penetrate deep into the network through some of the Navy’s publicly accessible websites, the WSJ report said. Swartz acknowledged the intrusion, without specifying any perpetrators, and said the new task force is looking at implementing lessons learned from the U.S. military response to the incident – an effort called Operation Rolling Tide. Over the last several years we have seen a lot more aggressive actions on the part of adversaries. We responded to that NMCI incident and when we looked at that we realized we could not just piecemeal our response. We started doing assessments across our enterprise, Swartz said. Operation Rolling Tide involved a vigorous effort to secure government databases and improve the overall security protocols for Navy computer networks. Operation Rolling Tide was broad. We wanted to make sure we could respond rapidly to those types of incidents in the future, not only to detect them but to respond to them. We took the lessons that we learned and looked across business and tactical networks, applying those principles to all those enterprises within the Navy, Swartz added. Task Force Cyber Awakening Mission The TFCA is interested in establishing integrated cyber policies and procedures governing access and use of Navy networks. At the same time, the special task force is hoping to prioritize protections and identify which parts of the Navy’s many networks are most crucial to operational functioning and missions – in the event of crisis. The realization came to us that you can’t protect the entire enterprise at the same level. Ultimately, there are hard trade-offs that you are going to have to make. There is probably a subset of our enterprise that is no-kidding critical to the warfight, Swartz explained. At the same time, the TFCA is working to better understand and protect network and combat system connectivity in light of rapid cyber-related technological progress. Some of the anticipated measures sought after by the task force include improving what’s called cyber-hygiene, effort to create secure passwords and better user practices. We’re not just talking about firewalls, routers and sensors but we are talking about taking our traditional navy cyber apparatus – operations, defense, inspections and all the different parts. We’re saying this is not just going to be the traditional C4ISR networks and SIPRNet (Secret Internet Protocol Router Network). We want to extend that apparatus to the whole of Navy’s networks. This includes combat systems, control systems and platform IT, Creighton said. Creighton said representatives from all five naval systems commands are participating in the TFCA such as Naval Air Command and Naval Sea Systems Command. There is also involvement from Fleet Forces Command as well as the Pacific Fleet and other areas of the Navy, she said. Improving cyber situational awareness and better understanding how networks share information with one another is an essential element of the task force’s agenda, Creighton added. These efforts can include a number of hardware-related technical solutions designed to protect or better fortify boundaries between systems. We’re creating configuration management and embedding capabilities within our networks. If someone can penetrate through your boundaries you want the ability to detect them. This is about providing technologies that can detect that type of maneuvering within our space and providing technologies that allow you to mitigate what’s happening, Creighton said. Having a common operational picture or an improved ability to monitor networks allows cyber-experts to better identify anomalous behavior, she said. The TFCA is also invested in training sailors and creating a more cyber-savvy and cyber-aware culture within the Navy. Part of our task force is looking at how we make every sailor and civilian also a cyber-security sentry? How do we get them trained up? This is something that we all have a responsibility for, Creighton explained."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":480,"title":"NATO Should Stand Up Black Sea Command Before Itâs Too Late","class":0,"body":"Recognizing the need to provide the Department of Defense a cohort of technical operators in the face of growing threats and increasing activities by adversaries in the cyberspace domain, the Army approved the Cyber branch in the Fall of 2014. Allowing for current servicemembers to transfer in and the accession of newly commissioned, warrant officers, and enlisted soldiers, the branch must balance the need for cyber technical expertise while growing its own leadership as cyber leaders will serve in complex, uncertain, and contested environments.[1] The Army Capstone Concept states one of the Army’s greatest competitive advantages resides in its ability to learn faster and adapt more quickly than its adversaries.[2] With increasing rates of technology changes, lowered costs, and enhanced dissemination to the lowest level of actor and adversary, leaders throughout all branches must remain imaginative, adaptable, and innovative.[3] Maneuvering through cyberspace in support of strategic objectives and Unified Land Operations requires cyber leaders to develop into agile and adaptive leaders who are flexible, critically reflective, and comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty.[4] The Army’s Cyber Branch must prepare leaders to improve competence in their technical requirements, remain operationally focused, seek lifelong development, and possess an entrepreneurial mindset through the application of learner-centric, adult learning models in the classroom to meet the needs of the Army as it defends the nation. This article first develops and defines the vision of cyber leaders and then discusses how to educate those leaders. CYBER LEADER VISION Cyber leaders set conditions to enable operations and empower commanders at all echelons to accomplish their mission on land, sea, and air. Grounded in doctrine, policy, laws, and authorities, cyber leaders must effectively apply their technical expertise in the joint, interagency, intergovernmental, multinational environment to maneuver through cyberspace and support operations across all domains. Moreover, while much of what the Army’s Cyber branch accomplishes is technical, leading teams within the cyber force still requires focusing organizations towards a  purpose, making work productive, and understanding the social function of management.[5] Within the U.S. Army Cyber School, the Cyber Leader College encourages the growth of competent, operationally focused, developing, and entrepreneurial leaders for the force through its educational offerings. BREAKING THE C.O.D.E Competence: The Army Leader Development Strategy recognizes that the pace of technological change requires the Army to develop leaders who are proficient in cyberspace.[6] As the Cyber branch, leaders must set the tone for competence in the technical arena, maintaining competency in technology trends while continuing to possess a foundational understanding of common core Army operational tasks. The speed of technological change combined with the nearly ubiquitous access to information challenges the cyber leader to anticipate and adapt faster than the Army’s adversaries to maintain the competitive edge required on today’s battlefield.[7] Soldiers with the 780th Military Intelligence Brigade conduct cyberspace operations during a training rotation for the 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif., Jan. 24. The Fort Meade, Md.-based 780th was one of several cyber organizations that took part in the rotation as part of an pilot program to designed to help the Army develop how it will build and employ cyber in its tactical formations. (U.S. Army Photo) Operational Focus: Cyber leaders must leverage the larger Army and defense enterprise, which integrates maneuver in cyberspace with the other forms of maneuver to deny the enemy’s ability to conduct operations in cyberspace while preserving U.S. freedom of action.[8] As such, cyber leaders must ensure their organizations embrace its essential tasks and focus on overall commander’s intent and mission goals. Integration of cyber and electromagnetic effects as part of the operation combine[s] technologies across several domains, compelling the adversary to face multiple, simultaneous predicaments while enabling Joint Force mission accomplishment.[9] Development: Army education occurs at defined periods in a leader’s career. The complex and ill structured challenges presented in the operating environment requires leaders to continue to educate and train themselves and their subordinates between mandated professional military education opportunities across all branches.[10] Cyber leaders must first develop their foundational understanding of Army and Cyber operations in the classroom. Once experience and education create expertise in Army and Joint doctrine, cyber leaders must leverage creative approaches to continued development—from broadening education and industry opportunities to a disciplined approach to reading and the pursuit of technological projects to further expertise in current topics. Moreover, cyber leaders must ensure subordinates recognize that career-long learning is essential to development.[11] Emphasizing sustained development creates cyber leaders who continue to grow and gain knowledge of the complex environment in which the Army operates. Entrepreneurship: Cyber leaders must detect and then exploit opportunities as well as anticipate, articulate and manage change within organizations while accepting prudent risk to achieve the objective.[12] Operating in a domain that outpaces acquisition, typical organizational change, human capital management policy development, and—sometimes—even planning, cyber leaders must anticipate future demands, stay ahead of determined enemies, and accomplish the mission by innovating new tools or methods.[13] Leaders must accept risk in the face of bureaucratic obstacles to innovation and effectively communicate the requirements to effect change.[14] The entrepreneurial spirit meets those demands through a blend of risk taking, initiative, imagination, and creativity in and out of organizations.[15] Cyber leaders will either have that spirit naturally or must find ways to foster it internally and in others to succeed in the complex environment they face."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":481,"title":"Lynn: Cyber Command Stand-up a Milestone","class":0,"body":"Deputy Defense Secretary William J. Lynn III called the stand-up of U.S. Cyber Command a milestone in the ability of the United States to conduct operations in cyberspace. During the ceremony on Friday, Gen. Alexander received his fourth star, now that he has been confirmed as the head of CYBERCOM. CYBERCOM is the latest in the growing effort by the United States to better secure its networks, Lynn said. It is a sub-Combatant Command of Strategic Command and is responsible for cybersecurity across Department of Defense networks. We want to be able to maintain those advantages and protect the military missions, and that is the main mission of Cyber Command – it is to protect the military networks, Lynn said. It will have a role, though, in protecting the government’s networks and critical infrastructure. The new command takes the current capabilities and centralizes them, according to Lynn. It will be the place where the Department of Homeland Security will come to on cybersecurity matters, he said. And it will help rationalize the interagency process. The government is still working to see how the United States might respond in the event of a major cyber attack and what role the military might play in helping to defend U.S. networks in the event of such an attack. We’re in the midst of a series of meetings the White House is leading to work through a lot of those legal issues, Lynn said. We’ve made progress organizationally, industrially and internationally, but the legal regime in particular is an area we need to tackle further. Our ability to predict where the threats are coming [from], even in conventional threats, is remarkably poor, he added. We didn’t see Desert Storm coming. We didn’t see the series of events that led to Afghanistan. Foreseeing the threats in cyberspace is harder. With Cyber Command, I think we need to be prepared for the unexpected."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":482,"title":"UK Asks NATO to Stand Up to Russia","class":0,"body":"A committee of UK lawmakers has warned that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is not well prepared to face the new threat posed by Russia and many deficiencies are dogging its command structures. It seems the Ukraine crisis has exacerbated concerns among NATO allies on the preparedness of the military alliance to safeguard member states in the event of an attack. The Commons Defence Committee in the UK observed that the Ukraine conflict has exposed serious deficiencies in NATO's preparedness and called for radical reforms to plug the loopholes. Though the MPs do not see a conventional assault, overt methods such as cyber-attacks and irregular militias can be significant. Security for Baltic states The UK Defence committee called for increased presence of NATO troops and military equipment in vulnerable Baltic states such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. It also wanted NATO to amend its Article 5 and add unconventional threats such as irregular militia and cyber-attacks as triggers to undertake its missions to defend member states when they come under an attack. In a report, the panel made the observation that NATO looks ill-prepared to face the Russian threat against NATO member states. Rory Stewart, chairman of the committee, said the risk of a Russian attack on NATO member state may be small but it is significant. Russia has been changing its tactics. There are cyber-attacks, information warfare, irregular separatist groups, armed civilians and forces without insignia. Russia has tried all these in Ukraine to destabilise a NATO partner and annex part of its territory to pulverise the ability to respond. The report wanted NATO to factor in Russia as a territorial threat on the basis of the recent events. The events in Ukraine, cyber attack on Estonia and invasion of Georgia in 2008 are wake-up calls for NATO. They also revealed glaring deficiencies in the NATO's preparedness. NATO clarifies NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said all these points were touched upon by the NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen in recent times. She said the Wales NATO Summit in September will be an occasion to discuss them threadbare. To reinforce collective defence for the eastern allies, NATO has already augmented the air, sea and land force capabilities."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":483,"title":"Kaine asks if Trump would stand up to Russian cyberattack","class":0,"body":"Erie, Pennsylvania (CNN)Sen. Tim Kaine leaned further into the role of vice presidential attack dog Tuesday, suggesting Donald Trump wouldn't stand up to a potential Russian hack of the American election. The Virginia Democrat also hit Trump for not releasing his tax returns or disclosing business ties to international entities, suggesting the billionaire is hiding something. When candidates are on the up and up, they have no problem disclosing this information, Kaine said at a Pennsylvania organizing event here on the shore of Lake Erie. Trump's hiding something, and the only question is what. Hillary Clinton's running mate cast doubt on Trump's intentions, accusing him of having a cozy relationship with Russia. Don't you think the American voters deserve at least to get to the bottom of why Trump's relationship with Russia is so cozy? he asked. We have no idea how he might stand to profit from Russia or what they might be holding over him. Kaine called into question Trump's willingness to stand up to Russia in the event of a potential cyberattack on the American election, saying Trump has encouraged Russia to already get in and screw around with our elections. Just imagine if Russia were to engage in a cyberattack to destabilize the American electoral process, as it has done with other nations. Would President Trump stand up to them? Well you know, we actually know the answer to that one already, because Trump has publicly encouraged Russia to commit espionage and hack his political rivals, Kaine said, referencing remarks Trump made at a press conference in July. When he was challenged on it, he said, 'Well, I was just trying to be funny.' That guy has a weird sense of humor -- encouraging Russian cyberattacks on the American political process? Wow, that's just a laugh riot, isn't it? Kaine said. A message left with Trump's campaign Tuesday afternoon was not immediately returned. Kaine, assuming a typical running mate's role in leading attacks against the opposition, has stepped up his criticism of Trump in recent days. Last week, he said Trump was pushing the values of the Ku Klux Klan. He backed away from the comments a day later, telling reporters that Trump has some supporters connected with the KKK who are claiming him."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":484,"title":"China's Xi opens refinery with Saudi King Salman","class":0,"body":"Riyadh (AFP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping and Saudi King Salman on Wednesday inaugurated a joint-venture refinery, symbolising Beijing's deepening involvement in the Middle East and Riyadh's need for economic diversification. The event took place in the Saudi capital on the second day of Xi's first visit to the region. He later left for Cairo and will also travel to Saudi Arabia's rival Iran. The YASREF refinery, in Yanbu Industrial City on the Red Sea, is 62.5-percent held by Saudi oil giant Aramco, while China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec) holds the balance. YASREF represents both companies' focus on driving downstream growth, the refinery said in a statement. Billboards on a highway outside the ceremony showed Xi and Salman waving against a backdrop of the refinery. Saudi Arabia is China's biggest global supplier of crude, and state-owned Saudi Aramco says expansion into refining and chemicals fits the kingdom's goal of economic diversification. The policy has been given added urgency by a plunge in the kingdom's oil revenues. YASREF is one of five joint-venture refineries in Saudi Arabia. Another four are overseas, including one in Fujian, China. The YASREF refinery shipped its first diesel one year ago and has a capacity to refine 400,000 barrels of Arabian crude per day. Saudi Aramco and Sinopec also signed a framework agreement on cooperation, reflecting confidence in the potential opportunities we can create together, said Saudi Aramco president Amin Nasser. - Growing trade - Sinopec's strengths in refinery and chemical technology would support the kingdom's drive to diversify its petroleum sector, said the company's chairman Wang Yupu. The ceremony, accompanied by a Chinese dragon and Arabian sword-dancing, took place in Riyadh at the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC). Salman separately inaugurated that facility, which focuses on energy research and policy. Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi, who chairs KAPSARC's board of trustees, told the gathering the centre would contribute to the diversification and expansion of the Saudi economy. Salman in December said he had ordered economic reforms to diversify sources of income and reduce the kingdom's high dependence on oil. Global crude prices have collapsed from above $100 a barrel in early 2014 to below $28 on Wednesday. To cope with a record budget deficit, the kingdom broke with its decades-old generous welfare system and raised fuel, electricity and other prices in its 2016 budget. Government spending has also been cut, there is talk of a value-added tax in the tax-free nation, and state assets including Saudi Aramco could be privatised. Trade between the Gulf nations and China, the world's second-largest economy, has been growing. Two-way commerce between China and Saudi Arabia alone reached $69.1 billion in 2014, according to China's official Xinhua news agency. Although China depends on the Middle East for its oil supplies, it has long taken a low-profile approach to the region's diplomatic and other disputes, only recently beginning to expand its role, especially in the Syrian crisis. Before Xi's visit, a Chinese analyst said Beijing would do what it could to ease heightened tensions between Saudi Arabia, the region's main Sunni power, and its Shiite rival Iran. Later, Xi was welcomed at Cairo airport by his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, with whom he will hold bilateral talks that focus on the economic sector. Bilateral trade between China and Egypt amounted to $11 billion in 2014, the bulk of it being Chinese exports to the biggest Sunni Arab country, state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported. On Thursday, Xi is to visit Egypt's newly convened parliament, and will address a session of the Cairo-based Arab League."}

Upon arrival at the venue, the Chinese president was received by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. He was also received by Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz, Governor of Riyadh region; Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Second Deputy Premier and Minister of Defense; Prince Saud bin Abdullah bin Thinayyan, President of the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu, and a number officials. The attendees watched a video on Yanbu Aramco Sinopec Refining Company Project (YASREF). Addressing the gathering, Eng. Khalid Al-Faleh, Director of the Board of Saudi Aramco, described the event of opening the project as historical and unique as it would add a new edifice to the partnership between the Kingdom and China. He recalled that the project attracted the region’s largest economy and the world’s second largest. He expressed pride that Aramco is China’s first supplier of oil. Al-Faleh said Aramco has first invested in Fujian refinery in China, an ideal project in all terms while the two parties are today dedicating a new venture in Yanbu, a project that has created 6,000 job direct and indirect opportunities. He disclosed that the working team of the project won Plats international prize as the best project in 2015, noting the unlimited support of the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Al-Naimi and Prince Saud bin Abdullah Al-Thinayan, President of the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu. He pointed that there is a good chance to create a qualitative leap in all aspects of cooperation in the field of energy, citing three areas: first: the development of economically feasible and sustainable investments in the field of refining and marketing, thus supporting China’s strategy to achieve supplies security and doubling of Saudi petroleum to China, second: is based on building of partnerships between the two countries within the silk road economic zone initiative launched by the Chinese President Xi Jinping making the Kingdom a basic core of this initiative, and the third: focused on supporting the joint cooperation between the two countries in the fields of research, education, knowledge technology, innovation and cultural activities, noting that Aramco has opened a research center in Beijing while Sinopec lays tomorrow the foundation stone of a research and development center in Dhahran. He pointed that the cooperation memoranda of understanding which were signed yesterday between the two countries’ governments, build on those initiatives and embody the keenness of the two leaderships to push their partnership to higher levels, extending the most sincerest thanks to the Custodian of the To Holy Mosques and the Chinese President for honoring the opening of this industrial edifice. Then the Custodian of the To Holy Mosques and the Chinese President watched a live transmission from the central control room of the project in Yanbu and co-dedicated it. Then the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques bade farewell to the Chinese President.

The function of the Centre is to ensure centralisation of protection of cyberspace at national level. The changing security environment highlights the need for cyber security. Experience shows that the number of cyberattacks in the country is increasing, while their effect on people’s lives may grow even further. The National Cyber Security Centre opened today strengthens its capabilities, cooperates closely and provides assistance to other institutions in private and public sectors, Minister of National Defence J.Olekas said at the inauguration ceremony. As Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevičius said at the inauguration ceremony, the official opening of the National Cyber Security Centre came at a particularly right time, that is, after the NATO Summit in Warsaw where major focus was given to ensuring cyber security. The NATO Heads of States and Governments recognised cyberspace as one more defence domain, such as land, sea or air, and allied countries agreed to enhance their cyber security and resilience. The National Cyber Security Centre was established in the territory of the General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania a little over a year ago, by now it has been manned to roughly 80%, equipment has been installed and infrastructure readied. According to Minister J.Olekas, since the establishment, experts of the Centre have achieved a lot in strengthening cyber security of Lithuanian state institutions and advising citizens who administer their cyber systems on their own. The staff of the Centre are normally the first ones to detect attacks on state institutions and to inform about them, to help manage a cyber incident, and to coordinate actions of different institutions. Cyber incidents that are tracked by the experts working at the Centre take place across all networks and systems, and their number annually increases by roughly 20%. Specialist of the Centre we inaugurate today are ready to protect and defend networks and systems from cyber-attacks at any time of the day, Head of the National Cyber Security Centre Rimtautas Černiauskas. Within its capacity, the National Cyber Security Centre looks for cyber security solutions in the fields of state information resources and critical information infrastructure in cooperation with state authorities and organisations and other entities. The event was also attended by Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevičius, Chairman of the Committee on National Security and Defence of the Lithuanian Parliament, Artūras Paulauskas, Minister of the Interior Tomas Žilinskas, Minister of Transport and Communications Rimantas Sinkevičius, Ambassadors of Estonia, Latvia, the United States, and Poland, and other guests. The Law on Cyber Security of the Republic of Lithuania, in force as of 1 January 2015, provided legal basis and enshrined the will to protect the cyberspace of Lithuania through combined efforts. The Service for Cyber Security and Telecommunications under the Ministry of National Defence was tasked with the functions of the National Cyber Security Centre defined by the said law. Lithuania takes cyber security seriously: this year the National Plan for of Cyber Incident Management organisational-technical requirements for cyber security, and other legislation regulating cyber protections obligatory to all public sector institutions have been endorsed this year."}

{"id":489,"title":" MIT Lincoln Laboratory helps inaugurate the Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security ","class":0,"body":" The first-ever workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS) was held on 12 February as part of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence's (AAAI) annual conference in Phoenix, Arizona. Members of MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Cyber Security and Information Sciences Division—David Martinez, William Streilein, and Kevin Carter—teamed with Arunesh Sinha, a colleague from the University of Southern California, to organize and chair the workshop. AICS assists analysts in dealing with the deluge of cyber data to more rapidly reach decisions and actions, enabling us to keep pace with the rapid increase in cyber threats, said Martinez, associate head of the Cyber Security and Information Sciences Division. James R. Clapper, U. S. Director of National Intelligence, has called the intelligent cyber adversary the number one threat to U.S. security. Accordingly, Lincoln Laboratory has named cyber security and autonomous systems as two of the top thrusts for its own research agenda. The AICS workshop aligns directly with these Laboratory mission areas and aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from both fields in an environment that fosters collaboration and furtherance of novel capability development, said Streilein, who leads the Cyber Analytics and Decision Systems Group at the Laboratory. The workshop focused on ways to improve cyber security capabilities through the research and application of artificial intelligence technologies, including machine learning, game theory, natural language processing, knowledge representation, and automated and assistive reasoning. The workshop is unique in that it specifically approached the cyber security problems from an AI perspective, explained Streilein. Solutions were considered that would incorporate machine assistance and intelligence from the outset, and therefore have the best promise of dealing with problems of volume, velocity, variety, and veracity—the big data problems that go beyond human capabilities. The workshop featured two invited keynote speakers, a panel discussion, and nine peer-reviewed papers on topics related to the cyber threat, human-machine interaction, and cyber situational awareness. George Cybenko, a professor in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, opened the workshop with a keynote address on the application of AI to cyber security problems. In his afternoon keynote presentation, Robert Laddaga, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Vanderbilt University, reviewed the future of AI and cyber security. Dr. Laddaga’s keynote was interesting for its vision of the future of cyber security, which will inevitably include AI solutions in response to an adversary who is leveraging AI for nefarious purposes, said Streilein. The workshop concluded with a panel discussion that focused on the impediments to acceptance of AI within the cyber security community. Among the panel experts were Richard Lippmann, an MIT Lincoln Laboratory Fellow; Vern Paxson, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley; Milind Tambe, a professor at the University of Southern California; and Benjamin Rubinstein, a researcher from the University of Melbourne. Each panelist brought a different perspective to the problem, yet they found many common challenges and recommendations for paths forward, said Streilein, who served as moderator for the panel. While the panel determined there is a place for AI in cyber security operations, they cautioned against using AI without fully understanding it. Because of the 2016 workshop's success, the AAAI conference committee asked that the AICS workshop be repeated next year, perhaps with an expanded agenda. Potential themes for next year include a special focus on human-in-the-loop systems and lessons learned from analogous research areas, such as biology.  Looking forward, the AICS workshop will continue to bring together diverse areas of expertise to help deal with the rapidly evolving cyber security landscape, said Streilein, who added, As workshop chairs, we hope visitors left with a sense that cyber security is an important national concern that needs novel solutions to augment human capabilities and that AI can have an important role to play in creating solutions."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":490,"title":"Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu Inaugurates Advanced Technologies Park, National Cyber Center","class":0,"body":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday inaugurated a new high-tech park in the southern Israeli town of Be’er Sheva named Advanced Technologies Park, which will house several major tech firms and serve as a National Cyber Center, housing computer-related Israel Defense Force divisions. We need to see to [our] security. This is our first obligation, as well as mine as Prime Minister, and this is a challenge for us because the reality around is challenging, Netanyahu said in a statement. In the end, our lives depend on an iron wall. We are building an iron wall, an Iron Dome, and we have an iron will. These are the things that give us the strength to defend ourselves and also to tell those who would attack us: It is not worth your while. These are the fundamentals that protect the State of Israel. Everything else is happening here now, Netanyahu said. The world around us is changing quickly and the amount of knowledge is increasing geometrically. This knowledge has created new challenges but also new opportunities and cyber is the greatest area that is happening here, and we are a force in it. We are bringing Israel’s cybernetic strength here to Be’er Sheva, the prime minister said. The 20-building park, to be built over 49 acres, with 2 million square feet of office and lab space, plus an equal amount of space for the IDF facility, was designed by KUD International LLC, a subsidiary of Japan-based Kajima Corporation, one of the world’s largest development and construction firms. According to the Prime Minister’s office, the goal of the project is to build a world-class technology center, leveraging the academic support of nearby Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, IDF computer units, and the involvement of private industry. In 2011, several Israeli and international high-tech companies moved to temporary facilities in the development to guarantee their spaces in the first building, which was dedicated in June, 2013. High-tech firms in the first building include ECI Telecom, JVP, NESS, EMC, Elbit, Gefen Dekel, DBMotion and Deutsche Telekom, in conjunction with Ben-Gurion University. The IDF team focusing on cyber events is known by the acronym CERT – Computer Emergency Readiness Team. The CERT will be established within the cyber complex and will be the first national government agency to be based in Be’er Sheva. The national cyber center will also supply the necessary knowledge for cyber studies in formal and informal education, as well as assist private enterprise in commercializing their technology. The Israeli government has allocated NIS 40 million ($11 million) over the next three years for companies that establish cyber innovation centers in Be’er Sheva. Last month, Netanyahu and Israel’s Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon visited the Negev to tour what will become a new IDF training complex outside Be’er Sheva, which will cost 21 billion shekels ($5.92 billion) to complete. The IDF’s Communication Corps compound will be transferred from Herziliyah to the new Negev complex next year. The IDF’s Intelligence compound is set to move to the Negev in 2018, and with it, 30,000 personnel, of which 6,000 are career servicemen. The Computer Science division will also makes its way to the Negev. In parallel to the technology and military developments in the area, a non-profit group called OR Movement is helping to develop Carmit, a 2,600-home planned community for Israelis who want to live near the new technology campus."}

The Seminar, designed to broaden the horizons of military knowledge in terrorism and its impacts among top level and middle grade officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Police has been themed under the personal and close supervision of the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Crishanthe De Silva, in close cooperation with the Major General Jagath Alwis, Commander, Army Training Command (ARTRAC) at Diyatalawa and Brigadier Ralph Nugera, Commandant, OCDC who has been the live-wire behind its realization with the participation of more than 150 participants, including several civil experts as contributors. Major General Milinda Peiris who presented an overall picture of emerging terrorist trends at global level and the need for modernized approaches with novel counter-measures warned that the Army needed to be alert to the sensitivities connected to possible re-assembling or resurgence of terrorist groups and overseas activists who would still be promoting ideological perception while working against Sri Lanka’s economic and development aspirations. We need to be knowledgeable to face any future challenges considering transnational effects of terrorism and this type of unique forum would help you to expand your intellectual capacities since all of these themes are thought-provoking. We are living in fast changing environments which are highly complex. We also need to be knowledgeable on the spheres of human rights and fundamental rights in a broader manner, the Chief Guest added. Modern day threats are also complex. Production of a biological weapon at a small laboratory could be done faster than making a weapon. We got to think big and be prepared for any eventuality through our own tailor-made initiatives. We can have our own preventive and deterrent solutions without going only by theoretical aspects alone. Therefore, education is the most important experience that an officer could get, he added. Major General Milinda Peiris was received on arrival by Brigadier Ralph Nugera, Commandant, OCDC and conducted to the main conference hall where the formalities, like oil lamp lighting and remembrance of fallen War Heroes took place. Among other participating senior officers were Major General B.A Perera, Director General General Staff (DGGS), Major General Jagath Alwis, Commander, ARTRAC, Major General A.P De Z Wickramarathne, Commander, Security Forces - Central and a host of Majors General, Brigadiers, Colonels, Majors and Captains.

{"id":492,"title":"EU launches cross border cyber crime taskforce","class":0,"body":"The European Union will commence a six-month pilot of a cyber crime unit charged with investigating cross-border attacks perpetrated by botnets, banking Trojans and the darknet. The Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) will start in September and will be headed by Andy Archibald, deputy head of the UK's National Cyber Crime Unit. J-CAT will be housed at the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in The Hague, with its board comprised of senior figures from EC3, the FBI, the NCA and Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office. Cyber crime police investigators from across Europe will reside permanently at the centre and will be charged with building criminal cases. They will co-ordinate investigations with other countries including Australia, Canada and Columbia. The European Union's own European Cybercrime Task Force (EUCTF) – which comprises the heads of cyber-crime units from all the EU member states as well as Europol, Eurojust and the European Commission - will monitor progress of the pilot. We're really testing this out as a learning exercise, Paul Gillen, head of operations at the European Cyber Crime Centre, said. The more you practise at doing something the better – and luckier – you get at doing it. We're pushing an open door; the cyber crime investigation community agree that this is the only way they can work. We will have to suck it and see. We will have some success and some failures along the way, but we must work together if we are to make the internet a safe place. Should the pilot prove successful, the eventual aim would be to accommodate investigators from all 28 EU member states. Specific terms on the principles of the group are currently being drafted. We don't have too many rules at the moment; we will probably discover issues as we go along and address them, Gillen said. He hopes the centre will go some way toward the better policing of cyber crime, but noted that investigators would have to overcome traditional policing views, as the internet has no borders. The traditional form of policing just doesn't work. We have to think and work differently. Alan Woodward, a professor at the department of computing at the University of Surrey and academic adviser to EC3, said the move made a ‘great deal' of sense given EC3's emergence as a centre of excellence. He said permanent investigators would give member states the opportunity to ‘absorb' information on the ground and take it back to their own countries. There's an opportunity for [investigators] to absorb some practicality on the ground and take it back and do it locally, Woodward said. He also praised the ability for investigators to work together when based out of the same building - one of the key things in cyber crime is better intelligence sharing. Andy Archibald and the NCA could not be contacted for comment at the time of writing."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":493,"title":"U.S. Navy Starts Alternative Fuel Use","class":0,"body":"The U.S. Navy commenced the use of biofuel as part of its regular operations on January 20 when Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack witnessed the deployment of the USS John C. Stennis Carrier Strike Group. The Great Green Fleet is a Department of the Navy initiative highlighting how the Navy and Marine Corps are using energy efficiency and alternative energy to increase combat capability and operational flexibility. At the close of the ceremony, the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Stockdale left the pier to begin its deployment, becoming the first U.S. Navy ship running on an alternative fuel blend as part of its regular operations. The blend fueling the Carrier Strike Group’s surface ships contains alternative fuel made from waste beef fat provided by farmers in the Midwest. It was purchased at a cost-competitive price through a partnership between the Department of the Navy and U.S. Department of Agriculture aimed at making alternative fuel blends a regular part of the military's bulk operational fuel supply. A focus on energy and energy-saving technology gives the U.S. Navy a military advantage, Mabus said. An amphibious assault ship like the USS Makin Island, which uses a dual electric-diesel propulsion system, can stay on station three times longer than a conventionally powered vessel. It gives us an edge tactically; it gives us an edge strategically. It keeps … fuel from being used as a weapon against us. When it comes to power, my focus has been about one thing and one thing only: better warfighting, said Mabus. The Great Green Fleet shows how we are transforming our energy use to make us better warfighters, to go farther, stay longer and deliver more firepower. In short, to enable us to provide the global presence that is our mission. Stockdale is the first surface combatant to receive alternative fuel as part of its regular operational supply. Following the ceremony, Mabus and Vilsack flew out to the destroyer USS William P. Lawrence to witness it replenishing its tanks with alternative fuel from fleet replenishment oiler USNS Guadalupe. The remainder of the Carrier Strike Group's surface ships will receive fuel from fast combat support ship USNS Rainier, which will take on over three million gallons of the alternative fuel blend in Washington State before joining the carrier strike group on deployment. The advanced fuel blend was produced by California-based AltAir Fuels from a feedstock of beef tallow - waste beef fat - provided by Midwest farmers and ranchers, and traditional petroleum provided by Tesoro. Pursuant to Navy requirements, the alternative fuel is drop-in, meaning it requires no changes to ship engines, transport or delivery equipment, or operational procedures. The Defense Logistics Agency awarded a contract to AltAir Fuels for 77.6 million gallons of the alternative fuel blend, at a cost of $2.05 per gallon, making it cost competitive with traditional fuel. Sailing the Great Green Fleet in 2016 was one of the five energy goals Mabus set in 2009 for the Navy and Marine Corps. It was named to honor President Theodore Roosevelt's Great White Fleet, which helped usher in America as a global power on the world stage at the beginning of the 20th Century.  The Great Green Fleet will usher in the next era of Navy and Marine Corp energy innovation, said the Navy in a statement. Symbolism and Skepticism Mark Cancian, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former White House budget official, said the initiative is as much about environmental symbolism as cost savings or tactical advantage. Many congressional Republicans objected three years ago when the Navy sought and won support for defense subsidies to help three private firms build biofuel refineries. With oil now selling around $30 a barrel, that skepticism remains. They have not changed their position, which is that these are too expensive and not needed, Cancian said. The Defense Department uses about 14 million gallons of fuel a day, with the Navy responsible for about a quarter of that, according to figures from the Defense Logistics Agency. When the Navy first tested biofuel versions of marine diesel and jet fuel in 2012, it spent eye-popping sums for small amounts. In one case it paid $424 a gallon for 20,055 gallons of biofuel based on algae oil. In another it spent nearly $27 per gallon for 450,000 gallons of biofuel, later mixed into a 50-50 blend. The $15-per gallon-cost was four times the price of conventional fuel at the time."}

{"id":495,"title":"World Bank Group Launches Sudan’s Evidence Base and Data Literacy Program","class":0,"body":"KHARTOUM, January 17, 2016 — The World Bank launched the Sudan Evidence Base and Data Literacy Capacity Development Program. Funded by UKAid, delivered by the World Bank, and drawing on expertise from both organizations, the program – the first of its kind in Sudan – is meant to improve development outcomes through stronger evidence-based policy-making, program design, and monitoring.  This capacity development program commenced on January 10 and will continue through the coming eight months.  There is a recognizable need for reliable data in Sudan, said Igbal Khalid of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. We are pleased to start the first statistical and data literacy training course, which is the result of close collaboration between the Ministry of Finance, the World Bank and UKAid. I would also like to thank the World Bank for making possible this initiative toward building a strong economic model for Sudan. Good quality and reliable statistics and highly skilled statisticians are prerequisites for better and more targeted policy-making to respond to needs of the public – in particular the poor and marginalized – to ensure that no one is left behind.  The need for reliable evidence in fragile states such as Sudan is perhaps greater than anywhere else, toward the achievement of meaningful solutions to complex problems.  Through helping to close capacity gaps in data analysis, use, and re-use, as well as encouraging the adoption of a culture of data use for more inclusive social development and economic growth, the Sudan Evidence Base and Data Literacy Capacity Development Program aims to enable government statisticians at the national and subnational levels to increase the quality and accessibility of official statistics and contribute to the achievement of such solutions.  The program is unique because it brings together data producers and data users -- including journalists, civil society, and academe – to transform complex public data into knowledge, to learn how to analyze data, and make it relevant for government decision-makers, and understandable to the public. This initiative is timely, said Xavier Furtado, World Bank Country Representative to Sudan. In the coming months we expect to see the preliminary results of the National Baseline Household Survey and we know the government will move forward with preparing its full poverty reduction strategy. This kind of capacity is therefore essential. We understand that changes will not happen overnight. But, in addition to better quality data, the Worl Bank hopes that the Evidence Base Program will contribute to greater transparency and accountability in how public policy is debated and decisions are made.  The Sudan Evidence Base and Data Literacy Capacity Development Program builds on earlier World Bank assistance for improved data in Sudan and reinforces the Bank’s commitment to robust data generation and analysis as a driver of the global knowledge economy and to catalyze informed public policy and debate."}

It would aim at saving critical infrastructure such as sensitive database of banks, railways, power industry, telecom and AADHAR from cyber attacks or hacking. The cyber security experts of IIT-Kanpur would assist the Central government so that the database of the country facing vulnerability from hackers in Pakistan and China does not fall in their hands or other foreign governments. The experts believe that in the cyber age, threat from arms and ammunition is less in comparison to the cyber attacks. IIT-K director Indranil Manna said, The senate of the institute had last month approved the setting up of a cyber security centre, where a team of faculty members would be engage in cyber security research. The idea of setting up a cyber-security centre was proposed by Sandeep Shukla of computer science and engineering department. Any of the critical systems such as the financial system, power generation/transmission/distribution systems, railway system, manufacturing and logistics management system, air traffic control system are subject to cyber attacks and require measures in defending them, detecting on-going cyber attacks, attribution of attack sources and prevention of attacks by taking preemptive measures. Protection of critical infrastructure from cyber attacks is matter of concern for most of the nations and same is the case with India. We would provide solutions to safeguard the sensitive data of national importance, said Shukla. Citing example of July 30 and 31 in 2012, when entire North India, North East India and East India had plunged into darkness owing to malfunction in the grid, Shukla said that power grid had tripped, affecting a major part of the country but this had then happened due to technical glitches. The same situation can be repeated by hackers and it could be an induced one and not a malfunction. They can actually hack the power generation/transmission/ distribution network, he elaborated. Citing another example of cyber attack on Iran, Shukla said that in 2009, Iranian nuclear plant was attacked by some foreign entity. As Iranians were not prepared for this worst scenario, they could not realise for a while that they have been cyber-attacked. Talks are on with National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre in Delhi for assisting us in the making the most advanced cyber security lab. Also talks are going on with Prime Minister Office (PMO), home ministry, department of science and technology about the importance of this centre and also for the funding. The centre is expected to start functioning in next 4-5 months, Shukla said. The cyber expert also mentioned that the Centre for Cyber Security and Defence of Critical Infrastructure at IIT-Kanpur will collaborate with Tel Aviv University and Bengurian University in Israel as they are experts in cyber security. Senior professor of IIT-K Manindra Agarwal, who is also the part of the centre, said, Cyber security and defence centre will undertake research in cyber security, educate and train students through undergraduate and graduate courses and also engage in consulting the critical infrastructure sector and the government."}

The new program will operate through Bugcrowd – a crowdsourcing bug bounty platform with a community of over 32,000 registered security researchers. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles values engaging third party researchers to improve our products, making them safer and more reliable, read the company’s Bugcrowd page. We have committed to formal recognition and compensation for discovery of reproducible and legitimate vulnerabilities, provided they are disclosed responsibly. Our goal with the Bug Bounty project is to foster a collaborative relationship with researchers to participate in responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities in FCA’s vehicles and connected services, said FCA. The auto giant said it would investigate legitimate reports and make every effort to correct any valid vulnerability as quickly as possible. As part of the program’s responsible disclosure guidelines, FCA noted it would not take legal action against researchers participating in the program provided their compliance.

In recent years, automakers are realising that hackers just like Charlie and Chris are already at the table, ready and willing to help, and are leveraging the work coming out of this community to make their products safer from cyber threats, Ellis added. Fiat Chrysler joins automakers Tesla and General Motors, who launched similar programs earlier this year. According to WIRED, Tesla has paid as much as $10,000 to hackers who reported vulnerabilities in its vehicles.

{"id":500,"title":"US Govt launches pilot cyber defense program with ISPs, defense firms","class":0,"body":"Faced with a growing threat from hacking and other cyber crimes, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have joined hands with leading ISPs and private defense contractors to launch a pilot program called DIB Cyber Pilot that will help strengthen their network defenses. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn, in his address at the 28th Annual International Workshop on Global Security, told the audience in Paris, that the move was prompted by the growing cyber threat and dangers they face everyday. Lynn said the U.S. government has not forgotten the 2008 cyber attack. [F]or all the military capability that information technology enables, it also introduces vulnerabilities. We learned this lesson in 2008 when a foreign intelligence agency used a thumb drive to penetrate our classified computer systems—something we thought was impossible. It was our worst fear: a rogue program operating silently on our system, poised to deliver operational plans into the hands of an enemy. Moreover, the threat continues to grow, posing new dangers to our security that far exceed the 2008 breach of our classified systems. Lynn said. Lynn said the cyber defense program, which was started last month, does not involve monitoring, intercepting, or storing any private sector communications by the DOD and DHS. It only shares the DOD's classified threat intelligence with defense contractors and their private Internet service providers (ISPs), along with the know-how to employ it in network defense. The threat intelligence provided by the government is helping the companies themselves, or the Internet-service providers working on their behalf, to identify and stop malicious activity within their networks, Lynn said. The ISPs include AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink while the defense contractors include Lockheed Martin, CSC, SAIC and Northrop Grumman, according to the Washington Post. This is not the first time the U.S. government has collaborated with private companies to strengthen their network defense. Through one pilot program launched last year, the DHS shares threat intelligence information with some private-sector CIOs and cyber security officers to help them protect their networks. However, the program has struggled to achieve the right balance and to disseminate information in a way that satisfies all stakeholders. The new pilot program breaks new grounds on several fronts, Lynn said. By establishing a lawful and effective framework for the government to help operators of one critical infrastructure sector defend their networks, we hope the DIB Cyber Pilot can be the beginning of something bigger, Lynn said. It could serve as a model that can be transported to other critical infrastructure sectors, under the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security. Lynn has classified the hack attacks into three categories: [1] Suspected government-backed hacks of military and private sector networks: Example are security breaches that were possibly backed by government agencies at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Lockheed Martin, Google, NASDAQ, and Citibank. The French Finance Ministry and European Commission had also suffered major intrusions in recent months, Lynn said. [2] Crude but disruptive attacks on networks from hacking groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec: Examples are distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) in recent years on the government of Estonia and Georgia and companies like PayPal and eBay. In recent months Sega, Sony, Nintendo, Bethesda, PBS and Fox.com as well as the US Senate, the CIA, and FBI were also attacked. [3] Destructive attacks targeting critical infrastructure and military networks: The most dangerous cyber threat, according to Lynn, as they seek to destroy the functionality of weapons systems and critical infrastructure such as the networked IT that prevents nuclear meltdowns or manages sewage treatment. The first form of cyber attack, Lynn said, does not have the dramatic impact of a conventional military attack but in the long term it has a corrosive effect that in some ways is more damaging. It blunts our edge in military technology and saps our competitiveness in the global economy, he said. The second form of cyber attack is carried out by loosely organized hacking groups pursuing independent political goals or even simply engaging in wanton acts of destruction for their own amusement and satisfaction. The disruptive attacks we have seen are relatively unsophisticated in nature, largely reversible, and short in duration, Lynn said. But in the future, more capable adversaries could potentially immobilize networks on an even wider scale, for longer periods of time. Though Lynn did not cite any example of the third form of cyber attack, one cannot forget the zero day attack that took place last year. A Stuxnet worm, which used a Microsoft Windows Shortcut LNK/PIF vulnerability and other zero-day exploits to target Siemens supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, snarled Iran's power facility at Bushehr. In April this year, another worm called Stars, caused havoc on Iran's nuclear power plant. Some believe that Stuxnet worm originated in the U.S. or Israel and was possibly made by a government agency."}

[It] certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica's ice is just going up and up, Walt Meier, a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, told CNN. Scientists previously attributed Antarctic ice gains to natural fluctuation in the atmosphere. Simply put, weather at the poles can be erratic – that’s why researchers are hesitant to say that recent southern ice loss is reflective of a trend. But while it’s too early to say for sure, new lows could indicate a longer pattern of melting in the region. The timing of northern lows has also concerned researchers. It is currently polar night in the Arctic, which means much of the region receives no sunlight at all. During the time between October and November, ice over the Arctic Ocean thickens and grows as a result of sub-zero temperatures. But these months have been unusually hot this year, preventing much of that freeze. That could cause significant meteorological changes down the line, even outside the region. Shifting Arctic climates can affect the polar vortex, which spills cold air into North America, Europe, and Asia. Consequently, any change in the polar vortex could change the frequency and intensity of winter storms on those continents. Climate scientists have warned about polar ice melt for decades. It now looks likely that 2016 will be the hottest year on record, and the effects of that warming are perhaps the most apparent in the North Pole. In October, researchers at NASA noticed a new warming trend in the extreme north. Weston Williams reported for The Christian Science Monitor reported: Not only is seasonal ice melting into the ocean, but the older ice that has remained constantly frozen, sometimes for decades, is also showing signs of significant thinning. The oldest ice in the Arctic has traditionally served as a line of defense against warming, protecting the northern ice cap's integrity through normal seasonal changes. But as the ocean continues to warm, so does the polar cap, leaving the future of the Arctic ice uncertain. In May, Arctic ice melt was several weeks ahead of where it had been in previous years, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. That record low wasn’t set by a small margin, either – there was a discrepancy of more than 500,000 square kilometers of ice, compared to the previous record low in 2004."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":502,"title":"Something really crazy is happening in the Arctic","class":1,"body":"Sea ice in the Arctic has been trending at record low levels since the third week of October — and now, something really crazy is happening up there. The Arctic is heading into the dead of winter, and across a vast swath of territory, the polar night has descended, with 24 hours of darkness each day. This is when temperatures should be plunging, and sea ice should be expanding rapidly. Instead, temperatures are soaring, and sea ice is actually shrinking. This shouldn’t be happening. To be clear, sea ice is growing in some areas. But since Nov. 16th, the overall trend has been downward. That’s largely because sea ice has been contracting significantly in the Arctic Ocean adjacent to the island archipelagos of Svalbard and Franz Josef Land. You can watch it happen in the Tweeted animation above, and also in the animation at the top of this story. Both are based on data acquired by the AMSR2 instrument aboard Japan’s GCOM-W satellite. What the heck is going on? Against the backdrop of human-caused global warming — a phenomenon that has caused the Arctic to warm twice as fast as any other region on Earth — the region is having a particularly difficult time cooling down this winter. As Bob Henson puts it in an in-depth story titled Crazy Cryosphere at Weather Underground’s Category-6 blog: Temperatures north of 80°N smashed records for warmth throughout the winter of 2015-16. Now they’re on an even more torrid pace. Here’s one way to think of what’s happening: Natural variation has long brought both cooler and warmer than average temperatures to the Arctic in all seasons. But now, we humans are putting our finger on the scale, tipping the balance in favor of excess warmth. And right now, we’re talking crazy warm: In the map above, the brightest red tones are indicative of temperatures that are more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal. For areas of the Barents Sea near Svalbard and Franz Josef Land, that has meant above freezing air temperatures near the surface. A complex set of factors seems to be at play. Back in August, two large storms in the Arctic helped break up sea ice and may have stirred up warm water from the depths, according to Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. This helped drive Arctic sea ice to a near-record-low in September. In fact, record lows have been set for Arctic sea ice on 160 days so far this year, according to Zack Labe, a PhD student studying Arctic climate at the University of California at Irvine. This means vast swaths of the ocean surface were exposed to sunlight for a longer period than normal. Ice is very effective at reflecting solar energy. But dark surface waters absorb it readily. So water already warmed by the stirring action of the storms was able to get warmer still, thereby hindering formation of sea ice. Now, those waters are giving off some of that energy to the atmosphere, probably accounting in part for the unusual air temperatures at the surface right now. At the same time, atmospheric circulation patterns have been pumping warm air into the region from the south, apparently slowing the cool-down of ocean waters. The result: a truly bizarre situation in the Arctic. Meanwhile, a large portion of Eurasia has been crazy cold and snowy. You can see this in the blue and purple colors in the temperature anomaly map above. As Bob Henson of Category-6 explains: It’s as if the hemisphere’s entire allotment of chilly, snowy weather has been rounded up and consigned to one area, albeit a big one. For this, we can credit or blame what’s called a wave one pattern, where the upper-level circulation around the North Pole is dominated by a single elongated loop, shunted in this case toward the Eurasian side. Meanwhile, at the other pole, Antarctic sea ice is also trending at record-low levels."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":503,"title":"How Climate Change Has Put The North Pole In A Serious Crisis We Can't Ignore","class":1,"body":"With everything that's happened in the United States over the last couple of weeks, there's no shame in admitting if you're feeling a little preoccupied. Indeed, plenty of people have been walking around as if they're still in a dream they can't quite wake up from, with President-elect Donald Trump now already making cabinet appointments for his incoming administration. But there's another story happening right now, and one that's of no less existential importance ― the North Pole appears to be stricken by climate change, and is now far warmer than it's supposed to be as the winter season approaches. How much warmer, you ask? A lot. As Chris Mooney and Jason Samenow detailed for the Washington Post, the temperature at the North Pole right now is about 36 degrees Fahrenheit above where it should be based on previous years, resulting in slowed sea ice-freezing over the polar seas. Needless to say, amid the intensifying urgency to address climate change for so many coastal and island locales across the world, and considering the United States just elected someone who once tweeted that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, these are pretty frightening times. It's no more reassuring when you see the North Pole's temperature visualized in chart form ― to the contrary, the abnormality and potential calamity of this moment are that much more apparent. It's important to note, as the Washington Post report does, that ice is still building up in the seas around the North Pole, but it's happening at far slower pace that it normally would. It's also true that this could be some kind of momentary fluctuation that could remedy itself, at least quickly enough that it wouldn't necessarily be an omen of something truly dire and unforeseeable happening. But that's all cold comfort considering that something bad definitely is happening, it's just a matter of how quickly. The overwhelmingly scientific consensus on human-caused climate change is overwhelming for a reason ― both because the science behind it holds up, and because of the indicators all around us that it's taking place. That's why the current state of political affairs is so harrowing, as well ― assuming Trump's climate change denial can be taken seriously, his election could mean that the U.S. will pull out of the Paris climate agreement, a move which would have disastrous international and environmental implications. When you get right down to it, there have seldom been so many things to worry about all at once."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":504,"title":"The North Pole is an insane 36 degrees warmer than normal as winter descends","class":1,"body":"Political people in the United States are watching the chaos in Washington in the moment. But some people in the science community are watching the chaos somewhere else — the Arctic. It’s polar night there now — the sun isn’t rising in much of the Arctic. That’s when the Arctic is supposed to get super-cold, when the sea ice that covers the vast Arctic Ocean is supposed to grow and thicken. But in fall of 2016 — which has been a zany year for the region, with multiple records set for low levels of monthly sea ice — something is totally off. The Arctic is super-hot, even as a vast area of cold polar air has been displaced over Siberia. At the same time, one of the key indicators of the state of the Arctic — the extent of sea ice covering the polar ocean — is at a record low. The ice is freezing up again, as it always does this time of year after reaching its September low, but it isn’t doing so as rapidly as usual. In fact, the ice’s area is even lower than it was during the record-low 2012: Twitter’s expert Arctic watchers also are stunned. Zack Labe, a PhD student at the University of California at Irvine who studies the Arctic, tweeted out an image on Wednesday from the Danish Meteorological Institute showing Arctic temperatures about 20 degrees Celsius higher than normal above 80 degrees North Latitude. Today’s latest #Arctic mean temperature continues to move the wrong direction . . . up. Quite an anomalous spike!, Labe wrote. Here’s the figure: As you can see, temperatures north of 80 latitude were around -5 degrees Celsius — still below freezing, but not by that much — instead of the normal of around -25 degrees C. Despite onset of #PolarNight, temperatures near #NorthPole increasing. Extraordinary situation right now in #Arctic, w/record low #seaice, added Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. This is the second year in a row that temperatures near the North Pole have risen to freakishly warm levels. During 2015’s final days, the temperature near the Pole spiked to the melting point thanks to a massive storm that pumped warm air into the region. So what’s going on here? It’s about 20C [36 degrees Fahrenheit] warmer than normal over most of the Arctic Ocean, along with cold anomalies of about the same magnitude over north-central Asia, Jennifer Francis, an Arctic specialist at Rutgers University, said by email Wednesday. The Arctic warmth is the result of a combination of record-low sea-ice extent for this time of year, probably very thin ice, and plenty of warm/moist air from lower latitudes being driven northward by a very wavy jet stream. Francis has published research suggesting that the jet stream, which travels from west to east across the Northern Hemisphere in the mid-latitudes, is becoming more wavy and elongated as the Arctic warms faster than the equator does. It will be fascinating to see if the stratospheric polar vortex continues to be as weak as it is now, which favors a negative Arctic Oscillation and probably a cold mid/late winter to continue over central and eastern Asia and eastern North America. The extreme behavior of the Arctic in 2016 seems to be in no hurry to quit, Francis continued. Francis cited the work of Judah Cohen, a forecaster with Atmospheric and Environmental Research, who has linked odd jet stream behavior with cold air over Siberia. Indeed, another Arctic expert, James Overland with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that the jet stream at the moment is well configured to transport warmth northward into the Arctic. There is strong warm advection into the Arctic, especially northern-central Canada, in through the Atlantic, and east Siberian/Chukchi Sea, Overland said. The whole situation is pretty extreme, several experts agreed. Both the persistence and magnitude of these temperature anomalies are quite unusual, Labe added by email. Large variability in temperatures is common in the Arctic (especially during the cold season), but the duration of this warm Arctic — cold Siberia pattern is unusual and quite an impressive crysophere/sea ice feedback. (The cryosphere refers to that part of the Earth’s system that is made up of ice.) Abnormally warm air has flooded the Arctic since October. Richard James, a meteorologist who pens a blog on Alaska weather, analyzed 19 weather stations surrounding the Arctic Ocean and found that the average temperature was about 4 degrees (2 Celsius) above the record set in 1998. Since November, temperatures have risen even higher. It is amazing to see that the warmth has become even more pronounced since the end of October, James wrote on his blog. Mark Serreze, who heads the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., agrees that something odd is going on. Not only are air temperatures unusually warm, but water temperatures are as well.  There are some areas in the Arctic Ocean that are as much as 25 degrees Fahrenheit above average now, Serreze said. It’s pretty crazy. What’s happening, he explains, is sort of a double whammy. On the one hand, there is a very warm underlying ocean due to the lack of sea ice forming above it. But, at the same time, kinks in the jet stream have allowed warm air to flow northward and frigid Arctic air to descend over Siberia. The sea ice is at a record low right now, for this time of year, that’s one thing, Serreze said. And why it’s so low — again, there’s so much heat in the upper ocean in these ice-free areas, the ice just can’t form right now. The ocean’s just got to get rid of this heat somehow, and it’s having a hard time doing so. The situation this winter could set the Arctic’s ice up for very thin conditions and a possible record low next year, Serreze said, although it’s too soon to say. The weather in the Arctic can change swiftly. Temperatures could cool and the ice could rebound. But the record-low sea ice extent and unprecedented warmth in the region fit in well with recent trends and portend even more profound changes in the coming years."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":505,"title":"Deep Cold: Interior and Northern Alaska Weather & Climate","class":1,"body":"Arctic-Wide Warmth The extraordinary warmth across the Arctic basin in October prompted me to take a closer look at historical temperature data to get a sense for the magnitude of the recent anomalies.  I first did a search for stations with reasonably complete monthly data since 1971, and then I selected 19 sites that lie on or near the coast and also fall within 2000km of the Arctic Ocean's pole of inaccessibility (marked with an X below).  The spatial distribution of the 19 sites is reasonably even around the Arctic Ocean. The chart below shows the mean temperature anomaly for these 19 stations in each October since 1971.  Remarkably, the 19-station mean temperature in October 2016 was 5.6°C above the 1981-2010 normal and more than 2°C above the 2012 record.  October 2016 was the second most anomalous calendar month in the data since 1971 - only January 2016 was warmer relative to normal, at 6.5°C. Looking at recent daily temperature anomalies for the same 19 stations, it is amazing to see that the warmth has become even more pronounced since the end of October; the 19-station mean anomaly reached 9.6°C last Thursday (November 3), and on Friday the coolest of the stations was 5.4°C warmer than normal.  In terms of standard deviations, Thursday's mean anomaly was the highest of any day from 1971-present. Here's the 19-station daily mean temperature for 2016 on an absolute scale rather than an anomaly scale.  Only 7 out of 311 days have been cooler than the 1981-2010 normal, and then only by a fraction of a degree."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":506,"title":"This new weather satellite isn’t just good for the U.S. — it’s good for the world","class":1,"body":"At 6:42 on Saturday evening, the United States launched a revolutionary new weather satellite into space from Cape Canaveral, Fla. When GOES-R arrives at orbit, it will see hurricanes and blizzards with higher resolution than any other U.S. satellite of its kind. The scans will take less time and be transmitted faster. Severe storms will be more predictable through breakthrough lightning mapping. The weather satellites that silently monitor the atmosphere over North America are approaching the end of their life spans. If they fail, the United States will be left without critical weather data. Scientists at NOAA and NASA have been warning of this risk for years. In the late 1990s, they began designing instruments for the next generation of satellites. GOES-R, the first in the new series to launch, will join a large constellation of U.S. satellites — operated by NOAA, NASA and the Department of Defense — that observe our planet’s weather and environment. It is a game-changer for weather forecasting, but it’s also part of a bigger picture. GOES-R joins an international network of satellites that share data freely among nearly 200 countries. The United States provides data to other nations so they can generate precise forecasts and alert people to prepare for weather events. In turn, those countries share their data with the U.S. National Weather Service. Advance notice of crippling blizzards, long-range hurricane forecasts — even a severe thunderstorm outlook — is possible because of the freely-provided weather data from Europe, China and Russia. It is a mutual understanding based on an unspoken tenet: Our well-being is important, and so is yours, and we can’t do this without one another. The notion of sharing weather information dates to the late 1800s, when the knowledge was essential for maritime activity. More than a century later, an unfathomable amount of weather data is shared among 191 governments as members of the World Meteorological Organization, or WMO, an agency of the United Nations. The organization’s role became crucial after the United States launched the first weather satellite in 1961 and other countries followed suit. That’s one of the big things that’s changed in my lifetime, said Richard Rood, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Michigan. The U.S. was originally the only global network, and then the Europeans, Japan and India all started launching their own satellites. We had to develop a data-sharing agreement. The international Space Age prompted WMO leaders from the United States and the U.S.S.R. to create a World Weather Watch program that allows any country to receive any meteorological data it needs to protect life and property. Global satellite data is critical to that objective. It is the backbone of forecast models, or numerical weather prediction. More than 90 percent of the data ingested by the models comes from satellites around the world. People don’t think about why forecasting has improved, said Cliff Mass, a professor of meteorology at the University of Washington. If you look at the revolutions that made forecasting possible, numerical weather prediction is one of them, and satellites were the other. They measure how the atmosphere is flowing — its wind speed and direction — based on how clouds move over time. They can see long-wave radiation escaping from the ground and oceans, which is directly related to the temperature and moisture through the depths of the atmosphere. That information, along with ground-truth observations from thermometers and weather balloons, is used as a starting point for the forecast. And it can be used to nudge the model back to reality if it gets off-track. Perhaps the most significant recent example of the satellite network’s role in weather forecasting was Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. After the storm took a disastrous left turn onto the East Coast, researchers at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts sought to determine how critical satellites were to its accurate prediction. Without the information from polar-orbiting satellites, which can observe the entire globe in 24 hours, the forecast would have given no useful guidance 4–5 days ahead that the storm would make landfall on the New Jersey coast, the study concluded. This goes beyond simply forecasting for the public, said Rob Masters, the director of external relations for the WMO. It’s a key source for long-term forecasting and in various sectors of our economy, the environment, health and transportation of all kinds. There have been times when nations have threatened leave the partnership, said Rood, a consultant for the National Weather Service’s next generation forecast who’s been involved in weather and climate modeling for decades. Eventually, he said, governments would realize how severely it would degrade their forecasts. When I was working at NASA, every now and then some country would say they wanted to pull out their [weather balloons], Rood recalled. We would do experiments to look at the impacts, and also to show the impacts if we pull ours back, too. If you start withholding, you don’t just punish them or us, you punish everybody. The WMO nations don’t just share data — they also have a history of sharing spacecrafts. In 1989, the satellite that monitors the East Coast failed, leaving NOAA with just one satellite over the Pacific Ocean. Replacements for the aging satellites were in the works, but the project was years behind and millions of dollars over budget. So in 1993, the Europeans moved one of their Atlantic ocean satellites farther west to fill the gap. The year before, that same European satellite had been able to help meteorologists track and forecast the deadly Hurricane Andrew, which devastated Florida. And the courtesy extends in both directions. Before joining WMO, Masters worked in the satellite division of NOAA. He recalled that in 2002, the United States lent its GOES-9 satellite to Japan after their west Pacific satellite began run out of fuel. They had a failure, and they were blind, Masters said, so we worked it out so one of our satellites could move over there. With the addition of GOES-R, the United States will have four satellites parked over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to monitor weather in North America. But the new generation bears only slight resemblance to the old. The camera instrument on GOES-R — called the Advanced — doubles the resolution of the current NOAA satellites. It can scan the whole hemisphere in five minutes, and if there’s a particularly dangerous weather pattern approaching, forecasters can scan a smaller region over the United States every 30 seconds. Sudden bursts of lightning could mean thunderstorms are becoming severe. So, GOES-R has a lightning mapper to continuously monitor and transmit all of the lightning strikes across North America and the surrounding oceans. All of this data will be fed into weather models to improve forecast accuracy. It could extend the lead time of tornado warnings and predict the location of flash flooding before it begins. In other words, it could save more lives not only in the United States, but abroad. GOES-R is expected to go live in 2017. When it does, it will feed critical, lifesaving data into National Weather Service forecasts. It will also enter a decades-long tradition of international cooperation and humanitarian goodwill. This is probably the most complex technology that our species is involved in — weather prediction is, Mass said. And we do it together as one species. It’s one of our greatest successes."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":507,"title":"Best Weather Satellite Ever Built Rockets Into Space","class":1,"body":"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The most advanced weather satellite ever built rocketed into space Saturday night, part of an $11 billion effort to revolutionize forecasting and save lives. This new GOES-R spacecraft will track U.S. weather as never before: hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, volcanic ash clouds, wildfires, lightning storms, even solar flares. Indeed, about 50 TV meteorologists from around the country converged on the launch site — including NBC’s Al Roker — along with 8,000 space program workers and guests.  What’s so exciting is that we’re going to be getting more data, more often, much more detailed, higher resolution, Roker said. In the case of tornadoes, if we can give people another 10, 15, 20 minutes, we’re talking about lives being saved. Think superhero speed and accuracy for forecasting. Super high-definition TV, versus black-and-white. Really a quantum leap above any satellite NOAA has ever flown, said Stephen Volz, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s director of satellites. For the American public, that will mean faster, more accurate weather forecasts and warnings, Volz said earlier in the week. That also will mean more lives saved and better environmental intelligence for government officials responsible for hurricane and other evacuations. Airline passengers also stand to benefit, as do rocket launch teams. Improved forecasting will help pilots avoid bad weather and help rocket scientists know when to call off a launch. NASA declared success 3 1/2 hours after liftoff, following separation from the upper stage. The first in a series of four high-tech satellites, GOES-R hitched a ride on an unmanned Atlas V rocket, delayed an hour by rocket and other problems. NOAA teamed up with NASA for the mission. The satellite — valued by NOAA at $1 billion — is aiming for a 22,300-mile-high equatorial orbit. There, it will join three aging spacecraft with 40-year-old technology, and become known as GOES-16. After months of testing, this newest satellite will take over for one of the older ones. The second satellite in the series will follow in 2018. All told, the series should stretch to 2036. GOES stands for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. The first was launched in 1975. GOES-R’s premier imager — one of six science instruments — will offer three times as many channels as the existing system, four times the resolution and five times the scan speed, said NOAA program director Greg Mandt. A similar imager is also flying on a Japanese weather satellite. Typically, it will churn out full images of the Western Hemisphere every 15 minutes and the continental United States every five minutes. Specific storm regions will be updated every 30 seconds. Forecasters will get pictures like they’ve never seen before, Mandt promised. A first-of-its-kind lightning mapper, meanwhile, will take 500 snapshots a second. This next-generation GOES program — $11 billion in all — includes four satellites, an extensive land system of satellite dishes and other equipment, and new methods for crunching the massive, nonstop stream of expected data. Hurricane Matthew, interestingly enough, delayed the launch by a couple weeks. As the hurricane bore down on Florida in early October, launch preps were put on hold. Matthew stayed far enough offshore to cause minimal damage to Cape Canaveral, despite some early forecasts that suggested a direct strike."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":508,"title":"Why Does The Earth Pull On One Side Of The Moon More? Is The Moon Lopsided?","class":1,"body":"Why does the Earth pull on one side of the Moon more than the other side? Is it because the mass of the Moon is not even, and one side has more mass than the other? The Moon is pretty round; it’s set up much like the Earth – with a core of iron, surrounded by a mantle of other rocks, and topped off with a crust between 21 and 27 miles thick, at the surface. As far as we can tell, each of those components is pretty perfectly centered within the sphere that makes up our Moon. Could we tell if the mass of the moon were offset somehow? Let’s say the near side of the Moon were made of denser rock (more mass per unit area)  than the far side for some reason. What measurements would that change? It wouldn’t necessarily change the elevation mapping; after all, you can just as easily have a large pile of dense rocks as you can have a large pile of less dense rock. However, what would change is the gravitational field mapping. In order to better understand exactly this sort of question – are the rocks over here roughly the same density as the rocks over there – we have mapped out very detailed measurements of the gravitational pull surrounding a number of other worlds  – not to mention our own. The final result looks like the image below (when unfurled from the sphere of the Moon), when viewed through the eyes of the twin Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) satellites. These two satellites, dubbed Ebb and Flow, orbited the moon for nine months in 2012."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":509,"title":"NASA News: Is The Moon Lopsided?","class":1,"body":"It is interesting to notice that the moon's gravitational pull seems higher on one side than the other. NASA explains this mysterious phenomenon through its Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL). Looking at what appears to be a lopsided celestial body composed of iron core, mantle of rocks and approximately a 21 to 27-mile crust, people are hypothesizing that the rocks are denser on the nearer side than the other, according to Forbes. In 2012, NASA conducted a gravitational field mapping using two satellites named Ebb and Flow to measure the lunar gravity with high spatial resolution and supreme accuracy. In NASA's published image, the red area shows mass excesses, while the blue area displays mass deficiencies. According to the map, the near side has a more detailed scale than the far side due to the far side's higher number of small craters. We used gradients of the gravity field in order to highlight smaller and narrower structures than could be seen in previous datasets, said GRAIL guest scientist Jeff Andrews-Hanna from Colorado School of Mines in Golden. This data revealed a population of long, linear gravity anomalies, with lengths of hundreds of kilometers, crisscrossing the surface. These linear gravity anomalies indicate the presence of dikes, or long, thin, vertical bodies of solidified magma in the subsurface. The dikes are among the oldest features on the moon, and understanding them will tell us about its early history. Meanwhile, NASA concludes that it is misleading when people call the far side of the Moon as the dark side just because we could only see one side of it as it orbits the Earth. The Sun's changing illumination explains why the moon go through its phases and then it is completely illuminated during full moon."}

Punkin Chunkin is a competitive event organized by the World Championship Punkin Chunkin Association in which teams compete to hurl pumpkins long distances with the use of elaborate homemade mechanical launchers. This year was to mark the event’s return to TV with a new competition after a two-year hiatus. Science Channel planned an elaborate special that would have been simulcast on its sibling Discovery Channel. In light of the unfortunate incident at the Punkin Chunkin event on Nov. 6, Science Channel will not air ‘Punkin Chunkin’ as originally planned, Science Channel spokesman Paul Schur said. We are sending our hopes and prayers for a full recovery to the injured woman, her family and loved ones. The woman’s name has not been released. A report Nov. 10 in Delaware’s Cape Gazette described the victim as a 39-year-old producer working on the event. The special was to have been produced by Sharp Entertainment with Matt Sharp, Dan Adler and Scott Miller exec producing, along with Kyle McCabe exec producing for Science Channel and Lindsey Foster Blumberg serving as producer for Science Channel. According to local reports, the woman was injured when the air cannon operated by the Punkin Reaper team malfunctioned, sending a large metal plate flying. The woman was hit in the head and in the face. The victim’s medical status was not immediately clear on Sunday. The competition was held Nov. 4-6 in Bridgeville, Del. The Punkin Chunkin competitive event began in 1986. A TV special derived from the Delaware gathering of backyard enthusiasts first aired on Discovery in 2002. Six years later, Science Channel picked up the property and made it an annual post-Thanksgiving tradition. However, the event was not held in 2014 and 2015, forcing Science Channel to run clip shows of past Punkin Chunkin competitions. I couldn’t be prouder to announce that, thanks to the unparalleled efforts of our dedicated volunteers and the undying support of the community we serve, the Chunk is back, and we intend for it to be bigger and better than ever, said Punkin Chunkin president Frank Peyton in announcing the special last month. We’re honored to once again be partnering with Science Channel to help further the Chunk’s reach and promote the charitable endeavors and scholarship programs that it always has, and always will, support.

As part of the program, 47 of the world's poorest nations discussed the idea of using exclusively renewable energy. Among the countries, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Haiti issued statements concerning this environmental direction. The countries decided to update their national plans until 2020, through systematic carbon cuts that will be monitored nationwide. Agreement For Renewable Energy There were two weeks of negotiations behind these decisions, and one of the most powerful incentives that managed to convince the states' representatives was the idea of showing commitment toward the issue of global warming. The members of the CVF promised, as part of this project, to transit to entirely green economies between 2030 and 2050. According to the document that resulted from the meeting, the underlying causes of disaster risk and climate vulnerability must be addressed as soon and as efficiently a possible, in a global scale. The countries' representatives also promised to address the already signed climate-binding contract. The Paris Agreement was reached after the Paris Conference on climate change, which took place December 2015, where a number of 195 countries signed the first-ever binding global climate deal. As a result of this latest meeting, the representatives of all 47 countries promised to achieve carbon neutrality by the 2050s, as stipulated in the aforementioned Paris Agreement. The governments of the 195 signers have agreed to meet every five years, in an attempt to monitor the evolution of the agreement's stipulations. Steps For Reducing Global Warming U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon notes that every country should fully comprehend the impact of climate change on the global future, and take all the necessary measures that will guarantee the security, economic prosperity and well-being of their countries' citizens. The Secretary-General also supports the idea of global cooperation when it comes to facing a threat that could potentially harm all countries, regardless of economic status or stability. The engagement of the least economically stable countries means true cooperation in fighting this alarming situation. Additionally, the 47 states unanimously agreed to commit to creating an international cooperative system that will bring consistent changes, which will serve the purpose of being fully equipped when it comes to facing climate change. The idea to transit toward 100 percent renewable energy as rapidly as possible is part of this higher commitment that binds countries together worldwide to fight climate change."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":512,"title":"Stephen Hawking: Humans won't live another 1,000 years on Earth","class":1,"body":"The world’s most celebrated physicist and cosmologist issued a call for humans to continue to go into space for the future of humanity. I don’t think we will survive another 1,000 years without escaping beyond our fragile planet, Stephen Hawking said while delivering a lecture on the universe and the origins of humans at the Oxford Union debating society on Monday, according to the British newspaper The Independent. Despite the dire warning, Hawking also tried to sound a hopeful note about the future of human achievement.  Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet, Hawking said, according to The Independent. Try to make sense of what you see, wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. In recent months, Hawking has used his stature in the sciences to make broad statements about the thorny moral and political dilemmas facing modern societies. In an essay published in The Guardian in July, Hawking argued that in order for humans to survive the massive, serious challenges ahead — climate change, overtaxed food production, and overpopulation, to name a few — they need to resist the individualism and isolationism that have fueled political movements like Brexit. We will need to adapt, rethink, refocus and change some of our fundamental assumptions about what we mean by wealth, by possessions, by mine and yours. Just like children, we will have to learn to share, he wrote. If we fail then the forces that contributed to Brexit, the envy and isolationism not just in the UK but around the world that spring from not sharing, of cultures driven by a narrow definition of wealth and a failure to divide it more fairly, both within nations and across national borders, will strengthen. If that were to happen, I would not be optimistic about the long-term outlook for our species."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":513,"title":"Is EmDrive Real? NASA Paper On ‘Impossible’ Propulsion System Passes Peer Review","class":1,"body":"Can you drive a car by getting on the front seat and pushing the windshield? The answer, as anyone familiar with high-school level physics would tell you, is no. Newton’s third law of motion — for every action has an equal and opposite reaction — explicitly prohibits this. However, after months of rumors, speculation and criticism, a peer-reviewed study published last week in the Journal of Propulsion and Power claims to have shown a propulsion system that, to all appearances violates this cardinal law, actually seems to work. Electromagnetic drive, or EmDrive, is a proposed fuel-free propulsion system that putatively works by bouncing microwaves around a closed chamber. The problem with this kind of propulsion system is that it’s impossible. A system cannot produce thrust without pushing something in the opposite direction. Despite this, speculation that NASA was on the verge of developing an EmDrive, has been floating around for over a year now — even though physicists repeatedly dismissed it as impossible. The new study, though, shows otherwise. It details experiments carried out by NASA’s Eagleworks Laboratories and describes a radio frequency resonant cavity thruster — EmDrive by another name — that is capable of producing thrust of up to 1.2 millinewtons per kilowatt in vacuum. The researchers achieved this by turning electricity into microwaves and bouncing them around in a closed copper cone. Although an order of magnitude higher thrust can be produced using rocket fuel, the significance of the paper lies in the fact that it shows the existence of something that current laws of physics tell us shouldn’t exist. The issue involved here is whether the experiment is seeing something real or not, Jim Woodward, a physicist at California State University, Fullerton, told Motherboard. I know [study co-author] Paul [March] does clean work and to be honest, I suspect there may really be something there. But the result they're seeing can't actually be explained in terms of the theory they're proposing. So the question is: what is causing it? Although the exact cause is yet to be determined, the study does offer an explanation — one that invokes a controversial interpretation of quantum mechanics known as the pilot-wave theory, which,  unlike the currently-accepted Copenhagen interpretation, states that subatomic particles do have fixed locations even when they are not being observed. According to the researchers, if the pilot-wave interpretation is true, it would allow the EmDrive to generate thrust by acting on virtual particle pairs created by fluctuations in quantum vacuum. It is proposed that the tapered RF test article pushes off of quantum vacuum fluctuations, and the thruster generates a volumetric body force and moves in one direction while a wake is established in the quantum vacuum that moves in the other direction, the researchers wrote in the study. However, this is still a hypothesis that needs to be stringently tested before its passes muster. Moreover, it should be noted that just because a study has passed peer-review, it doesn’t mean its results are valid, only that the researchers’ methodology was considered sound. But this milestone shouldn’t be downplayed either, astrophysicist Brian Koberlein wrote for Forbes. With this new paper we now have a clear overview of the experimental setup and its results. This is a big step toward determining whether the effect is real or an odd set of secondary effects."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":514,"title":"NASA's Physics-Defying EM Drive Passes Peer Review","class":1,"body":"The reactionless thruster known as the EM Drive has stirred heated debate over the past few years. If successful it could provide a new and powerful method to take our spacecraft to the stars, but it has faced harsh criticism because the drive seems to violate the most fundamental laws of physics. One of the biggest criticisms has been that the work wasn’t submitted for peer review, and until that happens it shouldn’t be taken seriously. Well, this week that milestone was reached with a peer-reviewed paper. The EM Drive has officially passed peer review. It’s important to note that passing peer review means that experts have found the methodology of the experiments reasonable. It doesn’t guarantee that the results are valid, as we’ve seen with other peer-reviewed research such as BICEP2. But this milestone shouldn’t be downplayed either. With this new paper we now have a clear overview of the experimental setup and its results. This is a big step toward determining whether the effect is real or an odd set of secondary effects. That said, what does the research actually say? The basic idea of the EMDrive is an asymmetrical cavity where microwaves are bounced around inside. Since the microwaves are trapped inside the cavity, there is no propellent or emitted electromagnetic radiation to push the device in a particular direction, standard physics says there should be no thrust on the device. And yet, for reasons even the researchers can’t explain, the EM Drive does appear to experience thrust when activated. The main criticism has focused on the fact that this device heats up when operated, and this could warm the surrounding air, producing a small thrust. In this new work the device was tested in a near vacuum, eliminating a major criticism. What the researchers found was that the device appears to produce a thrust of 1.2 ± 0.1 millinewtons per kilowatt of power in a vacuum, which is similar to the thrust seen in air. By comparison, ion drives can provide a much larger 60 millinewtons per kilowatt. But ion drives require fuel, which adds mass and limits range. A functioning EM drive would only require electric power, which could be generated by solar panels. An optimized engine would also likely be even more efficient, which could bring it into the thrust range of an ion drive. While all of this is interesting and exciting, there are still reasons to be skeptical. As the authors point out, even this latest vacuum test doesn’t eliminate all the sources of error. Things such as thermal expansion of the device could account for the results, for example. Now that the paper is officially out, other possible error sources are likely to be raised. There’s also the fact that there’s no clear indication of how such a drive can work. While the lack of theoretical explanation isn’t a deal breaker (if it works, it works), it remains a big puzzle to be solved.  The fact remains that experiments that seem to violate fundamental physics are almost always wrong in the end. I’ve been pretty critical of this experiment from the get go, and I remain highly skeptical. However, even as a skeptic I have to admit the work is valid research. This is how science is done if you want to get it right. Do experiments, submit them to peer review, get feedback, and reevaluate. For their next trick the researchers would like to try the experiment in space. I admit that’s an experiment I’d like to see."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":515,"title":"Wandering whale spotted in Hudson River for third time in less than a week","class":1,"body":"This whale is making a splash! Eagle-eyed water watchers spotted a whale in the Hudson River off the Holland Tunnel Sunday, marking the third time in less than a week the bunker-hungry mammal has surfaced in the city’s waterways. The Coast Guard warned maritime vessels to watch out for the whale, at about noon, and one witness said it stopped breaching the waters near Pier 88 by about 4:45 p.m. It was breaching every two or three minutes for about an hour this afternoon. It was surreal, said Michael Moss, 36, who started watching the whale after his wife, Katherine Rikkola, spotted its tail at about 3:30 p.m., from their home in Weehawken, N.J.  We have binoculars, so we looked over by Pier 88, Pier 90, and it was right outside the pier there. Paul Sieswerda of Gotham Whale couldn’t confirm if it was the same humpback whale seen by the Statue of Liberty on Wednesday, or near the George Washington Bridge Friday afternoon.  That’s where it comes into the science part of it. Without good documentation we can’t say for sure, but certainly it would be the logical assumption to make. But where it went all day yesterday we don’t know, he said. Sieswerda says he has a fluke shot photo from an earlier sighting -- essentially a photo of the tail that could serve as a fingerprint of sorts -- that he can check against any new pictures and videos his organization gets. And the whale may be a repeat New York City tourist -- one witness made a similar sighting in the Hudson from her window off W. 63rd St. last November. Rachel Dubroff, 39, said she didn’t grab a camera when she spotted the whale last year, but this time, she was ready. She took video Saturday, and watched again on Sunday afternoon It looked like a humpback whale, she said. I’ve seen them in Hawaii and the Caribbean and Australia. You don’t usually expect to see outside your window in the Hudson river. Dubroff said she was worried about the second sighting, because of the Hudson River’s boat traffic. Sieswerda said he’s optimistic that the whale knows how to avoid nearby vessels. If I was its parent, I would be saying get out of the street, but so far so good, he said. Gotham Whale has catalogued more than 100 whale sightings in the New York City area this year. The whales are usually seen along the New Jersey shoreline and Rockaway Beach."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":516,"title":"What’s a deep-sea sub doing in the middle of Kansas?","class":1,"body":"SALINA, KAN. Chickens peck in the dirt at the end of the rutted drive. Out back of the house, a rooster crows. And in a building that looks like a fine place to park a combine, a crew works on a submarine that can go 8,000 feet deep in the ocean. Only a half-dozen or so subs in the world can do that. The others are owned by governments and research groups in Russia, France, Japan and the U.S. Then there’s Scott Waters, 29, the head of his family’s chain of hardware stores. He found his submarine in storage in Wisconsin, loaded it on a flatbed truck and hauled it home to Salina. Its name is Pisces VI and it can go where light can’t, down to an undersea world of legend and fantasy, the part of the planet we know least about. And Waters is here on a gravel road in Kansas wheat country. Some people know him as the crazy submarine guy. Fascinated by the deep sea since boyhood, he got hold of a blueprint and built a two-man submarine from scratch. Took him five years. It can go 350 feet deep. He named it Trustworthy and not long ago put it in Milford Lake, near Fort Riley. Worked just like it was supposed to. But he didn’t see much down there. Some old tires, mud, tree branches and a few catfish, Waters said, a boyish smile under the brim of his ball cap. Hardly Jules Verne stuff. Waters needed more. So he looked the world over and found Pisces VI. Back in its 1970s Cold War heyday, the spherical submersible was used for research and oil exploration in the North Sea. Its owner, International Underwater Contractors, wanted $500,000. After nine months, Waters, apparently quite the negotiator, got the price down to $30,000. That was in December. Now, instead of the bottom of Milford Lake, he hopes to someday see undiscovered species, lava flows from underwater volcanoes, bright-colored sponges the size of washing machines and who knows what else. The plan is to take Pisces VI apart and put it back together using new digital technology to come up with an ultra-modern submersible for scientific research and the film industry. His business plan calls for an investment of $250,000, which he thinks he can make back in two years. Because a lot of funding has been cut for exploration programs, Waters thinks he can offer Pisces as a cheaper option for scientists and film crews. He’s a smart guy. Smart enough to know he can’t do this one alone like he did Trustworthy. So he put together a team of 10, including engineers, scientists and master machinists. One did electrical engineering for NASA. One is from England, and the rest hail from all over the U.S. Two or three times a year, Waters gathers them at his place north of Salina for a week or two. The retrofit is well underway. Waters thinks he can have the Pisces ready to launch two years from now. It will first be tested at the University of Pennsylvania, which has a tank that can simulate pressure. The challenge to the whole thing is that the sub was built in 1976 and has been sitting in storage for 25 years with old saltwater having its way with vital parts. Safety, contingency and craftsmanship are fairly important. Because at 8,000 feet, ain’t nobody coming to get you, project crew chief Vance Bradley said when the team got together recently. Pisces will have room for a pilot and three passengers. It will be powered by two 7-horsepower thrusters that can propel it at three knots. The team works during the day. At night, as stars shine bright over Kansas farmland, they sit in the big outbuilding Waters had made specifically for Pisces. They drink Corona and Labatt Blue, smoke cigars and swap stories about a shared love — the mystery of the deep sea. Bradley, who lives in Florida, actually worked on Pisces VI back in the day. This thing will put footprints on the ocean floor and a hundred years from now they’ll still be there, Bradley said. How cool is that? Grace C. Young is the project’s science ambassador. She will be the link to research groups and networks such as Discovery Channel and National Geographic. Young graduated from high school early, earned an engineering degree at MIT and now is doing thesis work on oceanic imagery at the University of Oxford in England. Question: What made her come to be part of this? People asked me that when I left Oxford — ‘Kansas? Really?’ It’s because we all believe in what Scott’s doing. I’m very interested in climate change, and the oceans are a big part of that. This is very important: This submarine and what he wants to do can change the world. Then there’s the Salina guy, master machinist Ryan Brax Johnson, who went to high school with Waters. Early on, he was one of several locals who helped take the sub apart. The others left when that job was over. Johnson kept coming back. With a background in robotics, he can invent a tool on the spot and then make it. He can’t match the others in academics or tales of the sea, but he makes up for that with zeal and pride to be part of something like this. I’m the walk-on, the greenhorn, he said. But I’ve scraped my knuckles plenty. I’ve earned my ride on this thing. ‘Scott’s dream’ Waters studied at Kansas State University but dropped out because he knew he was destined to take over the family business. I figured what better training could I get than to work here and learn how to do things, he said. He started an event planning line that today is a key part of the hardware chain’s business. He likes his job. He’s respectful of the duty. But friends will say his mind reaches far beyond the nuts and bolts of a corporate world. Then he announced he was building a submarine. Sure, people thought I was probably crazy, he said of Trustworthy. It took me awhile, but I got it done. His dad, Jim Waters, laughs when he tells about the state inspector who showed up at Milford Lake to sign off on the homemade sub the day it went into the water. The guy from the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks & Tourism hadn’t come across many submarines so had Scott explain how he built it and what everything was. The man approved it. According to Jim, the guy wrapped up with: You know, there’s never been a submarine on this lake before. He takes pride in that story. Don’t believe all that stuff you hear about millennials, he said. Look at his son. Look at Grace Young, who is 23. They want to do great things, Jim said. He was the fifth generation to head Waters Hardware before naming Scott to head the company of seven stores and 250 employees. Do I wish he spent more time running the business instead of working on his submarine? Sure, said Jim, who remains as chief financial officer. Retail is tough. But he’s good at it and my goal in life is to have my three children do something in life they feel really good about. The Pisces VI, that’s Scott’s dream. And when you look at history, most of the people who’ve done great things were dreamers. Scott comes off as ambitious and exceedingly curious — a young man pulled by the hope of an adventurous future while grounded by family legacy. Many things in his life seem dichotomous. Feet on the plains, but dreams of the sea. He studies schematics on digital technology while chickens roost out his back door. And in his garage, on the other side of the wall from Pisces VI, sits a Ford Model A pickup his great-great-grandfather — son of the hardware chain’s founder — used in the 1920s to deliver goods from the first store. The old truck is a constant reminder of how Scott got to where he is, and ballast for where he wants to go. If you met Scott in a bar or at McDonald’s, you’d never know he ran a multimillion-dollar business, said longtime friend Joel Ernst. He’ll wrench on this sub until 10 at night then be back in the office at 6 the next morning. Waters also climbs mountains, scuba dives and pilots a plane. If he could get a seat to go to Mars, he’d do it, Ernst said. And once he makes up his mind to do something, there’s no stopping him. Johnson nodded. I figure that’s why he got the thing for $30,000 — they knew he’d get it back in the water. ‘Won’t be easy’ John Smith, science director for the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory, or HURL, was surprised to learn that Pisces VI was in Kansas. HURL, which formed in 1980 as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, owns Pisces IV and V. Earlier this month, the subs were northwest of Hawaii near the international date line as part of a Florida State University research project on deep sea coral recovery. HURL once tried to acquire Pisces VI. The VI is actually the deepest-rated one and that’s why we were interested in it, said Smith, who has been 16,000 feet deep in another kind of research sub. We didn’t know this guy had it. It’s a classic sub, but what he wants to do won’t be easy. When Waters gets the sub ocean-ready, it will have to be approved by the American Bureau of Shipping, the world’s leading ship classification society. It sets standards for maritime safety and operations. I doubt there’s an inspector in Kansas, Smith said. Pisces in pieces Late morning, a farmer’s pickup stirred the dust on the gravel road in front of Waters’ house. Out back, the Pisces team was trying to figure a way to disassemble the latch on the sub’s hatch. The building measures 38 feet by 85 feet and has an 18-foot ceiling. The concrete floor is seven inches thick. A gantry lift helps support the 15,000-pound submarine. Big parts of Pisces sit around. Old wooden crates hold smaller parts. We have Pisces all over the place in here, Bradley said. A big part of job has been to dig through it all to see what can be reused. Many parts, though, will be replaced regardless with lighter ones, allowing the new Pisces to shed a thousand pounds. We’re going to lighten the load and have more room for crew and be able to stay down longer, said Mike Patterson, the former NASA engineer who was brought on to work on electronics and propulsion systems. He and Bradley were lifting parts from a heap and calling them out: oxygen monitor, electrical accessory panel, oxygen inlet flow component, starboard motor controller and so on. Young climbed out of a crate with an electrical connector in decent shape. She smiled. This is like finding gold, she said. She and the others turn loose their regular lives to make these regular trips to Kansas, and they stay at Waters’ place. It all makes perfect sense to them. This is a rare and a one-of-a-kind thing, Patterson said, smiling. The team also includes a welding specialist, a safety director and a documentarian. For Waters, a prairie boy inspired by Disney’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, it’s about where Pisces VI is headed, not where they are getting her ready. Besides, he said, I’m about equal distance from the Atlantic and Pacific. The team works hard, bangs knuckles and gets dirty. They came together as strangers, but now gather like family. And after supper, as they talk deep into the night, the same stars that guided ships of old shine bright above the wheat fields."}

NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy from the Russian federal space agency Roscosmos, and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully arrived at the ISS on Nov. 19 at 4:58 p.m. (9:58 GMT), docking the Soyuz spacecraft to the station's Rassvet module. Capture confirmed, a NASA commentator announced during a live broadcast aired on the agency's television and website. The new crewmembers arrived two days after they launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Thursday, Nov. 17. They will be joining the Expedition 50 crew, which is composed of NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrei Borisenko, who arrived at the orbiting lab in October. Together, the six crew members will contribute to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science, NASA said. One of the experiments to be conducted would be recording how lighting could impact the overall health and well-being of ISS crew and how the microgravity environment could affect tissue regeneration in humans and the genetic properties of plants grown in space, Space.com reports. During the mission, 56-year-old Whiston will be breaking a number of records. She is currently the oldest female astronaut to reach the space station. At the start of Expedition 51 in February, Whitson will also become the first woman to lead the ISS twice throughout its 16 years in orbit. In 2007, she served as commander of Expedition 16 and had been the first woman to hold the post. Whitson's journey to the ISS and back to Earth will also extend her existing record as the first woman to have the longest time in space. With the additional 179 days for Expedition 50/51, she will also hold the record for the most time in space by an American, surpassing current holder Jeff Williams of NASA. Apart from science experiments, the crew members will also receive three cargo deliveries consisting of food, fuel and supplies. The crew will also receive new lithium batteries as replacement for the nickel-hydrogen batteries currently used in storing energy generated by the station's solar arrays."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":518,"title":"China completes longest manned space mission yet","class":1,"body":"Two astronauts who completed China's longest-ever manned space mission returned to Earth safely Friday afternoon. Zhang Youxia, commander-in-chief of China's manned space program, announced that the Tiangong-2 and Shenzhou-11 manned flight mission, which lasted over a month, was a complete success. Zhang Gaoli, vice premier and a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory message from the CPC Central Committee, the State Council and the Central Military Commission at the command center of China's manned space program in Beijing. The completion of the Tiangong-2 and Shenzhou-11 mission marked a major breakthrough in China's manned space program, according to the congratulatory message. It said that under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, people of China's aerospace industry have implemented the innovation-driven development and civil-military integration strategies. Their efforts to forge ahead and overcome challenges, as well as their collaboration and sacrifice, demonstrate confidence in the path, theory, system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, it said. Shenzhou-11's reentry module separated from the spacecraft's orbiting capsule at 1:11 p.m. Friday Beijing Time, and then separated from the propelling capsule, ending the 33-day mission and embarking on the journey back to Earth. The reentry module landed safely at the expected site in central Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region at about 1:59 p.m. The ground search team reached the landing site immediately, and astronauts Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong opened the capsule's hatch by themselves. The two astronauts were reported by the ground team to be in good condition. The two astronauts arrived in Beijing Friday evening and will be quarantined and undergo medical check-ups. The mission of Shenzhou-11 marked China's sixth manned space flight. After its launch on Oct. 17, the spacecraft docked two days later with China's first space lab, Tiangong-2, where the two astronauts lived for 30 days. The mission transported personnel and materials between Earth and Tiangong-2, and tested meeting, docking and return processes. It conducted aerospace medical experiments, space science experiments and in-orbit maintenance. The two astronauts also conducted three experiments designed by middle school students from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including raising silkworms in space. It was the third space mission for 50-year-old veteran Jing Haipeng, the commander of the crew, who also participated in the Shenzhou-7 and Shenzhou-9 missions. It was the first space mission for Chen Dong, 38. The mission is a key step toward China's aim of building a permanent manned space station. The core module of China's space station is expected to be launched around 2018, and the space station will enter into full service around 2022, with an initial designed life of more than 10 years. It will accommodate three to six astronauts, who will stay in space up to one year. Tiangong-2 will remain operative in orbit following Shenzhou-11's return to Earth and will wait to dock with Tianzhou-1, China's first cargo spacecraft. Tianzhou-1 will be launched in the first half of 2017 to verify refueling technology, a key technology for any space station. The success of this mission demonstrates that China has acquired the capability to support long stays in space by astronauts, Huang Weifen, a deputy chief designer with the Astronaut Center of China, announced at a press conference Friday afternoon. Some new key technologies to support long-term manned space missions were tested in orbit, Huang said. For instance, a running exercise device - crucial for long-term space lab missions - was tested and will help guide future research and development. Remote medical consultation system linking the space lab and space center on earth, medical ultrasound, and plant cultivation were also tested during the mission. Growing plants has proven to be a good and effective means for psychological adjustment, she added. Moreover, the excellent performance by the astronauts verified the efficacy of China's astronaut recruitment and training systems, said Huang. Testing of the technology is crucial to supporting the health, life and work of astronauts in future space missions, and will help with the future design of space lab interfaces, astronaut tasks and in-orbit operations, she said. Source: Xinhua News Agency BOX IT China to select new astronauts in 2017 BEIJING, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) - China will start a third round of astronaut selection in 2017, an official from the Astronaut Center of China said Friday. Huang Weifen, deputy chief designer of the astronaut system with the center, made the announcement at a press conference after the Tiangong-2 and Shenzhou-11 mission came to completion on Friday afternoon. In preparation for the manned space station program, the new selection process will pick candidates from air force pilots, space engineers and technical staff in aerospace-related fields."}

Veteran mission commander Jing Haipeng and first-time space traveler Chen Dong were reported in good health after their Shenzhou 11 return vehicle landed on the frozen steppes of Inner Mongolia. They spent 30 days aboard the Tiangong 2 station conducting experiments and testing equipment in preparation for the launching of the station's core module in 2018. A fully functioning, permanently crewed space station is on course to begin operations six years from now and is slated to run for at least a decade. The success of the mission indicates that our manned space program has achieved major new progress and is the latest achievement in building a country of innovation and a world power of science and technology, the ruling Communist Party's Central Committee, the Cabinet and the party commission controlling the military said in a congratulatory message. It is the newest achievement of Chinese people in climbing the peak of the world, said the letter, read out by Vice Premier Zhao Gaoli at the space flight control center in Beijing. Since first launching a human into space 13 years ago, China has launched two space stations, staged a spacewalk, landed a rover on the moon and is now considering sending a crewed lunar mission. The Tiangong, or Heavenly Palace, space stations are considered stepping stones to a mission to send a rover to Mars by the end of the decade. Communications with the disused experimental Tiangong 1 station have been cut and it is expected to burn up on entering the atmosphere next year. China was excluded from the International Space Station mainly due to U.S. legislation barring such cooperation and concerns over the Chinese space program's strongly military character. Chinese officials are now looking to internationalize their own program by offering to help finance other countries' missions to Tiangong 2, which, at 60 tons when completed, would still be considerably smaller than the 420-ton ISS. The space station was launched on Sept. 15 and is orbiting 393 kilometers (244 miles) above Earth. In a recent editorial, state newspaper China Daily congratulated the country on having never given up on its resolve to catch up with the world's leaders in science and technology, as its leadership understands the importance of science and technology for a nation's development. That explains why China has achieved such a lot in the development of its space technology in the past two decades and is striving to make new breakthroughs, the paper said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":520,"title":"New Discovery: Roundest Star In The Universe Found","class":1,"body":"A study conducted by a team of researchers lead by Laurent Gizon from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and the University of Göttingen revealed that a distant star Kepler 11145123 is the roundest object in the universe. Tech Times reported that star's roundness is usually measured by a technique called asteroseismology --- the study of the oscillations of stars --- where the difference between the star's equatorial and polar radii is calculated. On an average, a star's equatorial bulge is 1.5 million kilometers. Kepler 11145123 has an equatorial bulge of 3 kilometers, making it rounder than most. This makes Kepler 11145123 the roundest natural object ever measured, even more round than the Sun explains Gizon in a press release. Kepler 11145123 is located about 5,000 light-years away from planet Earth. It is more than twice the size of the sun and rotates three times more slowly than the Sun. According to Space.com,  round celestial bodies become flat and bulge slightly at their equators due to centrifugal force.The faster they spin, the greater the force, and the larger the bulge. Gizon's team could measure the roundness of Kepler 11145123 because it has purely sinusoidal oscillations, meaning, the star's periodic expansions and contractions can be detected in its changing luminosity. The oscillation was measured by the Kepler Space Telescope over four years. New Atlas cites that the possible explanation to this perfect shape is that there could be a magnetic field at lower latitudes of the star that acts like a sort of cosmic corset to counteract the centrifugal forces. Meanwhile, the team said they intend to use the same method they used in Kepler 11145123 to study other stars with sinusoidal oscillations. We intend to apply this method to other stars observed by Kepler and the upcoming space missions TESS and PLATO. It will be particularly interesting to see how faster rotation and a stronger magnetic field can change a star's shape, Gizon adds, An important theoretical field in astrophysics has now become observational."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":521,"title":"Evidence Overwhelms Denial at Global Climate Forum","class":1,"body":"To no one’s surprise but everyone’s dismay, 2016 is proving to be the hottest year on record according to the World Meteorological Organization. Delivered at the UN Climate Conference in Marrakech, this announcement highlights why countries and companies and cities must act together, focusing on the science and solutions rather than the pitch and yaw of global politics. Changes in climate affect us all but particularly vulnerable populations such as agricultural smallholders - who also form the roots of many of our supply chains. For as much as the political pendulum swings, the issues being faced by UNFCCC delegates in Paris last year, Marrakech this year and in future meetings will not be solved during the tenure of any one political leader - or even any business leader. Instead the negotiations, programs and targets required to evade runaway climate change involve action and far-sightedness over decades. The Paris Agreement signed last year recognizes this and so do we. The challenges are the same for the global businesses that are widely represented here in Morocco. The world’s corporates must make their commitments to targets and strategies based on the long view. This explains why, during the fortnight long conference, Mars revealed plans for a new wind farm in Mexico, following on from similar previous wind projects in Texas and Scotland. And why we announced our next short-term target of a 40% GHG reduction from 2007 in our operations - building on our delivery of our 2015 target of a 25% reduction. These decisions help us to deliver on our own long-term goal of phasing out fossil fuels from our operations by 2040. And they are made irrespective of political agendas. Innovation and efficiency have been the watch-words of this 105-year-old company, and our announcements are consistent with that. We already recognize the clear business case for investing in renewable energy over fossil fuels. As pricing on carbon is inevitable, it follows that we can ensure a distinct competitive advantage by becoming a low-carbon business before that moment arrives. Evidence of the inevitability of a low-carbon economy is all around us. Across the UK, solar panels generated more electricity than coal in the past six months, while in a single night in April this year, the UK’s electricity demand was met without burning any coal. Across the world we are all on a path to a low-carbon economy and the only debate now is over the speed of change. As a multinational company, we have a responsibility to expedite change both in our peer group and within the wider business community. At Mars, we set our science-based target back in 2009 with an aim to get to zero carbon in our operations by 2040. But in order to deliver against the vision agreed in Paris, we need everyone to pull together. We can, and must, do more."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":522,"title":"Supermoon reminds us of the moon's wonders","class":1,"body":"As I strolled along with my dog on our evening walk, I admired the supermoon. It truly was spectacular as it rose above the horizon. As I walked, I was reminded of a song, Oh Mister Moon, that I used to sing with my dad when I was a little girl. I hadn’t thought of that song in years! I also remembered lying in the back yard with my parents staring up at the night sky. We would lie on our backs in the soft grass behind the garden and watch the stars and the moon. I could even smell the dewy grass as the memory played back in my mind. As the Earth’s only satellite, the moon continuously orbits around the planet. Together, they orbit the sun, and the pattern of day and night on the moon’s surface constantly changes. The amount of illumination on the face of the moon is called the moon’s phase. There are eight major phases: new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, last quarter and waning crescent. Waxing refers to the stages after the new moon and before the full moon, when the moon appears to be getting larger. Waning is the opposite, and refers to stages after the full moon and before the new moon, when the area that is illuminated is decreasing. The moon’s orbit around the Earth is slightly elliptical, making it appear closer or farther away at different times of the month. When the moon is full as it makes its pass closest to Earth, it can appear up to 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter and is termed a supermoon. The Nov. 14 supermoon was the brightest and largest moon since 1948. According to NASA, the next full moon to be this close to the planet will be 18 years from now. The moon is about one-fourth the size of Earth, making it a large satellite compared to other planets and their moons. This means the moon has a stronger effect on the planet. The moon’s gravity pulls at the Earth, causing the tides and slowing the Earth’s rotation. Every 100 years, the length of day increases by 2.3 milliseconds. The moon’s gravitational pull also stabilizes the Earth’s rotation so it doesn’t wobble as much. In the past, people used the moon to keep track of time by counting from one new moon to the next. This time period equals roughly one month and is called a lunar cycle. Native Americans assigned names to the full moon in each month. The November moon was called the Beaver Moon, and this was the time of year to set beaver traps to ensure a supply of warm furs for the upcoming winter. The November moon was also known as the Frost Moon because there often was frost by then. The moon has long fascinated people from all over the world. Perhaps we take it for granted because we spend so much time indoors, but events like the supermoon and the occasional eclipse encourage us to take another look at our astronomical next-door neighbor. Pay attention to its endless dance around our planet, and maybe you'll experience some of the wonder that has inspired people since the first of us gazed on its face."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":523,"title":"U.N. agency lifts Zika emergency, prepares for long-term fight","class":1,"body":"GENEVA — Acknowledging Zika is here to stay, the United Nations health agency on Friday lifted a 9-month-old emergency declaration and prepared for a longer-term response to the mosquito-borne virus that can result in severe neurological defects in newborns whose mothers were infected. World Health Organization officials were quick to note that the move does not mean the agency is downgrading the threat of the virus that has spread across Latin America, the Caribbean and elsewhere. Nearly 30 countries have reported birth defects linked to Zika, with 2,100 cases of nervous-system malformations reported in Brazil alone. The officials also emphasized that the now-lifted Public Health Emergency of International Concern was declared in February, when Zika clusters were appearing and a sharp increase in research was needed — and with the looming Rio Olympics in mind. The health agency said the emergency measures had led the world to an urgent and coordinated response, but the virus had continued to spread. It acknowledged that many aspects of this disease and associated consequences still remain to be understood, but this can best be done through sustained research. It is a significant and enduring public health challenge, but it no longer represents an emergency, Dr. David Heymann, who heads the health agency emergency committee on Zika, said after the panel met for the fifth time this year. There was no downgrading of this. Heymann said recommendations made in recent months were now being internalized at the Geneva-based agency. If anything, this has been escalated in importance by becoming activities that will be continued in the long-term in the World Health Organization, he said. Zika is mainly spread by mosquitoes, but also can be spread through sex. Most infected people don’t get sick. It can cause a mild illness, with fever, rash and joint pain. It also causes microcephaly, or shrunken heads, in newborn children whose mothers were infected, leading to severe developmental problems and sowing grave concerns of would-be parents in countries hit by the virus. Responding to the health agency announcement, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reiterated its position that pregnant women should avoid traveling to areas with local transmission of Zika. Dr. Peter Salama, the health agency’s director of emergencies, said the new phase of fighting the virus requires development donors to step up to the plate and see this for what it is, which is a long-term problem that the world will have to deal with for many years to come. We are sending the message that Zika is here to stay, and WHO’s response is here to stay in a very robust manner, Salama said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":524,"title":"WHO Zika Situation Report: Not An Emergency, Still A Threat; Health Experts Worry Zika Is Downgraded? [ VIDEO]","class":1,"body":"The World Health Organization (WHO) recently announced that Zika is no longer an international emergency, but warned that the virus is still a threat. Health officials worry that Zika may be downgraded and lose priority when it comes to monitoring and research. Various studies have established the link between Zika with microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome. In Brazil alone, 2,300 children have been affected and this number could be an underestimate due to children without manifestations of microcephaly, but still have serious neurological problems. Early this year in February, the WHO Zika situation report categorized the disease as an emergency, requiring all countries to report on confirmed cases and incidence of microcephaly. Last Friday, Dr. David Heymann, professor of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, addressed reporters in a conference call saying that Zika loses its label of international emergency, but not its importance as reported by ABC. Global health law expert, Lawrence Gostin of Georgetown University, echoed the fear of many observers, worrying that there will be a decline in research. Some people have already accused WHO of having a lethargic' response to Zika when there should be a race to develop vaccines. Heymann has admitted that the committee has initially worried that people may get the wrong message and insisted that Zika has just been raised as a prevailing and important disease. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control believes that it would be unfortunate if people believe that Zika is any less serious...because it's not as reported in Stat. WHO still warn pregnant women to avoid traveling to countries with reported Zika virus infection. Moreover, people who may have had exposure to the Zika virus refrain from engaging in unprotected sex for at least six months. Presently, the WHO Zika situation report still puts the virus as a serious threat as long as there are mosquitoes who carry it. Dr. Peter Salama, executive director of WHO's health Emergency Programme says that Zika is here to stay and WHO's response remains robust as it continues to find a cure as reported in Reuters."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":525,"title":"Two diabetes types are very different","class":1,"body":"Q. What are the differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes? A. Twenty-nine million Americans live with diabetes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Diabetes is an abnormality in the body's blood-sugar levels caused by the body's inability to produce enough insulin. As a result, the body will have high levels of sugar in the blood, as insulin is responsible for converting starches, sugar, and other food into the energy your body needs to properly function. Type 1 diabetes, which usually is initially diagnosed in patients younger than 40, indicates the pancreas is not producing enough insulin. It's considered an autoimmune disease, because the immune system mistakenly attacks parts of the body incorrectly and targets insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes, most often first diagnosed in patients 40 and older, occurs when the body isn't able to properly process the insulin it produces. This is known as insulin resistance. At first, the pancreas produces extra insulin, but over time, it won't be able to keep blood sugar at normal levels. Symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are similar and include thirst, extreme hunger, fatigue, frequent urination, weight loss, numbness or tingling in the extremities, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting and non-healing wounds. However, type 1 symptoms develop rapidly, where type 2 symptoms can start slowly. Treatment is significantly different for the two types of diabetes. Those with type 1 often need to inject themselves with insulin to make up for the loss of those cells. People living with type 2 diabetes can often achieve the target blood sugar level with diet and exercise alone. However, some may need to take medications or injections. There is no way to prevent or cure type 1 diabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising is the best prevention strategy against type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, the most important thing you can do is monitor blood sugar levels and stay in touch with your doctor if your condition changes. - Omeche Idoko, M.D., is a primary-care physician with Mercy Family Healthcare Services."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":526,"title":"Many Insured Children Lack Essential Health Care, Study Finds","class":1,"body":"Margo Solomon has health insurance for herself and her four children. But actually getting treatment is another matter. Ms. Solomon, a 35-year-old mother from the Bronx, says she has struggled to find a doctor who accepts her insurance. And with three of her children coping with asthma, and one with more complicated medical problems, locating a specialist is even more challenging. And once in the door, she cannot afford the costs, including for deductibles and medications. I feel like I am all alone out here, Ms. Solomon said. She is not alone. A new study to be released on Monday by the Children’s Health Fund, a nonprofit based in New York City that expands access to health care for disadvantaged children, found that one in four children in the United States did not have access to essential health care, though a record number of young people now have health insurance. The report found that 20.3 million people in the nation under the age of 18 lack access to care that meets modern pediatric standards. Guidelines issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics say that all children should get health maintenance visits for immunizations and other preventive services; management of acute and chronic medical conditions; access to mental health support and dental care; and have round-the-clock availability of emergency services and timely access to subspecialists. While Medicaid and many private insurance plans recommend or require that all of those services be provided, under the umbrella of what is known as the medical home, the study found that millions of insured children are not receiving many of the benefits. There are many children with insurance who cannot get primary care and those who can often have problems getting specialty care. As President-elect Donald J. Trump, a Republican, vows to repeal some, if not all, of the Affordable Care Act, which extended health care coverage to an additional 20 million people, the report’s authors worry that even more children could have trouble receiving the care they need. The fact that more than 20 million children in the U.S. experience insurance and noninsurance barriers to getting comprehensive and timely health care is a challenge that needs to get the highest-priority attention from the new administration, said the report’s lead author, Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the nonprofit Children’s Health Fund and a professor of pediatrics and health policy and management at Columbia University. Over the past two decades, the number of children without health insurance has steadily decreased to 3.3 million last year from around 10 million in 1997, according to an analysis of federal data and the federal government’s 2015 National Health Interview Survey. The effort to extend coverage began 50 years ago with the creation of Medicaid, which provides health insurance for the poor. It continued more recently with the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which offers low-cost coverage to those who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid and, under the Obama administration, with the Affordable Care Act, offering subsidized coverage and state exchanges. The study relied on census data and reports by federal agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prominent medical journals, as well as information extrapolated from the fund’s clinics and from its national network of programs that provide health care to underserved children across the country. The findings reveal a system in which getting quality care is often confusing and expensive, with even those who benefit from government programs often becoming deeply frustrated. For the insured, affordability is still an issue. The report noted that employer-based health insurance premiums for family coverage increased by 73 percent from 2003 to 2013. Employees’ contributions to the cost of the premiums climbed by 93 percent over that same period, though the rate of increase slowed after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The average deductible for an individual with health insurance was 5 percent of median income in 2013, up from 2 percent in 2003, the report said. The study also cited a survey that found that 59 percent of pediatricians said they had a hard time collecting patients’ shares of deductibles and co-payments from families covered by private high-deductible health plans. For those with Medicaid, like Ms. Solomon, difficulties in getting care have also grown. Many clinics and health systems do not accept patients with Medicaid, the study said, because of the low reimbursement rates. Ms. Solomon’s experience is typical. When I was pregnant with my last child, I had such a hard time finding prenatal care, she said. She called 15 to 20 doctors before finding one who took her insurance. I mean, we would call places and they would be like, ‘We take it,’ but it turned out they didn’t, she said. It was so hard. Even something as simple as getting medicine recently for her son’s strep throat was not simple. Because of a mix-up with her insurance card, Ms. Solomon had to cover a $20 co-payment for a prescription that should have been free, she said. The report said experiences like hers were common, both with government programs and some private insurers. The impacts of these barriers are significant, the report said. Parents faced with financial barriers might seek to save money by calling their doctor for advice, rather than seeing that doctor in person; rather than fill expensive prescriptions, a parent might rely on a limited supply of pharmaceutical samples. The medical debt incurred by such costs has been linked to reduced access to care, creating a vicious cycle. Perhaps just as significant are the barriers caused by demographics. Dr. Michael Kappy, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado just outside Denver, has seen the problem firsthand. Since 1996, he has traveled in Colorado, Montana and Wyoming to reach children in areas that do not have large medical centers or specialists. My focus has been strictly speaking to solving the geographic barrier, Dr. Kappy said. The study estimates that around 14 million children live in areas with a shortage of health professionals. More than three million low-income residents in New York live in federally designated shortage areas where, among other criteria, there is less than one primary care doctor for every 3,000 people. The Affordable Care Act sought to address that problem by expanding the National Health Service Corps, but 65 percent of rural areas still have shortages of health professionals. Dr. Kappy said one encouraging trend was the use of telemedicine, allowing for patients to be evaluated over the internet, with a local physician assistant aiding with hands-on work. To expand and improve tele-health options, however, the programs need to be properly reimbursed, he said, adding that programs that fund the work of doctors doing outreach to isolated communities were critical. Dr. Redlener, the study’s chief author, warned that repealing the Affordable Care Act without an adequate replacement could result in more than three million children losing their insurance. So far, Dr. Redlener said, none of the proposed replacements will do anything to mitigate what children would potentially lose if the A.C.A. is actually repealed."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":527,"title":"Florida Keys Approves Trial Of Genetically Modified Mosquitoes To Fight Zika","class":1,"body":"In the Florida Keys on Election Day, along with the presidential race, one of the most controversial items on the ballot dealt with Zika. In a nonbinding vote countywide, residents in the Florida Keys approved a measure allowing a British company to begin a trial release of genetically modified mosquitoes. Armed with that approval, local officials voted Saturday to try out what they hope will be a new tool in the fight against Zika. For months now, state and local authorities in Florida have struggled to control the spread of Zika. But although there have been more than 200 cases of locally transmitted Zika statewide, none have been reported in the Keys. And that's one reason why residents like Megan Hall oppose the new technology. At a meeting of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District board in Marathon on Saturday, Hall made a personal appeal to the board. I am going to ask you, beg you, plead with you, she said, not to go forward with this. For five years now, the district has been working with the British company Oxitec to get federal approval for a trial release of the mosquitoes in the Keys. The company releases genetically modified male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes into the wild. When they mate with female Aedes aegypti, their offspring die. In trials in Brazil, the Cayman Islands and other countries, Oxitec has shown its GM mosquitoes can reduce the population of Aedes Aegypti by 90 percent or more. But after five years, a small but vocal group of residents is not convinced the mosquitoes are safe. Opponent Dina Schoneck told the board, there are still too many unanswered questions about the new technology. She said, I believe there are a lot of risks that are not being considered. Although it doesn't have any cases of local Zika transmission yet, Monroe County, which includes the Keys, has had big problems in the past with dengue, another disease carried by the same mosquito. The head of the county's health department, Bob Eadie, supports the trials. Just because the county hasn't had any local Zika cases yet doesn't mean the disease isn't a threat, he said. Eadie went on, There is a tool available for the people of Monroe County that can help control mosquitoes that carry a very, very, very serious disease. In August, the Food and Drug Administration gave its approval for the trial, saying it found no potential adverse impact on human health or the environment. Because of the vocal opposition, the Mosquito Control District's Board of Commissioners decided to submit the trial to the voters in the form of two nonbinding resolutions. One was for the residents of Key Haven, the community where the trials were proposed. The other referendum went before voters in the rest of the county. Because Key Haven voters rejected it, commissioners say trials won't be conducted there. But in Saturday's meeting, the board approved trials elsewhere in the Keys at a location still to be determined. Jill Cranney-Gage is a commissioner who represents Key West. This is a tool mosquito control needs. When you're sworn into office, Cranney-Gage said,your main goal is to kill mosquitoes and to protect the residents and the county. Officials in the Keys say the announcement by the World Health Organization that Zika is no longer a public health emergency is in no way an indication the threat is lessening but that instead, it's a disease that's here to stay Florida Keys Mosquito Control District staff and Oxitec are now working now to identify a new neighborhood to conduct trials. Derric Nimmo with Oxitec is hopeful that identifying a new location and receiving federal approval will be a matter of a few months, and releases could start next year. Nimmo says he's encouraged that the GM mosquito technology gained the approval of a large majority — 58 percent of county residents. So there is very strong support for use of this technology in Monroe County, he says. And hopefully, they'll move forward with this trial. After months of struggling with Zika, health officials and mosquito control authorities elsewhere in Florida are eager to begin their own trials of the GM mosquitoes. Oxitec says if things go well in the Keys, it could begin trials next year in Miami."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":528,"title":"Alabama hunters cautioned to beware importing CWD-infected deer","class":1,"body":"Though Alabama is one of the best whitetail deer states in the nation, there's an undeniable appeal for many hunters to visiting other areas during the deer season, particularly those in the Midwest and in Canada where deer get a whole lot bigger and grow larger racks than those found anywhere in the South. But this year that can be a bit of a problem for any hunter who does not carefully follow the new regulations put in place by Alabama's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR) to protect our state deer herds from chronic wasting disease or CWD, the highly-contagious and fatal infection found in many states where whitetails are present these days. Larry Durham, 51, of Jackson County, was charged Nov 6 with violating the state's new CWD carcass ban for returning to Alabama with a deer harvested in Illinois, a known CWD state. In addition to violating Alabama's CWD ban, Durham violated Illinois law by harvesting the buck without the proper tag.  Charges from Illinois are forthcoming. The deer was sent to Auburn University for CWD testing and disposal. CWD is a fatal disease affecting the central nervous system of deer. Once introduced into the environment, it is impossible to eradicate, according to ADCNR. It was an anonymous tip from another Alabama resident traveling through Illinois that led to the charges against Durham. The caller, who knew about the CWD ban, stated they were behind a truck travelling south with Alabama plates that was loaded with hunting gear and a recently harvested buck, said Chris Champion, a Senior Conservation Enforcement Officer with the Alabama Division of Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries (WFF) District I Office. Based on that tip WFF, with assistance from the Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency, began a coordinated effort to locate Durham before he entered Alabama. Safeguarding Alabama's deer resources against CWD merits everyone's assistance, said Kevin Dodd, WFF Law Enforcement Chief. It's easy to take a 'not my business' approach. However, the caller was concerned about protecting his children's deer hunting future and decided to report the suspicious activity. He is to be commended for being part of the solution. CWD apparently does not transmit to humans, but it has the capability of decimating deer herds in the wild. It's identified by listlessness, weight loss and pneumonia, and is always fatal. It's transmitted by deer saliva, and those infected salivate heavily. It's centered in the Rocky Mountain states, but there are also concentrations in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois, Pennsylvania/West Virginia, and in the Canadian Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. For a map of CWD states, visit www.outdooralabama.com/map-cwd-north-america. There have been minor outbreaks in a number of other states as well, which is why Alabama has a blanket rule that bans all import of whole deer from any other state, period. It affects both whitetails and mule deer as well as elk and moose. The only cure is to kill all animals in the affected areas, which has led to the destruction of a number of deer farm herds in recent years. Alabamians who hunt in CWD-affected states are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the CWD carcass ban. The ADCNR says it's critical to completely debone the animal, remove and dispose of any brain or spinal tissue from skull plates, raw capes and hides before returning to Alabama. Root structures and other soft tissue should also be removed from all teeth. Additionally, skull plates must be cleaned with a bleach-based solution. Finished taxidermy products and tanned hides are not affected by the ban."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":529,"title":"Opioid Addiction Targeted by Surgeon General","class":1,"body":"In a first-of-its-kind report, the U.S. Surgeon General last week announced plans to tackle alcohol and drug abuse—especially opioid addiction—urging doctors, policymakers and the public to ramp up efforts to combat the the growing U.S. healthcare crisis. Consumer Reports medical advisors have long urged a cautious approach for people using potent painkillers like Oxycontin and Vicodin and the doctors prescribing them, and offered alternative solutions to pain management. Underpinning the report, Facing Addiction in America, by U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy, M.D., M.B.A, is his desire for us to understand that addiction is an illness—not a moral failing. Murthy's report details the scientific evidence that demonstrates the value of early medical intervention and the success of addiction treatments for all types of substance addiction. He notes that both of these actions are underutilized by healthcare professionals, citing that only 1 in 10 people receive the treatment they need to resolve their addiction. Opioid Addiction a Key Concern While the report takes on alcohol, illicit and prescription pills of all kinds, it makes a special focus on substantially reducing prescription opioid addiction and misuse. The Surgeon General’s underscored the need for urgent action—and calling for more responsible prescribing by doctors. As clinicians, we have to ask ourselves, ‘do the harms outweigh the benefits of prescribing this medicine?’ said Murthy, M.D., M.B.A., during a media call last week on the launch of the report. The report urges healthcare professionals to better adhere to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention new opioid prescribing guidelines. The pathway between the relief of pain and ‘doing no harm’ is frequently a narrow one for your doctor, says Consumer Reports chief medical adviser Marvin M. Lipman, M.D. But the dreadful results of inappropriate opioid prescribing have tipped the scales in favor of revising your doctor's prescribing habits. Since 2000, the rate of overdose deaths involving opioids—Fentanyl, Percocet, Vicodin, and others—has increased by 200 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And in 2014 alone, nearly 30,000 people died from a drug overdose involving some type of opioid, including prescription pain relievers and heroin—more than in any previous year on record. How to Stay Safe According to recent prescribing guidelines issued by the CDC, doctors must change how often they prescribe drugs like Oxycotin, Percocet or Vicodin, and for which patients. No longer can doctor's assume that people who are in legitimate pain are not at risk for opioid addiction, as been standard medical practice for decades, the report notes. What's important is that the CDC’s analysis shows that the longer a person takes opioids, especially at the higher doses, the greater the risk for serious effects, including addiction, overdoses, and death. That’s true even if you use the drugs legitimately to combat pain. While most people taking opioids don’t become addicted, nearly everyone who takes the drugs longer than a couple of weeks or so becomes dependent on them. According to the CDC, you can lessen that risk by, whenever possible, not taking the drugs longer term. That means if you’re treating severe short-term pain from an injury or surgery, taking a shorter course—three day’s worth—is a better bet. If your pain persists after a few days, discuss with your doctor non-opioid alternatives, including other types of pain drugs as well as nondrug approaches, such as exercise and cognitive behavior therapy. There are pain-relieving treatments and medications other than opioids that are of use in helping benign but chronic pain syndromes, adds Lipman."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":530,"title":"CDC reveals top five causes of death in America, and they’re preventable","class":1,"body":"In 2014, these are the five leading causes of death in the United States, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The good news is that many of these can be prevented. Another good news is that three out of the five leading causes of death in the country fell from 2010 to 2014. Two years ago, the federal CDC found that the five leading causes of death for Americans under the age of 80 were cancers, stroke, heart, unintentional injuries or accidents, and chronic lower respiratory diseases like bronchitis, asthma and emphysema. These causes accounted for sixty-three percent of deaths from all causes in 2014. It also estimates that at least fifteen percent of the cancer deaths, forty-three percent of accidents, thirty-three percent of chronic lower respiratory diseases, and thirty percent of heart-linked deaths were preventable. In a press release, the CDC’s Director, Tom Frieden, said that fewer Americans are dying from such causes which are preventable. However, deaths from overdose are increasing as opioid epidemic rise. Frieden, MD MPH, added that there are still large differences between states in all causes of death which are avoidable. It shows that the government can save more lives through promotion of treatment and prevention which are available today. Compared with 2010, in 2010, preventable deaths from cancer decreased twenty-five percent which was driven by a twelve percent decrease in the age-adjusted death rate from lung cancer. The CDC also saw stroke deaths decreased by eleven percent, and heart deaths by four percent. However, more deaths from accidents or unintentional injuries were recorded due to drug poisoning and falls; that year, the CDC saw a twenty-three percent increase. Deaths due to chronic lower respiratory diseases, or CLRD, also increased by one percent which is a statistically nonsignificant increase, the federal agency said. Knowing estimates of preventable deaths is an important tool that can help federal and state officials establish strategies, priorities and goals, the CDC explained. Also, health care providers can prevent such deaths by offering services for prevention, like counseling, coaching on how to end smoking, how to avoid injuries, and preventing stroke and heart disease. Of all the top causes of deaths in America, heart is arguably getting the most focus not only in media, but also via government letters. Clinicians suggest healthy lifestyle to avoid heart diseases, with more exercise, avoid smoking, knowing blood pressure and keeping it under control, getting tested for diabetes (if the person has it) and keep it under control, and eating more fruits and vegetables. Maintaining a healthy weight is also important, experts added. Meanwhile, fewer Americans are smoking according to an August 2016 survey by Gallup. Compared to 2009 with twenty-one percent, only eighteen percent of Americans said they smoked or used tobacco products. That said, fewer people confirmed that they eat healthy, or eat food that promote good health. The poll said that sixty-four point two percent of Americans reported that they ate healthy all day yesterday which is one of the lowest since 2008. U.S. adults who ate healthy peaked at sixty-seven point seven percent in 2010."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":531,"title":"People are worried Trump will stop climate progress. The numbers suggest he can’t","class":1,"body":"The outcome of the U.S. presidential election injected uncertainty into last week’s climate negotiations in Marrakech – but how large is the potential for disruption of global climate progress? Recent news coverage points to conclusions at both extremes. Only by reviewing the numbers can we distinguish the signal from the noise. First, let’s consider the limited scale of countries’ current pledges relative to overall emissions reductions needed to keep the global mean temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a target for the Paris climate agreement. While countries’ pledges are expected to lead to flattening growth in annual emissions globally out to 2030, they are far from the more than 50 percent drop in emissions needed by 2050 to keep on track for the 2 C limit. Even before the election, commitments had to be ratcheted up. This remains true today. However, current commitments are also expected to drive substantial clean energy innovation. This near-term energy innovation is critical to encourage countries to set more ambitious, longer-term emissions targets. For example, in a renewables-focused scenario, we estimate that by 2030, globally-installed wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) capacity could grow by factors of nearly 3 and 5, respectively, under current commitments. Electricity costs from these technologies could fall by 25 percent and 50 percent. Significant cost reductions are possible in these and other clean energy technologies, such as stationary energy storage, from the private research and development, economies of scale, and learning by doing that accompanies growing markets. History has shown that rapid and sustained improvement can result. Furthermore, changes in U.S. federal policy alone can only have a limited effect on global emissions reductions and clean energy expansion under the Paris agreement, when we consider state action and changes already set in motion in the private sector. In the electricity sector, if U.S. states continue pursuing their existing renewables portfolio standards (RPS) – and if China, the European Union, India, and other countries stay on track to meet their emissions targets under the Paris agreement – then changes to U.S. federal policy may only result in a 2 percent reduction of global solar PV and wind power capacity in 2030. This number represents a scenario without the US Clean Power Plan (CPP), and with only state-level RPS contributions of 45 to 53 gigawatts of new solar photovoltaic and wind capacity by 2030. This amounts to roughly 60 percent of the new solar PV and wind capacity expected under the CPP. This figure is a low estimate because it does not include federal tax credits with bipartisan support, other state-level incentives, or locations where wind (and even solar) is becoming cost-effective without government incentives. In the transportation sector, federal fuel economy standards have already initiated changes to the vehicle fleet, with effects that will persist throughout a one- or two-term presidential administration. Most manufacturers have incorporated the Environmental Protection Agency’s light duty vehicle standards, approved in 2012, into their plans up to the 2019 model year. Fuel economy standards for heavy-duty vehicles, expected to reduce that sector’s emissions by 25 percent, were carefully crafted with industry input to be technologically feasible and cost-effective. Additionally, 37 states and the District of Columbia provide incentives for purchasing hybrid and electric vehicles, and 10 states (representing one quarter of all miles driven) have voluntarily adopted California’s stricter vehicle standards. These state policies create a guaranteed market that will drive innovation and further reduce prices for low-emissions vehicles across the country. (Several low-emissions personal vehicles that meet the U.S. 2030 target are already cost-competitive.) The emissions impacts of changes to U.S. federal policy are more difficult to assess. Many factors will play a role, such as the shares of natural gas and coal in the electricity sector, as well as energy efficiency investments that drive down demand. However, we estimate that the U.S. can achieve the majority share of its original 2025 emissions reduction target even with federal policy changes. More ambitious state policies would further compensate for changes at the federal level. On the basis of these numbers alone, it’s clear that the United States will continue to contribute to clean energy market expansion and emissions reduction even with changes to federal policy. Additionally, several states are well positioned to increase their clean energy ambition to keep the U.S. mostly on track to meeting its near-term clean energy commitments, and to keep longer-term emissions goals – not yet implemented in policy – within reach. Moreover, many countries are likely to stick to their climate plans. China, which represents more than one third of the expected solar PV and wind capacity growth between now and 2030, has indicated it plans to do so. The EU commitment looks strong as well. The demand created in China, the EU, and India – together accounting for over 50 percent of global solar PV and wind capacity additions by 2030 – argues for companies to stay competitive in these markets. In purely economic terms, there are arguments for moving ahead with climate and clean energy policies. Much innovation in wind and solar is expected through local installation experience. The international competitiveness of Danish firms in off-shore wind due to experience supported by national policies is well documented. In the U.S., the growth of the solar and wind industry is increasingly entangled with individual states’ economic development, regardless of their support for climate policy. The United States must aggressively reduce its emissions for global climate change mitigation to be successful, and should contribute its fair share to clean energy research – but over the course of one or two terms, a Trump administration alone cannot halt global progress. Even if U.S. federal policy is diminished, individual states are well equipped to take up the slack. Moral and ethical considerations aside, self-interest should induce national, state, and local governments and companies to step forward to compete in clean energy markets, rather than hold back until the next U.S. president is elected.

{"id":532,"title":"NASA Team Claims ‘Impossible’ Space Engine Works—Get the Facts","class":1,"body":"After years of speculation, a maverick research team at NASA’s Johnson Space Center has reached a milestone that many experts thought was impossible. This week, the team formally published their experimental evidence for an electromagnetic propulsion system that could power a spacecraft through the void—without using any kind of propellant. According to the team, the electromagnetic drive, or EmDrive, converts electricity into thrust simply by bouncing around microwaves in a closed cavity. In theory, such a lightweight engine could one day send a spacecraft to Mars in just 70 days. (Find out why Elon Musk thinks a million people could live on Mars by the 2060s.) The long-standing catch is that the EmDrive seemingly defies the laws of classical physics, so even if it’s doing what the team claims, scientists still aren’t sure how the thing actually works. Previous reports about the engine have been met with heaping doses of skepticism, with many physicists relegating the EmDrive to the world of pseudoscience. Now, though, the latest study has passed a level of scrutiny by independent scientists that suggests the EmDrive really does work. Is this the beginning of a revolution in space travel—or just another false start for the impossible spaceship engine? WHAT’S AN EMDRIVE? First proposed nearly 20 years ago by British scientist Roger Shawyer, this incarnation of the EmDrive has been developed and tested by engineers at NASA’s Advanced Propulsion Physics Research Laboratory, informally known as Eagleworks. Put simply, the Eagleworks EmDrive generates thrust by bouncing around electromagnetic energy (in this case, microwave photons) in a closed, cone-shaped chamber. As those photons collide with the chamber’s walls, they somehow propel the device forward, despite the fact that nothing is released from the chamber. By contrast, ion drives now in use on some NASA spacecraft create thrust by ionizing a propellant, often xenon gas, and shooting out beams of charged atoms. What this means, if the EmDrive withstands further scrutiny, is that future vehicles could hurtle through space without needing to carry literal tons of propellant. In space travel, staying light is crucial for fast and cost-effective trips over long distances. WHY DOES THIS ENGINE BREAK THE LAWS OF PHYSICS? Way back in 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published three laws of motion that formed the foundation for classical mechanics. Over the intervening three centuries, those laws have been tested and verified over and over again. (Also see Isaac Newton’s Lost Alchemy Recipe Rediscovered.) The trouble is, the EmDrive violates Newton’s third law, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposing reaction. This principle explains, for instance, why a canoe glides forward when someone paddles. The force applied as the paddle moves through the water propels the canoe in the opposite direction. It’s also why jet engines generate thrust: As the engine expels hot gases backward, the plane moves forward. Weirdly, the EmDrive doesn’t expel anything at all, and that doesn’t make sense in light of Newton’s third law or another tenet of classical mechanics, the conservation of momentum. If the EmDrive moves forward without expelling anything out the back, then there’s no opposing force to explain the thrust. It’s a bit like arguing that a person inside a car could propel it forward by repeatedly hitting the steering wheel, or that the crew of a spaceship could fly the craft to their destination simply by pushing on the walls. HAS ANYONE TRIED TO TEST IT BEFORE? In 2014, the Eagleworks group made waves when it announced the results of early tests suggesting the EM engine actually worked. Since then, the group has tested the EmDrive in increasingly more stringent conditions, including the latest experiments. Other groups have also developed and tested various incarnations of the EmDrive. In addition to experiments conducted by U.S., European, and Chinese academics, there’s a community of DIY EmDrivers who are busy making and testing their own impossible physics engines. But no one has been able to say conclusively that such a drive has worked as described. (Let’s be real: Physicists don’t like seemingly miraculous inventions.) SO WHAT’S DIFFERENT NOW? Now, the NASA team behind the EmDrive has published the results of their experiments in a peer-reviewed journal. While peer review doesn’t guarantee that a finding or observation is valid, it does indicate that at least a few independent scientists looked over the experimental setup, results, and interpretation and found it all to be reasonable. In this paper, the team describes how they tested the EmDrive in a near vacuum, similar to what it would encounter in space. Scientists placed the engine on a device called a torsion pendulum, fired it up, and determined how much thrust it generated based on how much it moved. Turns out, the EmDrive is capable of producing 1.2 millinewtons per kilowatt of energy, according to the authors’ estimates. That’s not a lot of thrust compared to more traditional engines, but it’s far from insignificant considering the completely fuel-free setup. And to put that in perspective, light sails and other related technologies—which are propelled by the push of photons—only generate a fraction of that thrust, between 3.33 and 6.67 micronewtons per kilowatt. Before now, one of the major criticisms about the EmDrive is that it warmed up while activated, which some scientists suggested could heat the surrounding air and generate thrust. Testing the device in a vacuum resolved some of that criticism, though there are still loads of caveats that need addressing. OK. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? First things first: It’s still unclear that the EmDrive truly generates thrust, a claim that will require further verification. But people are already tossing around ideas for how the drive might work. The Eagleworks team that tested the EmDrive thinks the microwave photons push against quantum vacuum virtual plasma, or a roiling sea of particles that flit in and out of existence at the quantum level. The trouble is, there’s no evidence that quantum vacuum virtual plasma is even a real thing, says Caltech physicist Sean Carroll. Quantum vacuums exist, he says, but they don’t generate a plasma that’s available for pushing against. In their paper, the Eagleworks team invokes an idea called pilot-wave theory to describe how the quantum vacuum could be used to generate thrust, while noting that such interpretations are not the dominant view of physics today. Mike McCulloch, a physicist at the University of Plymouth, argues that the EmDrive is evidence of a new theory of inertia that involves something called Unruh radiation, a sort of heat experienced by accelerating objects. In his telling, since the wide and narrow ends of the EmDrive’s cone permit different wavelengths of Unruh radiation, the inertia of the photons inside the cavity must change as they bounce back and forth—which must produce thrust in order to conserve momentum. But McCulloch’s model assumes that Unruh radiation is real—it hasn’t been experimentally confirmed—and also suggests that the speed of light varies within the EmDrive’s cavity, which violates Einstein’s theory of special relativity, according to Rochester Institute of Technology physicist Brian Koberlein. It’s also possible that some of the energy generated as a body accelerates is being stored within the body itself, to put it very, very simply—there are also gravitational interactions and transient inertial mass fluctuations involved. This could explain how the craft moves through space without violating the conservation of momentum, says physicist Jim Woodward, who proposed what’s called the Mach effect theory in 1990. COULD THIS STILL BE BUNK? For sure. There’s a long history of findings that seemingly defy the laws of physics (faster-than-light neutrinos, anyone?) that were ultimately shown to be casualties of faulty experimentation. In this paper, the authors identify and discuss nine potential sources of experimental errors, including rogue air currents, leaky electromagnetic radiation, and magnetic interactions. Not all of them could be completely ruled out, and more experimentation is definitely needed … perhaps next."}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":533,"title":"Dementia rates show 'signs of falling'","class":1,"body":"There is growing evidence that the dementia crisis may not be as bad as first feared, say researchers. A study suggests the proportion of elderly people developing dementia is falling in the US - backing up similar findings in the UK and Europe. Data from 21,057 people over the age of 65 in the US showed the proportion with dementia fell from 11.6% in 2000 to 8.8% in 2012. The findings were published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. There is a suggestion that higher levels of education are protecting the brain from the disease. One expert said the results were incredibly important for the world. Similar studies in Europe, published in the Lancet Neurology last year, suggested dementia rates had fallen in the UK and among Spanish men and had stabilised in other European countries. Brain protection Prof Kenneth Langa, who conducted the latest study at the University of Michigan, said: Our results add to a growing body of evidence that this decline in dementia risk is a real phenomenon, and that the expected future growth in the burden of dementia may not be as extensive as once thought. The slow decline in brain function is irreversible - there are no drugs or treatments - so finding ways of preventing the condition is hugely important. Education has long been suspected to play a role, and the study found that while the dementia rate fell, the average time older adults had spent in school or university increased from 11.8 years in 2000 to 12.7 years in 2012. It is possible that the mental challenge of education helps protect brain cells from dying later in life, or that once neurons start to die, education helps the rest of the brain rewire and compensate to prevent the symptoms of dementia appearing. Old manImage copyrightTHINKSTOCK Good physical health is also thought to help protect the brain. However, the study showed levels of diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure all increased between 2000 and 2012. It is possible that better medication dampened their negative impact. Prof Carol Brayne, who conducted the European analysis and is from the University of Cambridge, said the US study added strong further evidence that rates were declining in some countries. She said education appeared to be significant and that people with higher levels of education seemed to defer dementia until later in life. She told the BBC News website: These findings are incredibly important for the world and underlie the importance of access to education. But it is likely to be a combination of risk factors - better health from conception, vaccinations, access to education, medical care, not smoking - that taken together will have an impact. Prof Brayne added that identifying what could help stave off dementia would ensure we don't go backwards, otherwise the gains we've had won't be had by future generations. Biggest killer However, the number of people affected could still soar. The falling rate could be overwhelmed by the rising numbers of people living into old age. Despite a falling dementia rate, the disease still became the biggest killer in England and Wales last year. There are also fewer people dying from other diseases, as well as changes to the way deaths are being recorded that move dementia up the rankings. Hilary Evans, the chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, said the latest study was a cause for optimism but dementia remained the greatest medical challenge. He said: While these findings present a positive picture, we must not forget that there are still huge numbers of people living with dementia. This useful study adds to emerging evidence suggesting that dementia prevalence may be either declining or stabilising in parts of Western Europe and the US, but there are still many unanswered questions. We need to understand what is driving this apparent change in dementia risk if we are to harness this knowledge to provide crucial public health advice. Drs Ozioma Okonkwo and Sanjay Asthana, from the University of Wisconsin, said: The growing consistency of reports indicating a potential decrease in its prevalence is encouraging. The focus now should be on better understanding the factors that underlie this trend and translating that knowledge into interventions that can reduce the risk of dementia for both individuals and society as a whole."}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":534,"title":"WHO Declares End Of International Zika Emergency Still, the virus remains a threat.","class":1,"body":"The World Health Organization on Friday declared that Zika no longer constitutes an international emergency, but it stressed a need for a long-term effort to address the virus, which has been linked to birth defects and neurological complications. Officials on WHO’s Emergency Committee made clear the Zika still constitutes a global public health threat. They warned the virus, which has been found in 60 countries since the outbreak was identified last year in Brazil, will continue to spread where mosquitoes that carry the virus are present. Removing the international emergency designation will put Zika in a class with other diseases, such as dengue, that pose serious risks and require continued research, including efforts to develop effective vaccines. But some public health experts worried that losing the international emergency label could slow research into the virus, which continues to cause infections in the United States and elsewhere. WHO in February declared Zika a public health emergency of international concern - a designation under international law that compels countries to report outbreaks. The moved was part of an effort to determine if Zika was linked to reports in Brazil of the severe birth defect microcephaly and the neurological disorder Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Traditionally, Zika had only been thought to cause mild symptoms. That goal has been met, said Dr David Heymann, chair of the Zika Emergency Committee and a professor of infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in a conference call with reporters following the committee meeting in Geneva. Because research has now shown that Zika and microcephaly are linked, the committee felt that what is best now is a very robust technical response to the virus, and that would require work within WHO, he said. The U.N. health agency maintained recommendations including that people exposed to the Zika virus should take preventive measures for six months to avoid sexual transmission. It remains crucially important that pregnant women avoid traveling to areas with local transmission of Zika, because of the devastating complications that can occur in fetuses that become infected during pregnancy, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said in a statement. Some experts, expressed concern that losing the international emergency designation might result in less support for research into the virus. I think WHO’s decision is unwise, said Lawrence Gostin, a global health law expert from Georgetown University. Although Zika’s spread has waned, it still holds the potential for an explosive epidemic. If it were to reemerge in the Americas or jump to another part of the world, it would significantly threaten a new generation of children born with disabilities such as microcephaly. Gostin said the international response to Zika has been lethargic and WHO’s decision will give countries even less reason to invest in preparedness and research. At the press conference, Dr. Peter Salama, executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, insisted that WHO is not downgrading the importance of Zika. By framing Zika as a longer program of work, Salama said, we are sending the message that Zika is here to stay and WHO’s response is here to stay in a very robust manner. Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said public health emergency declarations help direct the world’s attention to a disease, and the Zika emergency designation accomplished that goal. But much work remains to be done, including the development of a vaccine, he added. The removal of the emergency declaration doesn’t change that fact. BRAZIL HARD HIT There have been some 2,300 confirmed cases worldwide of babies born with microcephaly, most in Brazil, but the figure is most likely a significant under-estimate, Salama said. Heymann said the Brazilian government is conducting studies to look for additional factors that could explain the high number of cases there, particularly in the northeastern part of the country, but so far those studies have turned up nothing. Salama said 28 countries and territories have now reported microcephaly and 19 countries have reported Guillain-Barre Syndrome. He said it is very likely we will see many reports of microcephaly, including countries in Latin America such as Guatemala and Colombia. The U.S. CDC said WHO’s announcement does not change the urgent need to better understand Zika’s impact on fetuses and infants, to develop better diagnostics and to make vaccines that can prevent infection and spread."}
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":535,"title":"10 deadly foods you probably have in your kitchen","class":1,"body":"Humans are one of the few creatures on this planet who have the capability of ignoring our basic survival instinct. We jump out of perfectly good airplanes — something that still sets off alarms in the most veteran skydivers — and we push ourselves to the edge of death and back with physical demands on our bodies that defy reason with activities like ultra-marathons in the desert, living in microgravity, and setting the world record for holding one’s breath under water. Yet as contradictory as it sounds, testing these limits is probably what makes us feel the most human or the most attuned to nature and our own potential — particularly when it comes to soaring above the skies, jumping eight feet in the air… and eating the most bizarre, even dangerous, dishes set in front of us on the dinner table. What are some of the deadliest foods the world has ever seen? Poisonous or harmful by design, not accident, and something that has us questioning our sanity when we choose to take a bite? 1. Fruit Seeds Like apples, cherry pits contain a type of hydrogen cyanide called prussic acid. Don't go eating a cup of ground pits, or peach and apricot pits for that matter. 2. Rhubarb Rhubarb leaves contain oxalic acid, which causes kidney stones. It'll take 11 pounds of leaves to be fatal, but much less to make you seriously ill. 3. Nutmeg Nutmeg is actually a hallucinogenic. Yes, you can trip on it, but it's said that eating just 0.2 oz of nutmeg could lead to convulsions, and 0.3 oz could lead to seizures. Eating one whole will supposedly lead to a type of nutmeg psychosis, which includes a sense of impending doom. 4. Potatoes Glycoalkaloids, also found in nightshade, can be found in the leaves, stems, and sprouts of potatoes. It can also build up in the potato if it's left too long, especially in the light. Eating glycoalkaloids will lead to cramping, diarrhea, confused headaches, or even coma and death. It's said that just 3 to 6 mg per kilogram of body weight could be fatal. Avoid potatoes with a greenish tinge. 5. Almonds There are two variations of almonds, sweet almonds and bitter almonds. The bitter ones supposedly contain relatively large amounts of hydrogen cyanide. It's said that even eating just 7 - 10 raw bitter almonds can cause problems for adults, and could be fatal for children. 6. Raw Honey Because it doesn't go through the pasteurization process in which harmful toxins are killed, unpasteurized honey often contains grayanotoxin. That can lead to dizziness, weakness, excessive sweating, nausea, and vomiting that last for 24 hours. Typically just one tablespoon of concentrated grayanotoxin can cause the symptoms above. Consuming multiple tablespoons would be a bad idea. 7. Tomatoes The stems and leaves of tomatoes contain alkali poisons that can cause stomach agitation. Unripe green tomatoes have been said to have the same effect. You would need to consume vast quantities for it to be fatal. Not exactly high-risk, but you might avoid eating tomato leaves. 8. Tuna The danger in tuna is the mercury that the fish absorbs. Once in your body, mercury will either pass through your kidneys, or travel to your brain and supposedly drive you insane. The FDA recommends children and pregnant women do not consume tuna at all. While it's unlikely that eating a massive amount of tuna in one sitting will kill you, it's a good idea to monitor your weekly intake. Click here to visit the Environmental Working Group's tuna calculator to see how much is recommended. 9. Cassava The leaves and roots of cassava are surprisingly rich in cyanide. By this point, we may as well wish cyanide were the most delicious, sumptuous substance on the planet if we had to die to enjoy a bite… there is not much in the way of flavor, though. Cassava is a tropical vegetable originally from South America, but has gained popularity in Africa, particularly for its juice, which can be fermented to produce a drink called piwarry. 10. Cashews Raw cashews you might find in a supermarket are not actually raw, as they've been steamed to remove the urushiol, a chemical also found in poison ivy. This chemical can cause the same effect as poison ivy, or poison oak. High levels of urushiol can supposedly prove fatal. People who are allergic to poison ivy are likely to have a fatal allergic reaction to eating actual raw cashews."}

Microsoft has researched quantum computing for more than a decade. Now the company’s goal is to put the theory to work and create actual hardware and software. To that effect, Microsoft has put Todd Holmdahl—who was involved in the development of Kinect, HoloLens, and Xbox—to lead the effort to create quantum hardware and software. The company has also hired four prominent university professors to contribute to the company’s research. Quantum computers, in theory, can significantly outperform today’s supercomputers. The ultimate goal is to create universal quantum computers that can run all existing programs and conduct a wide range of calculations, much like today’s computers. Early quantum computers can be used to run only a limited number of applications. Companies like IBM, D-Wave, and Google are researching quantum computing. IBM researchers have said a universal quantum computer is still decades out, so their focus is on creating hardware targeted at solving specific problems. D-Wave and IBM have created quantum computers based on different theories, and the companies have bashed each other’s designs. D-Wave is trying to get more programmers to test its hardware so it can be used for more applications. It’s not known when Microsoft’s quantum hardware will come out. Like others, Microsoft will have to make quantum circuits on which it can test applications and tackle issues like error correction, fault tolerance, and gating. Practical hardware will be released only after a number of quantum computing issues are resolved. But Microsoft is already offering a simulation of quantum computers via a software toolkit. Conventional computers represent data in the forms of 1s and 0s, but quantum computers are far more complex. At the center of quantum computers are qubits, which can harness the laws of quantum mechanics to achieve various states. A qubit can hold a one and zero simultaneously and expand to states beyond that. Qubits allow quantum computers to calculate in parallel, making them more powerful than today’s fastest computers. But qubits can be fragile, and interference from matter or electromagnetic radiation can wreck a calculation. Researchers at Microsoft are working on an entirely new topological quantum computer, which uses exotic materials to limit errors. There are still questions about the viability of such materials and outcomes, so it could take a long time for Microsoft to make practical quantum circuits. Interest in quantum computing is growing as it becomes difficult to manufacture smaller chips to speed up PCs and servers. Neuromorphic chips and quantum circuits represent a way to move computing into the future. Microsoft’s new hires include Leo Kouwenhoven, a professor at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands; Charles Marcus, a professor at the University of Copenhagen; Matthias Troyer, a professor at ETH Zurich; and David Reilly, a professor at the University of Sydney in Australia. All of them are retaining their professor titles."}

The Connecticut Audubon Society on Tuesday released its 10th annual Connecticut State of the Birds report on Monday which painted a sobering portrait of bird species in the state, many of which are seeing drastic population drops over the past two or three decades. We have learned a lot about tidal marsh birds in the last ten years — that’s the good news. said UConn professor Chris Elphick, who specializes in wildlife species. The bad news is that many of these species are on a rapid trajectory to extinction’. He said that the salt march sparrow has seen its numbers decline at a rate of about 9 percent annually since the 1990s. And all of the other species that nest in the marshes are on the decline as well, he said. If you look at the marsh habitat, you’re seeing big changes in plant species because the marsh has been getting wetter over just the last ten years, he said. Sea level rise is happening and because of the effects of global warming, the marshes are changing. Bird conservationist and report co-author Patrick Comins agreed. Ten years ago, there were two endangered species and now nine more species have been added to that list since then. He said the long-tailed duck has seen its numbers decline by about 80 percent in the last four decades and a similar drop was seen with the semipalmated sandpiper. These were two of our most abundant species, he said. The king rail, the least bittern have seen similar declines. There are some bright spots, however. Connecticut Audubon’s Senior Director of Science and Conservation Milan G. Bull said that all of the efforts to bring back the piping plover has shown some success. There has also been improvement seen in the osprey population. But Bull said that policies put in place since the mid-20th century to preserve forests have worked almost too well. Now, he said, Connecticut has a lack of fields and grasslands, along with the species that need this habitat. We need the transitional forests — the shrub-scrub habitat — to maintain diversity, he said. Surprisingly, concern over the New England cottontail rabbit, which relies on this kind of habitat, has given many of these bird species a chance. Jenny Dickson, the supervising wildlife biologist for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said that conservationists have been able to move the needle through partnerships with private landowners, with other states and with municipalities in adding more grassland and scrubby habitat. But a lot of the habitats that grassland species like are also prime places for hard development, she said. Bull called for more money for research, particularly money to plan for sea-level rise, which will require the creation of landscapes that will will become future salt marshes. We’re also calling on funding to update the Connecticut Breeding Bird Atlas, Bull said. This hasn’t been updated in 25 or 30 years to give us a perspective that will help make the proper management decisions to help Connecticut’s bird populations."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":538,"title":"U.S. record heat poised to outpace record cold by factor of 15 late this century","class":1,"body":"It is a telltale sign of the warming climate in the Lower 48: Record high temperatures are set with ease and regularity while record lows are increasingly uncommon. This balance between record highs and lows is forecast to become even more lopsided in coming decades due to predicted climate warming, according to a new study. Heat records could outnumber cold records by a factor of 15 (plus or minus 8) later this century, according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. More and more frequently, climate change will affect Americans with record-setting heat, said Gerald Meehl, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and study lead author. Record-setting cold won’t altogether disappear, but will become rare, he said. The growing disparity between record warmth and record cold will be pushed along by a steady rise in the average temperature over the Lower 48. The temperature in the Lower 48 is projected to warm about 5.4 degrees (3 Celsius) by 2065, assuming emissions of heat-trapping gases from human activity continue at the current pace. An increase in average temperatures of a few degrees may not seem like much, Meehl said, but it correlates with a noticeable increase in days that are hotter than any in the record, and nights that will remain warmer than we’ve ever experienced in the past. The amount of warming will determine just how disproportionate the record heat is. If the climate warms 7.2 degrees (4 Celsius), 38 times as many record highs as record lows would be expected, Meehl said. But if warming is limited to 3.6 degrees (2 Celsius), record highs would outpace lows by a much lower factor of about 5.5 (range of 3 to 8). Every degree of warming makes a substantial amount of difference, Meehl said. Meehl’s latest work, with co-authors Claudia Tebaldi and Dennis Adams-Smith, builds on a study he published (with colleagues) in 2009. It found that, since 2000, about twice as many record highs as record lows had occurred in the continental U.S. If the climate was not changing, roughly an equal number of record highs and lows would have been expected. The 2009 study also projected the number of record highs and lows into the future. But it found the underlying model was predicting too many record highs compared to reality. So the new study investigated the reasons the earlier model erred to make a more reliable forecast, more consistent with observations. Since Meehl’s 2009 study, record highs have continued to greatly outnumber record lows but with considerable year-to-year fluctuation. For example, the ratio was about 5:1 in 2012, the warmest year on record in the U.S., but about 1:1 in 2013 and 2014, when the polar vortex was disrupted and frigid air gripped large portions of the nation. This year, the nation has witnessed five to six times as many record highs as record lows. A disproportionate number of record highs has also been seen in individual cities. In Washington, for example, record highs have outpaced lows by an 8 to 1 ratio since 2000, and more than 16 to 1 since 2010. (The increase in record highs in Washington may, in part, be due to urbanization around the observing site. Meehl said in an interview that, for his study, he relied on data sets for which methods were developed to correct for urbanization.) In other parts of the world, the ratio of record highs to record lows has also become increasingly skewed. In Australia, warm records outnumbered cold records by more than 12 to 1 from 2000 to 2014, according to a study published last year. [The simple statistic that perfectly captures what climate change means] These changes pose adaptation challenges to both human and natural systems, said Tebaldi, also at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Only a substantial mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions may stop this increase, or at least slow down its pace."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":539,"title":"The Science Of How Solar Systems Begin","class":1,"body":"The question of where do solar systems come from has now been scientifically answered and verified. Deep inside star-forming nebulae, dense regions of gas collapse to become hot and dense at their centers. These central regions first glow in infrared light, while the material surrounding the center pancakes into a disk shape. The disk rotates, and tiny densities imperfections form within it. In the densest regions, mass begins to clump together, creating the first protoplanets. As more time passes, these infant planets accrue more and more matter, clearing their orbits and creating large gaps in the protoplanetary disk. Meanwhile, gravitational collapse causes the central protostar to heat up. Once a critical threshold is reached, nuclear fusion begins in the stellar core, and the protostar becomes a full-fledged star. It’s then a race for the protoplanets to grow as quickly as possible and hang onto the material they’ve accrued, while the central star’s radiation works to burn it all off and eject it. Meanwhile, gravitational interactions cause ejections or mergers, leaving only a few planets. By time the present day arrives, all we can see are the solar system’s survivors.

{"id":540,"title":"Young African women are especially vulnerable to HIV/AIDS","class":1,"body":"Young women in sub-Saharan Africa are living through a particularly dangerous time when it comes to risk of HIV infection, according to the annual World AIDS Day report of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). About 19% of the estimated 2.1 million new cases worldwide in 2015—the most recent data for most analyses in the report—occurred in females between the ages of 15 and 24. And younger women in some places are at far higher risk than males of the same age; in southern Africa, for example, 91% of new infections in the 15-to-19-year-old group were in adolescent girls. Young women are in an age group that is the least likely to have taken an HIV test and know their status. It’s really amazing, says UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé. The reasons are complex, according to the report. Many young women do not perceive that they are at risk, and they live in what UNAIDS calls challenging environments, with insufficient access to food and education. In addition, many are involved in relationships with older men. The new update for World AIDS Day, 1 December, offers a far more nuanced take on the epidemic than it has in previous years. For the first time, the report examines the disease in four age brackets that it calls the life-cycle approach to HIV. UNAIDS suggests this breakdown—0 to 14, 15 to 24, 25 to 49, and 50-plus—should lead to a clearer view of the epidemic’s complex dynamics and a more targeted response. One of the most surprising details is that Nigeria alone accounts for more than one-fourth of the 150,000 new infections in children last year. (Children are defined as 14 and younger; some of their infections occur during birth and some during breastfeeding.) Sidibé says he is more disappointed than surprised by the finding. It’s a little bit our collective failure, including mine. Two factors underlie the problem in Nigeria, Sidibé says: little effort to focus resources on the regions of the country that have the biggest problems, and no strong culture of accountability to ensure funds are well spent. I didn’t take the same bold approach I took in South Africa with Nigeria, Sidibé says. That should be my major new agenda. In South Africa, more than 95% of HIV-infected pregnant women receive lifesaving antiretrovirals (ARVs), which also prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). Nigeria is still analyzing its data, but UNAIDS told Science that the latest figures suggest that about 30% of HIV-infected pregnant women in that country were receiving ARVs. Other trends are encouraging, according to the report. Roughly half, or 18.2 million, of the estimated 36.7 million HIV-infected people in the world have access to ARV treatment. New infections in children globally dropped 51% between 2010 and 2015, thanks to widespread programs to prevent MTCT. Annual AIDS-related deaths fell from 2 million in 2010 to 1.1 million. In poor and rich countries alike, people are living longer with HIV/AIDS, thanks to effective ARV treatment. The oldest group of HIV-infected people, 50-plus years of age, is growing and now accounts for 17% of the total. And if treatment continues to become more widely available, as hoped, the number of HIV-infected people in this oldest age bracket could jump by 47% over the next 4 years. But there’s grim news as well. The number of new infections in men and women between 25 and 49 years old has not changed. Not surprisingly, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, and sex workers accounted for 45% of the new infections in 2014. Although the risks are well known, few countries and cities have mounted comprehensive responses for key populations, which often face significant stigma and discrimination as well as laws that punish them for their behavior. Funding remains an issue. Last year, roughly $19 billion was spent to combat HIV/AIDS in low- and middle-income countries, which are hardest hit by the epidemic, and just over half that money came from the countries’ own budgets. But UNAIDS says an additional $7 billion is needed each year to close gaps in prevention and treatment. Reaching and sustaining this level of investment until 2030, and focusing these resources on delivering the most effective HIV services to the people in greatest need across the life cycle, will result in millions of additional lives saved and tens of millions of additional HIV infections averted, the report concludes."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":541,"title":"Updated: Drilling of dinosaur-killing impact crater explains buried circular hills","class":1,"body":"UPDATE: Today, scientists published their first results from a drilling expedition into Chicxulub crater, the buried remnants of an asteroid impact off the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico that killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Their discovery of shocked, granite rocks from deep in the crust placed out of order on top of sedimentary rocks validates the dynamic collapse theory of formation for Chicxulub’s peak ring, the scientists says. Chicxulub is the only well-preserved crater on Earth with a peak ring, but they abound elsewhere in the inner solar system. Last month, scientists using instruments on a NASA lunar mission showed that the peak rings within the Orientale impact basin were likely to have formed in a similar way as at Chicxulub. Here is our original story: Scientists have reached ground zero for one of the world’s most famous cataclysms. Burrowing into the impact structure responsible for the demise of the dinosaurs, a team of researchers has achieved one of its main goals, with rocks brought up from 670 meters beneath the sea floor off the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. These core samples contain bits of the original granite bedrock that was the unlucky target of cosmic wrath 66 million years ago, when a large asteroid struck Earth, blasted open the 180-kilometer-wide Chicxulub crater, and led to the extinction of most life on the planet. We’re feeling pretty good, said co–chief scientist Sean Gulick in an interview from the deck of a drilling platform 30 kilometers offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. I’m not getting much sleep out here, so we’re little delirious. Although scientists have drilled into the buried crater before on land, this is the first offshore effort, and also the first to go after the crater’s peak ring—a circular ridge inside the crater rim that’s characteristic of the solar system’s largest impact craters. Astronomers see peak rings on the moon, Mars, and Mercury, but they have never been able to sample one on Earth until now. The team has already been charting the return of life after the worldwide die-off in cores from higher up in the hole. By examining peak ring rocks closely, they hope to test models of crater formation and determine whether the crater itself was one of the first habitats for microbial life after the impact. The peak ring formed in a matter of minutes. Just after the impact, deep granite bedrock, flowing like a liquid, rebounded into a central tower as tall as 10 kilometers before collapsing into the circular ridge. Next, the peak ring was covered by a layer of jumbled-up rocks, called a breccia, that contains chunks of blasted-up rock and impact melt. Then, in the hours that followed, ocean tsunamis dumped huge amounts of sandy sediment in the giant hole in Earth. Further deposition would come slowly, as life returned to the seas, and layers of limestone were built up in the ensuing millions of years. Last week, researchers brought up a 3-meter core section from a depth of 670 meters that contained bits of granite along with minerals originally deposited in hot, fluid-filled cracks—the first sign that the team had entered the peak ring. We predicted the peak ring would be a big hydrothermal system, says Gulick, a geophysicist at the University of Texas, Austin. He says it may be several more days of drilling before granite dominates the core samples and the team can declare itself entirely within the peak ring. However, Joanna Morgan, the other chief scientist at Imperial College London, thinks the presence of any granite at all signifies that the team is now working within the peak ring layer. How far down into the peak ring is the peak ring? Gulick asks. It’s almost a semantic argument. Another bone of contention for the team concerns the boundary between the Cretaceous—the last age of the dinosaurs—and the Paleogene, the period that began 66 million years ago. Traditionally, Morgan says, the K-Pg boundary, as it is known, has been defined by appearance of fossils of small shelled creatures called foraminifera. By that definition, the team crossed the K-Pg boundary last week, at a depth of 620 meters, when drillers left fossil-containing limestone layers and entered sandy tsunami deposits. But Gulick points out that the tsunami deposits and impact breccia found between 620 and 670 meters all came after the impact itself, so they could technically be considered part of the Paleogene. He suggests that scientists instead call this thick section between the Cretaceous and Paleogene an event layer. The team of scientists living on board the drilling platform is now investigating the fractures and veins of minerals that precipitated out of hot solutions in the wake of the impact. Some of the minerals they’ve found suggest that, initially at least, the fluid-filled cracks were way too hot for life. But they are hoping to find signs of ancient and modern DNA. As hellish as the impact was, the team suspects that the buried peak ring itself may have been an early place for life to return, because of the nutrients in the hot fluid-filled fractures. As of 1 May, the team has reached a depth of 700 meters. It is funded to drill through the first week of June, and hopes to go as deep as 1500 meters. As the researchers move deeper into the harder granites of the peak ring, they will core more slowly, obtaining a 3-meter core about every 2 hours. They will look for evidence that the peak ring rocks are flipped out of order, with deeper rocks lying on top of rocks that originally sat more shallowly and contain minerals with higher levels of shocking. This would confirm one of the main models for peak ring formation. The drilling effort began at the beginning of April and is sponsored by the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). To avoid choppy ocean waters, the scientists are using a special vessel called a lift boat that has jacked itself up off the sea floor on three pylons. Morgan, who just arrived on the drilling platform over the weekend, says the mission is the culmination of years of effort that began with her first proposal to IODP in 1998. I had this dream we would drill this impact crater many years ago, she says. To see this immense structure and all the people here, it’s been really amazing."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":542,"title":"Can Science Save The World?","class":1,"body":"Human life is inherently uncertain. We are vulnerable and we know it. Throughout our long history, we humans have always looked for some means of control to master our uncertainty, especially as the possibilities of storm and darkness descend. For the last four centuries, science has played a particular — and particularly unique — role in addressing our uncertainty and our hope for control. Most importantly, in science's rise came a new kind of approach to the world that led with questions. Those inquiries were then followed closely by a method that was expected to yield shared answers. More than anything before it in human history, science was an approach to the world's uncertainty that demanded results. Answers needed to be worked out in public and they needed to be demonstrably true over and over again. In that new approach came a new kind of success. Ancient horrors like disease and hunger were, for the first time, beaten back. Human lifetimes were extended and then filled with unimaginable miracles like air travel and instantaneous communication. It was no accident that some saw in science the chance to build better versions of society. Science, they hoped, would lead us to a better world. It would save us even from ourselves. Were they right? Is science that longed-for place where we can put our trust for positive change in the midst of uncertainty? The answer to that question, like science itself, forces us to step up to the plate and ask what, exactly, we're bringing to the table in saving ourselves. History shows science has played its role in any number of dubious plans. For years, class prejudice and racism were cloaked behind the mantle of empirical science in the form of eugenics. Decades later, in a different domain, it was a misplaced confidence in technological progress that allowed us to miss the environmental impacts of our burgeoning society for so long. Both these examples illustrate an essential point that science, on its own, is not going to save us. But science is never on its own. Not a philosophy, not a religion, yet somehow touching the aspirations of both, science is more than just another human practice. It is unique and it is different. What makes science remarkable is that while we discovered its methods on our own, those methods are fundamentally a collaboration with the world. Science could not lead us to understanding if the world didn't have the possibility of being understood. In other words, there is no separating ourselves from the world because science is always a dialogue with something more than us. In that way, science calls us to see a hope and a power in our own capacities even as it reveals our interdependence with all things. With this grounding, science reveals critical aspects of our own human being that should not be forgotten, especially as we face into headwinds of uncertainty: We can only do great things when the circle is wide. Building space stations, eliminating disease and creating technological wonders demands the broadest possible effort. We cannot know where the next great idea will come from. No one group or people can corner the market on innovation. If we close down opportunities or the flow of ideas then we cannot but diminish our futures. We can only solve the hard problems by facing the hard truths. From Galileo on down, science has been the story of bravery in its commitment to seeking truth. Science gives us a means to talk to the world and learn how it behaves. Once that knowledge is gained, science presents us a long history of remaining steadfast in its defense. Because science is a dialogue between the world and us, it always begins with recognition of the other. It always starts with a curiosity about something that is more than just our personal stories. In that way, there has always been something essentially compassionate about the aspiration driving science. It's the same aspiration one finds in the best of human endeavors, be they aimed high toward the spirit or level toward the day-to-day. Openness, bravery, compassion: These are some of the lessons our profound success in science has taught us. As such, we can see how powerful a tool it can be in helping us forge a path toward better lives. But in the end, it's not science that will save the world. We will have to do that for ourselves."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":543,"title":"What scientists learned about whale sharks from the DNA they left behind in seawater","class":1,"body":"ale sharks are the largest fish in the ocean, but that doesn’t mean they’re easy to study. Scientists hoping to learn about them must spy on them from the air, tag them with devices so they can be tracked via satellite or sneak up on them to collect tissue samples for DNA analysis. But there may be an easier way. Researchers from Denmark and Qatar were able to learn about a group of whale sharks in the Persian Gulf simply by gathering the seawater around them and analyzing the environmental DNA it contained. With 20 samples of seawater, the research team was able to show that the recently discovered group of about 200 whale sharks were more closely related to whale sharks from the tropical portions of the Indian and Pacific oceans than to the colonies in the Atlantic. They were also able to estimate the number of breeding females in the population, according to a report published Monday in Nature Ecology & Evolution. The surface seawater samples were collected from 15 spots around the Al Shaheen oil field, where the whale sharks had been observed. Most of the samples contained just 1.5 liters of water. The researchers used DNA sequencing machines to decode the mitochondrial DNA extracted from the water. Mitochondrial DNA contains relatively few genes that are found in the part of the cell that converts food into energy, and it’s passed down from mother to child virtually unchanged. By zeroing in on a few sections of the mitochondrial genome, they were able to gauge the genetic diversity of the Persian Gulf whale sharks and compare them to their cousins in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. The team was able to check its work because it also had access to mitochondrial DNA from tissue samples collected from 61 whale sharks who swam in the same waters. The genetic fingerprints — collections of mutations known as haplotypes — were found in similar frequencies in both the seawater samples and the whale shark tissue, according to the study. What’s more, the catalog of haplotypes gathered from the seawater was more complete than the ones contained in the tissue samples alone. By counting up the accumulated mutations in certain parts of the genome, the researchers calculated that the whale sharks had an effective female population size of between 43,618 and 183,526. (This is the population of mothers that give birth to the next generation.) Doing the same analysis with the tissue samples instead of the DNA from seawater yielded a range of 85,087 to 351,654 females. Although the average of the two ranges were off by nearly a factor of two (71,600 versus 138,400), the fact that they overlapped at all shows that environmental DNA offers a promising way to estimate effective population size, the researchers wrote. The seawater samples also contained DNA fragments from mackerel tuna, which spawn near Al Shaheen. In fact, the greater the concentration of whale shark DNA, the greater the concentration tuna DNA. The reverse was also true — when whale shark DNA was relatively scarce, tuna DNA was scarce as well. This is most probably a sign that the whale sharks had come to the area to hunt the tuna, the researchers wrote. Other groups have already used environmental DNA to identify the inhabitants of certain waters, but this is the first study to show that environmental DNA can provide meaningful information about a population of animals and the biodiversity of their habitat, the authors wrote."}

{"id":545,"title":"Ancient Inscriptions Show Life Once Flourished in Jordan's 'Black Desert'","class":1,"body":"Thousands of inscriptions and petroglyphs dating back around 2,000 years have been discovered in the Jebel Qurma region of Jordan's Black Desert. They tell of a time when the now-desolate landscape was teeming with life. Nowadays, the Jebel Qurma area, and the Black Desert in general, is a highly inhospitable area, very arid and difficult to cross, said Peter Akkermans, a professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands who leads the Jebel Qurma Archaeological Landscape Project. Photos the team took of the modern-day landscape show little water, vegetation or wildlife. The inscriptions are written in Safaitic, an alphabetic script used by people who lived in parts of Syria, Jordan and Arabia in ancient times. Research is ongoing, but the archaeologists say their finds indicate that around 2,000 years ago, Jebel Qurma had trees, wildlife and a sizable human population. [See Images of the Petroglyphs in the Black Desert] When life flourished There are literally many thousands of Safaitic inscriptions and petroglyphs in the Jebel Qurma region, which suggests that people intensively used the area, Akkermans said. The petroglyphs, or rock art, show images of lions, gazelles, horses and large birds that may be ostriches. The inscriptions found near these petroglyphs tend to be very short. Most of the texts are simply names, like 'so-and-so, the son of so-and-so,' Akkermans said. Some texts contain information on what people were doing, with a few hinting that the people who inhabited Jebel Qurma had conflicts with the Nabataeans, a people who built the ancient city of Petra. I am on the lookout for the Nabataeans, one inscription reads. Other inscriptions tell of the challenges and setbacks encountered by the people who lived at Jebel Qurma. May there be strength against hunger, one inscription reads, while another was written by a man who said he was distraught over his beloved. Specialists are currently analyzing the texts and petroglyphs to gain a better understanding of what they mean and why they were created. The precise reason for producing rock art — inscriptions and/or representations — is still unclear and open to discussion. What was the message which the producers of the rock art tried to convey? Akkermans said. How a lush land became desolate In addition to the inscriptions and petroglyphs, archaeologists found the remains of camps, shelters and tombs used by the people of Jebel Qurma. Archaeologists believe that around 2,000 years ago, the people who lived in the region were nomadic. The team is looking for more evidence of what the environment was like in ancient times and how the landscape became the desolate place it is today. Our excavation at one site revealed masses of charcoal from the third century A.D., which appeared to represent several taxa [groups] of trees, which needed water year-round, Akkermans said. Hence, the conditions in at least the third century A.D. may have been quite different from today. This is certainly something I wish to explore in the next field seasons, by coring for pollen. A report describing the finds was published recently in the American Journal of Archaeology."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":546,"title":"Are Colds and Flu Worse in Women Than in Men?","class":1,"body":"Colds and the flu may take a bigger toll on women than men, according to a new study based on people's reports of their own symptoms.  The women in the study were more likely than the men in the study to report severe fatigue and muscle aches when they had a cold or the flu, according to the findings, presented in New Orleans last month at IDWeek 2016, a meeting of several organizations focused on infectious diseases. The findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. In addition, women's severe symptoms lasted longer than men's, according to the study participants' self-reports, the researchers found. [7 Absolutely Horrible Head Infections] In the study, the researchers compared self-reported cold and flu symptoms in 777 men and women who were seen between 2009 and 2014 at five military treatment facilities across the U.S., said study co-author Dr. Robert Deiss, a research physician with the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program, a program of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. The people in the study were either on active duty in the military or were family members of people in the military, he said. When the patients first went in for treatment, a health care worker took a nasal swab to determine what type of infection they had, and asked the patients about the symptoms they'd had since they became sick. The participants were also asked to start keeping a diary of their symptoms and the severity of those symptoms on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 indicating that they did not have the symptom, 1 indicating mild symptoms, 2 indicating moderate symptoms and 3 indicating severe symptoms, according to the study. The symptoms included lower-respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, difficulty breathing and chest pain; upper-respiratory symptoms, such as earaches, runny nose, sore throat and sneezing; and systemic symptoms, which included fatigue, headache and muscle aches. The researchers found that infections from Enterovirus, coronavirus (both of which can cause colds) and influenza virus were common among the participants. They also found that the different types of viruses infected men and women at about the same rates, Deiss said. [Flu Shot Facts & Side Effects (Updated for 2016-2017)] However, women were more likely than men to report moderate or severe earaches, headaches and reductions in appetite when they first went to the doctor, the researchers found. Women were also more likely than men to report severe symptoms of fatigue and muscle aches. But the researchers also found that men and women reported similar levels of symptom severity when they looked back at their first few days of being sick, Deiss said. It wasn't until the third day of being sick that men and women reported differences: From this point on, women were more likely than men to continue to report severe symptoms, he said. [7 Health Woes Brought on by Winter] Because the symptoms were self-reported, it's unclear if some people minimized their symptoms while others overemphasized them, Deiss noted. What the researchers can conclude from the study is that there seems to be a difference in how men and women report their symptoms, he said. In the future, the researchers hope to look at the biological differences in cold and flu symptoms in men versus in women, Deiss said. Hormonal differences may play a role in how the immune system responds to these viruses, he said."}

This has been the plot of seemingly countless examples of pulp magazines and canonical science fiction in the past century. Similar themes have been explored by authors like Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, and Arthur C. Clarke, classic television such as The Twilight Zone and Star Trek, and films like this month’s Arrival. But this particular story isn’t from the past century. Its explorer, Domingo Gonsales, is the fictional narrator of The Man in the Moone, a novel by Francis Godwin, a bishop in the Church of England. It was published in 1638. Science fiction is sometimes understood as the result of modern science. According to this view, the genre emerged to make sense of the tremendous expanses in empirical knowledge and technological ability throughout the 17th and 18th centuries—the Copernican model of the solar system, discoveries in the New World, medical advances, microscopes. Critics like Brian Aldiss have argued that Frankenstein, Mary Shelley’s 1818 masterpiece, is the first science-fiction novel because its fantastic events occur not because of magic or miracle, but purely through science. Yet many books written at the height of, or even before, the Scientific Revolution used the same narrative conceit. What makes these books fascinating is not just that they reflect the new science of the time, but that they demonstrate literature’s influence on scientific inquiry. Like many contemporary scientists say that Star Trek inspired their love of discovery, or that modern technology is prefigured by stories from a half-century ago, The Man in the Moone disseminated ideas like heliocentricism and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Science fiction alone did not inspire the scientific revolution, but the literature of the era did allow people to imagine different realities—in some cases, long before those realities actually became real. A reading list of these early stories includes works of varying canonicity, such as Thomas More’s Utopia (1516), Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis (1627), Johannes Kepler’s Somnium (1634), Margaret Cavendish’s The Blazing World (1666), Henry Neville’s The Isle of Pines (1688), and Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels (1726). These texts all share the driving curiosity that defines so much classic science fiction. There is no man this day living that can tell you of so many strange and unknown peoples and countries, writes More, describing the discoverer of the fictional island Utopia—a passage as evocative and stirring as to boldly go where no man has gone before. Though obscure today, Godwin’s The Man in the Moone captivated 17th-century readers with its tale of a Spaniard who travels in a ship powered by geese. He flies through space, which, for the first time in literature is depicted as weightless, then spends time with the denizens of a lunar civilization, only to leave for an almost equally exotic and technologically marvelous land called China. The story’s blend of natural philosophy, travel narrative, and the utopian and picaresque genres delighted English and European audiences. It also influenced literary stars for centuries. The French author Savinien de Cyrano de Bergerac poked fun at the book in his satirical 1657 novel, The Other World. Edgar Allen Poe referenced the novel in his 1835 story The Unparalleled Adventures of One Hans Pfaall. And H.G. Wells’ 1901 novel, The First Men in the Moon, was directly inspired by Godwin. Godwin’s influence was scientific as well. As the Oxford professor William Poole writes in his introduction to the latest edition of The Man in the Moone, Literary or humanistic traditions and practical astronomy were not absolutely separate activities for early-modern astronomers. For Godwin, the humanities and sciences weren’t just overlapping, they were often mutually reinforcing methodologies. John Wilkins, a fellow of the Royal Society and the inventor of the precursor to the metric system, argued in his book Mercury (1641) that Godwin’s novel could be used to unlock the secrets of natural philosophy. Even more provocative when it was first published was The Blazing World, by the first woman in the Royal Society, Margaret Cavendish. The story is an account of travels to a parallel universe accessed through the North Pole and populated by sentient animal-man creatures: Bear-men, some Worm-men, … some Bird-men, Some fly-men, some Ant-men, some Geese-men, and others. There are flying vehicles and submarines, as well as discussions on scientific innovations, particularly the most recent discoveries afforded by the invention of the microscope. The novel is especially notable for its narrative complexity. The author herself appears as a character and reflects on writing, making and dissolving several worlds in her own mind … a world of Ideas, a world of Atomes, a world of Lights. The authors’ acts of envisioning possible futures had a tangible impact on how reality took shape. The Blazing World was recovered as a subject of serious study by feminist critics in the last quarter of the 20th century, and Cavendish has recently found herself in more popular discussions as well. Danielle Dutton, whose historical novel Margaret the First kicked off a renewed interest in Cavendish earlier this year, says that the first time she encountered The Blazing World, she found it totally bizarre, in the best possible way: the talking animals, the cities of amber and coral, the metafictional move wherein the soul of Margaret Cavendish travels to the Blazing World to befriend the Empress. The book conjures the clockpunk era of primitive microscopes and telescopes, of fleas made monstrously visible to the human eye, and magnetic lodestones pointing true North. Godwin, Cavendish, and their contemporaries are important for generating a freely speculative space of imagination—which is still science fiction’s role today. In constructing worlds—or birthing paper bodies, as Cavendish called them—the authors’ acts of envisioning possible futures had a tangible impact on how reality took shape. Take this selection of technological marvels Bacon describes in New Atlantis: Versions of bodies into other bodies (organ transplants?), Exhilaration of the spirits, and putting them in good disposition (pharmaceuticals?), Drawing of new foods out of substances not now in use (genetically modified food?), Making new threads for apparel (synthetic fabrics?), Deceptions of the senses (television and film?). And then there’s this eerily prescient description of the Lunar technology in The Man in the Moone: You shal then see men to flie from place to place in the ayre; you shall be able, (without moving or travailing of any creature,) to send messages in an instant many Miles off, and receive answer againe immediately you shall bee able to declare your minde presently unto your friend, being in some private and remote place of a populous Citie, with a number of such like things… you shall have notices of a new World… that all the Philosophers of former ages could never so much as dreame of. Can one read that passage and not think of air travel, telecommunications, the internet, computers? This is prophesy, but not of scripture and myth; Godwin did not speak to angels, and had no scrying mirrors or tools of divination. Instead, he relied on empiricism and reason. And that gave him a rare quality as an oracle: He happened to be correct. What the scientific revolution did, writes the British historian Keith Thomas in Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in Popular Belief in Sixteenth and Seventeenth-Century England, was to … buttress up the old rationalist attitude with a more stable intellectual foundation. That is, science fiction wasn’t always derivative of scientific explanations themselves. Even before science had fully defined itself, literature offered a means for thinking about science. The capacity to envision alternative social arrangements, in particular, makes science fiction arguably the literary genre with the most revolutionary potential. Cavendish’s proto-feminist critique, Dutton says, was a critique of dominate power structures. In 17th-century Britain, these critiques … coming from a woman’s pen, no less, must have seemed nearly as fantastical as [her] talking bears! Science fiction has since been the social laboratory of visionaries like Ursula K. LeGuin, Samuel Delaney, Margaret Atwood, Philip K. Dick, and Octavia Butler. The freedom of speculative fiction has allowed these authors to question real-life culture in radical ways. In the tradition of socially engaged science fiction, Cavendish is the first Creatoress, as she called herself. In The Blazing World, Cavendish wrote that fictions are an issue of man’s Fancy, framed in his own Mind, according as he please, without regard, whether the thing, he fancies, be really existent without his mind of not. Yet for her, Godwin, Bacon, and others, so many of the things they fancied later did become really existent. Their imaginations didn’t always require empirical discoveries to have happened first; their fancies were written in the poetry of delight and wonder, before being confirmed in the prose of experiment and logic."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":548,"title":"This week in science: infinity beckons","class":1,"body":"New Horizons is now pushing the limit of what we’ve come to think of as the solar system. It’s in a strange, alien netherworld, on the edge of forever, not quite interstellar space, but far away from the familiar planets and moons we have come to know over the last half century. Soon it will coast into that final goodnight forever, the warmth provided by splitting atoms in its guts will slowly fade, and it will drift quietly into infinity. But the data already returned will help us learn more about Pluto for decades to come: Other research groups also have suggested that Pluto may harbor a subsurface ocean, using other lines of evidence. One such argument points to the dwarf planet's surface fractures, which may be the result of this ocean gradually freezing over time — a prospect also raised by Keane and his colleagues in their paper. As a technological witness to our ingenuity, New Horizons will last millions of years, probably longer. It will almost certainly outlast nations, it will probably outlast mountains and continents, and perhaps even the Earth and sun. But before that process begins in earnest, it has one more story to tell …. and we’ll talk about that with its principal investigator tomorrow, on Sunday Kos. How do we stop an asteroid or comet headed toward Earth? Getting to know you: getting to know all about you: Using a technique called mass spectrometry, the University of California San Diego research team tested 500 samples taken from 40 adults' mobile phones and hands. They then compared them to molecules identified in a database and produced a lifestyle profile of each phone owner. Photos of this week’s supermoon from around the world.

There, he told nervous negotiators that no one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the United States who know climate change is happening, and who are determined to keep our commitments that were made in Paris. Meanwhile, at the other pole: This is the second year in a row that temperatures near the North Pole have risen to freakishly warm levels. ...

{"id":549,"title":"Sorry to ruin your dreams, but that dog-petting polar bear just ate a husky alive","class":1,"body":"In case you missed it, the internet fell head over heels for this polar bear gently petting a husky in Churchill, Canada last week, because animals petting other animals is kind of the best. But if something in nature seems too good to be true, it probably is, because life in the wild is brutal, relentless, and about as cute as a blood-soaked penguin trying to steal your lady. Case in point: just hours after this footage was released, that very same polar bear ate another dog alive. That was the only day we didn't feed the f--king bears, the only night we didn't put anything out, Churchill resident Brian Ladoon told Bryce Hoye at CBC News. Ladoon, who runs the Mile 5 Dog Sanctuary in Churchill, regularly feeds the polar bears in the area to try and dissuade them from picking off his dogs for their meal. But the very same day that the footage of the polar bear petting one of the chained-up dogs was released, another dog was eaten, and the consequences are going to be extremely dire for polar bears in the area. Conservation officers had to immobilise a bear in that area last week and move it to the holding facility because it killed one of his dogs, a Manitoba Sustainable Development spokesperson told CBC News. A mother and cub were also removed because there were allegations the bears were being fed and the females' behaviour was becoming a concern. As you might have guessed, deliberately feeding wild polar bears is highly illegal, as the Manitoba Endangered Species and Ecosystem Act states, No person shall kill, injure, possess, disturb, or interfere with an endangered species, a threatened species, or an extirpated species that has been reintroduced. At this stage, it’s not clear if Ladoon will be fined for the practice, but the polar bears will likely suffer, because if they’ve grown accustomed to being fed, they could become extremely dangerous now that officials have stepped in to put a stop to it. It's basically a death sentence for the bears, Ian Stirling, an expert on Arctic and Antarctic ecology from the University of Alberta, told CBC News. As it turns out, Ladoon is a highly controversial figure within his community, and admits to feeding the bears for decades to try and protect his dogs. For almost half a century, Ladoon has been at the forefront of conservation efforts to save the endangered Canadian Eskimo Dog, and says illegally feeding the polar bears is the only way to ensure their safety. I was tired of the bloodbath, he told Kelsey Eliasson at Up Here. Before the dogs found a home at Mile 5, Ladoon was breeding the dogs in a cottage near Churchill, but the polar bears started swarming the property, and he says local officials ignored his pleas for help. Ladoon asked the government if he could take over a parcel of Crown land beside Hudson Bay, Eliasson reports. He got no response. So the next bear he shot, he cut off its head and mailed it to the natural resources office in Winnipeg. As a result, Ladoon was granted access to Mile 5. While Ladoon's conservation work with the dogs is surely valuable, people have taken issue with the fact that he ties his dogs up - something that's led to the deaths of several dogs over the years, including the one last week. The dog was chained up and they're totally vulnerable, Stirling told CBC News. Inuit [hunters] over the years in the high Arctic have told me that if you want a dog to act as a guard dog, you have to leave it off a chain. Because if it's on a chain it knows it's vulnerable and it won't bark. For our part, we need to stop anthropomorphising wild animals, because what was hailed as some strangely chill behaviour from the polar bear was more likely it playing with its food. And not being able to tell the difference between the two could be seriously dangerous, not just for dogs, but for people living in the vicinity of these apex predators, whose numbers are now dwindling before our eyes. We see them through the heavy filter of our own feelings, our own needs, Robert Krulwich writes over at NPR. Animals who'd once been proud and vicious had become 'delicate, drowning' victims, lonely animals - who now just might need the companionship of a friendly husky - who might come to a backyard, looking for a hug."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":550,"title":"Training the next generation in science and technology","class":1,"body":"WHEN GLADY BAEZ came to her Vertex Pharmaceuticals internship as a high school junior, she was uncertain of her future. While she was interested in science and business, she didn’t know the range of career options possible. During Glady’s paid internship at Vertex, she and her class of 30 high school interns worked alongside scientists steeped in research on cystic fibrosis and other diseases. The experience sparked her imagination in science and propelled her down a track that, three years later, has her feet firmly planted as a biology major at UMass Boston. She is the first in her family to go to college. Glady’s internship at one of the nation’s most dynamic biotech companies opened doors too often closed to high school students, especially females and students of color. The dearth of similar opportunities not only prevents promising young people from excelling in deeply rewarding careers, it stymies our economic growth. Keeping Massachusetts competitive requires a workforce that excels in science, technology, engineering, and math, or STEM. More than 40 percent of the Commonwealth’s economy centers on jobs in STEM fields, including advanced manufacturing, information technology, and biotech. Massachusetts has more open positions in these fields than employees to fill them, a void that threatens our economic drivers. Industry analysts and CEOs repeatedly identify this gap as the single greatest challenge facing the Commonwealth’s STEM economy. Massachusetts isn’t alone. Across the country, states with strong technology, biotech, medical, and engineering economies struggle to provide employers with educated, work-ready employees. And STEM readiness has global implications: There is an international race to create a highly skilled workforce capable of driving an increasingly innovation-centered world. That is why it’s so important that students like Glady have opportunities to learn about STEM careers. And that is why we’re making a simple but powerful ask of Massachusetts businesses: Hire at least one high school student for a STEM internship. Despite the large number of jobs available, just one in six high school seniors are interested in STEM, and the United States ranks 27th among developed nations in undergraduate degrees in science or engineering. Internships — during the school year, after school, or in the summer — are an incredibly valuable way to provide young people with hands-on, real-world work experience. And they offer value for employers interested in developing future leaders in their fields. More than 250 STEM businesses from every region host close to 1,000 high school interns each year. These students are thriving at the Commonwealth’s hospitals and biotech, finance, and IT companies, and in advanced manufacturing — learning on-the-job skills and contributing to their host companies. At the same time, companies with a STEM intern program are beginning to nurture a strong pool of skilled and engaged homegrown talent — one that can fill critical job openings. STEM internships are also a meaningful way for companies to engage high schools and mentor students on-site in their workplaces. The state’s School to Career Connecting Activities program supports businesses of all sizes that want to host high school interns. Through Connecting Activities – which includes the Boston Private Industry Council that helped connect Glady to Vertex – dedicated staff in all 16 workforce regions of the state identify students and work with companies and high schools to provide assistance and guidance throughout the internship process. The system is working, and Massachusetts companies are stepping up to the plate — in addition to Vertex, hundreds of other businesses have internship opportunities for high school students. But only a handful of companies provide internships in STEM-related fields. To remain competitive, we can and should do more. Our economic success depends on providing the innovation economy with smart workers and providing young people like Glady Baez with the experience to land high-paying, satisfying jobs. We are calling on business leaders — particularly those in STEM fields — to consider taking one or more high school interns for summer 2017. Internships are critical to get students involved early, and spark passion and drive amongst our youth to pursue STEM careers. And we can’t afford to wait to get them started. Karyn Polito is the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. Joe Kennedy III is the US Representative for Massachusetts’ Fourth Congressional District. Dr. Jeffrey Leiden is the chairman, president, and CEO of Vertex."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":551,"title":"Lying sets up a liar’s brain to lie more","class":1,"body":"Activity in a brain region called the amygdala may explain how small lies escalate When small fibs snowball into blizzards of deception, the brain becomes numb to lying. As people tell more and bigger untruths, certain brain areas respond less to the whoppers, scientists now show. Their data finding might help explain how small fibs can ultimately set pants afire. The findings have big implications for how lying can develop, says Victoria Talwar. She is a developmental psychologist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. She studies how dishonest behavior develops in children. This research, she says, starts to give us some idea about how lying escalates from small lies to bigger ones. Neil Garrett is a neuroscientist in England at University College London. He and colleagues there and at Duke University in Durham, N.C., performed an experiment. Their teams showed 80 participants a crisp, big picture of a glass jar of pennies. The participants were told to estimate how much money was in the jar. Then they had to share that estimate with an unseen partner. That partner, they were told, saw a smaller picture of the same jar. That meant the partner would have to rely on the participant to get a good estimate. Each participant was serving as a well-informed financial adviser tasked with advising a client who is less informed about what investments to make, Garrett noted. He offered the explanation at an October 20 news briefing. Explainer: How to read brain activity The participants didn’t have to tell their partners the truth. And the researchers gave people varying incentives to lie. In some cases, for instance, overestimating how much money was in the jar resulted in the participant getting a bigger cut of the money. That gave the estimators an incentive to stretch the truth. As the experiment wore on, the fibs started flying. People lied the most when the lie would benefit both themselves and their unseen partner. But these financial advisers also told self-serving lies even when it would hurt their partner. Twenty-five participants also underwent scans of their brains while they told lies. The researchers used a technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It estimates brain activity based on changing rates of blood flow in different parts of the brain as some task is performed. When someone had lied before, brain activity lessened in certain areas of the brain. This was most notable in the amygdala (Ah-MIG-duh-lah). A pair of these almond-shaped brain structures sit deep within each person’s brain. These areas are tightly linked to emotions. Scientists Say: MRI A drop in the amygdala’s activity even seemed to predict whether someone would lie on the next trial. The findings suggest that the reduced brain activity actually influences the decision to lie. Garrett’s group described its findings online October 24 in Nature Neuroscience. The study design gets around a problem that can compromise other lying experiments, says Bernd Weber. He is a neuroscientist at the University of Bonn in Germany. Many experiments are based on lies that people have been instructed to say, he notes. That situation, he notes, hardly resembles real-world behavior. In the new study, the participants were self-motivated. They chose to play loose with the truth. But there weren’t any real costs to a liar for a fib. The participants did not have to fear being caught. If they had been afraid, that might have altered activity in their amygdalas, Weber says. Further tests are needed to hunt for any effects of such fear. There are plenty of examples from the worlds of finance and politics in which small lies spiraled into much bigger deceits, Tali Sharot noted in the news briefing. This neuroscientist at UCL was a coauthor of the new study. There are many reasons why this might happen, societal reasons, she said. But we suspected that there might be a basic biological principle of how our brain works that contributes to this phenomenon. The principle she had in mind is called emotional adaptation. This is the same phenomenon that explains why the scent of strong perfume becomes less noticeable over time. The first time people cheat on their taxes, they probably feel quite bad about it, Sharot says. That remorse is good, she says. It curbs dishonesty. The next time you cheat, you have already adapted, she explains. Now there’s less of an emotional doubt to hold you back, so you might be lying more. In other words, the more someone lies, the easier it may get."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":552,"title":"How data science and rocket science will get humans to Mars","class":1,"body":"In a recent op-ed to CNN, President Obama re-affirmed America’s commitment to sending a manned mission to Mars. Think your data science challenges are too complicated? Imagine the difficulties involved in mining data to understand the health impacts of an expedition to Mars. What happens to astronauts’ muscle tone or lung capacities after several years in space? How much weight can they safely lose? How much CO2 should be in the crew vehicle? How many sensors are needed to calculate joint flexibility in each individual space suit? When sending humans where no one has gone before, there are a multitude of variables to consider, and NASA is hard at work researching the health and safety risks of a future Mission to Mars. Understanding these risks is critical, as they impact a number of decisions that need to be made when planning the journey — spanning everything from how potential crew members are evaluated to equipment engineering, mission logistics and the determination of needed fuel loads. The stakes are high, but NASA realized from the get-go that it needed to focus less on developing the perfect analytic model and more on building a data science process that empowers decision-makers to use analytics to answer a multitude of continually changing questions. But you don’t have to be dealing with rocket science to learn from NASA’s analytic approach. Here are several key takeaways from NASA’s project that are useful for any organization about to embark — or that’s stuck — on a big data analytics initiative. Stop making it so complicated Simply put, data science shouldn’t be as complicated as rocket science. (See what I did there?) Yes, analyzing big data has challenges, and yes, your approach may vary depending on what kinds of insights you hope to obtain, but there’s no need to make things more complex than the situation calls for. All too often, organizations end up spending endless cycles attempting to move data in order to analyze it when they should instead be focusing on bringing the analytics to the data. Big data, by definition, is very tough, if not impossible, to move around. This is why distributed storage and processing frameworks like Hadoop exist — data in the cloud is far more scalable than data in a silo. For the Mars project, there are so many levels of data to look at, ranging from health data collected from astronauts like Scott Kelly who have completed previous space missions, to non-astronaut test studies, to studies done in simulated space environments like the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Getting all the data in one place is the critical first step. For this reason, NASA is using the Collaborative Advanced Analytics and Data Sharing platform developed by Lockheed Martin and several analytic partners, such as Alpine Data, to analyze data at its source. Because there’s no waiting to download data into a separate analytic environment to work with it, researchers can focus their time and energy on asking questions and getting the answers that will help them plan a mission to Mars. The launch is just the beginning A successful rocket launch is only step one in a multi-year expedition to Mars. Based on past experiences, NASA expects to encounter and address numerous challenges along the way. The same holds true for data analytics projects. Simply deploying a model doesn’t mean the project is done. In fact, the most valuable analytics initiatives are those where models are continually refined and iterated on an ongoing basis. Data science shouldn’t be as complicated as rocket science. Like the scientific method, getting the most out of analytics requires experimentation, testing, learning from failures and testing again. NASA wants to be able to quickly query the large volumes of data at its disposal, then funnel insights back into new models capable of building on what came before. That’s why the data science process for this initiative resembles a pendulum, where the forward swing focuses on rapidly driving insights out to researchers and the backward swing focuses on measuring, evaluating results, refining the model and then swinging again. Work with the data you have, not the data you wish you had An ability to quickly and easily refine analytic models is especially valuable when your data sets aren’t perfect. (And really, is any data set perfect?) For NASA, the biggest data challenge is that the astronaut sample size is small — only 300 individuals have been accepted to NASA’s Astronaut Corps. Researchers have to mine the heck out of the data collected from this small sample and extrapolate. For example, based on how a 35-year-old female with a starting weight of 120 pounds responded to a five-month trip in space, how would a 32-year-old weighing 123 respond to two years? What about a 30-year-old weighing 118? Furthermore, since an astronaut has yet to step foot on the Red Planet, there’s no data about the health impacts of actually living on Mars (Matt Damon doesn’t count). But what can NASA learn from astronauts who have gone to the Moon, or spent a year in the International Space Station? What happens when data from test subjects living in simulated space environments is plugged into a predictive model? With analytic tools that support rapid model deployment and refinement, organizations can keep trying different ways to extract insight from the data they do have to make better predictions, even when key information is missing. Break the metaphorical black box With the Mars Mission, NASA is not only putting billions of invested taxpayer dollars on the line, but also the lives of its astronauts, who risk their health and safety in the name of science and exploration. Like any consumer of analytics, NASA needs to be able to trust in the recommendations that are being generated, but this is hard to do if predictions are computed in a black box that only data science experts can manipulate or understand. For a project like this, empowering analytic consumers who aren’t necessarily data science PhDs (such as the health researchers, equipment engineers and others planning the mission) to actually build and launch queries and use the data on their own is key. This requires tight collaboration between business and IT stakeholders, modeling tools that are simple to use and modify and the ability to push insights to the people who need them. This is why NASA has chosen a collaborative analytic platform that includes tools that extend outputs directly into the systems and applications that are used by the scientists and decision-makers working on the Mars Mission. Large and complex data sets pose challenges for any organization about to embark on an analytics deployment. But NASA’s example of harnessing data to plan the most complicated of journeys — an expedition to Mars — proves that the challenges are not insurmountable. With the right tools and, most importantly, a consistent and well-planned approach, data science doesn’t have to be as daunting as rocket science."}

The professor has claimed that the study has actually showed that there are strange yet amazing things that he has found as to to how the mind works, how the human brain works, people's human socialization just by looking at profanity. Cursing: How Was The Study Conducted? In one of his statements revealed by CBS News, study lead author, Benjamin Bergen,who is also the author of the book What the F: What Swearing Reveals About Our Language, Our Brains, and Ourselves, has claimed that the study has suggested that on average, the ones who swear the most also have the biggest vocabulary overall. It was found that as the professor dug deeper into the impacts of the usage of foul language, a certain Wesley Chan was made as a test subject. Bergen has allegedly asked Chan to write about his opinion on abortion as researchers purposefully attacked his point of view to get him riled up. Furthermore, in the study, it was also noted that the test subject has also been instructed. Meanwhile, Daily News has also reported that the study's findings showed that cursing makes people no less aggressive. Additionally, it was also found that Bergen has noted that the most commonly used curse word is the F bomb. Bergen said that men are found to be more suitable in using swear words in different circumstances as compared to women, although he said he's been told that in private, women curse just as often. Ultimately, Bergen has been reportedly to have claimed that cursing are just mere words. He highly emphasized that it would really boil down to how it is being used, that you put them to that can be harmful or not."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":554,"title":"How turning off a plant's sunshield can grow bigger crops","class":1,"body":"Just because plants photosynthesize doesn't mean they can't get a form of sunburn—damage caused by overexposure to light. That's why all plants rely on a mechanism that defends against excessively bright sunlight by converting photons into harmless heat. But like someone who is slow to doff their sunglasses indoors, this botanical sun shield is slow to turn off when a shadow passes over a leaf. The result: Photosynthesis stays depressed. Now, plant biologists seeking improved photosynthesis—and, ultimately, more bountiful crops—have cleverly manipulated plants to adjust more quickly to shade. Genetically engineered into tobacco plants, the faster response yielded up to a 20% increase in biomass. The proof-of-concept study, which appears today in Science, is ground-breaking and the first convincing field trial in the hot area of engineering photosynthesis, says Robert Furbank, an integrative plant biologist at the Australian National University in Canberra. Traditional plant breeding has greatly boosted yields of popular crops. During the green revolution, for example, Norman Borlaug and others nearly doubled wheat yields by creating plants with short, sturdy stems that could hold a greater load of grain. Nowadays, breeders can get crops to put about 50% to 60% of their biomass into seeds. But the gains have stagnated at less than 1% per year because plant growth is now limited by the efficiency of photosynthesis itself. Research teams are trying to break the bottleneck in multiple ways. One long-held dream is taking a high-power type of photosynthesis found in corn and three other crops, called the C4 pathway, and putting it into rice. Another goal is improving RuBisCO, the notoriously sluggish enzyme that catalyzes early stages in the conversion of carbon dioxide into useful organic molecules. More recently, a few researchers have contemplated streamlining an aspect of photosynthesis called photoprotection. To guard themselves from bright light—as well as balance their metabolic processes—plants rely on a mechanism called nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), in which chloroplasts divert photons from their light-harvesting molecules and simply waste them as heat. In dim conditions, plants can turn off NPQ to boost photosynthetic efficiency. But although they can raise the shield in a few minutes, lowering the defenses can take hours, which limits photosynthesis in the shade. This time lag isn't a problem for wild plants, for which survival and reproduction are paramount, but it's a disadvantage for farmers who want to maximize biomass. In 2004, plant physiologist Stephen Long of the University of Illinois in Urbana and colleagues calculated that NPQ operating under typical conditions for a midlatitude farm can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide turned into sugars by up to 30%. After reading Long's paper, geneticist Krishna Niyogi of the University of California, Berkeley, had an idea for how to turn off NPQ faster. The strategy was to add extra copies of three genes whose proteins are responsible for relaxing the protection. The higher protein levels should speed the response to shade. Niyogi, Long, and their postdocs took these genes from the widely studied mustard Arabidopsis thaliana and inserted them into tobacco plants, which are relatively easy to modify. After lab and greenhouse testing, they planted them in a test field near the University of Illinois. The modified tobacco bulked up their leaves, stems, and roots, weighing 14% to 20% more than unmodified plants after 22 days. To see something like that increase in a field trial was astonishing, Niyogi says. The bonus came without apparent side effects, although the researchers could not test for any loss of disease resistance or stress tolerance in such a small field trial. The big question is whether similar manipulations in food crops will mean more consumable yield. To find out, Niyogi and Long have already started to put the genes into elite breeding lines of rice and maize, and other crops could follow. Long also predicts that researchers will find ways to turn off NPQ even faster, and perhaps generate even more biomass. We think this could still be bigger than we have now. It's also possible that the same effect could be achieved without moving genes between species, which might ease regulatory approval or improve consumer acceptance. Plants normally silence any extra copies of their own genes, but editing the genes or promoters using CRISPR or another technique could get around that barrier, allowing researchers to work with a species's own genetic material. Regardless of how it's done, boosting photosynthesis could help researchers answer critics of plant biotechnology who complain that genetically modified plants have not boosted harvests, says Dario Leister, a plant molecular biologist at Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich in Germany. Making plants that yield more: That is something that everyone should be happy about."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":555,"title":"UK politicians demand Brexit guarantee for EU scientists","class":1,"body":"The UK government should immediately guarantee that all European Union researchers living in the country can stay after it leaves the EU, an influential group of politicians has said. The recommendation comes in a report on the impacts of Brexit on science, released on 18 November by the House of Commons science and technology select committee. The report also urges the government to set out a broader vision for science — including committing to a hefty raise in UK science spending. Uncertainty over Brexit threatens to undermine some of the UK’s ongoing international scientific collaborations. Telling EU scientists and researchers already working in the UK that they are allowed to stay is one way the Government could reduce that uncertainty right away, said Stephen Metcalfe, the chair of the committee and Conservative MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock, in a statement. Ever since June’s Brexit referendum, scientists have fretted about the uncertainty caused for non-British EU nationals, who have been left unsure what their employment rights may be in a few years’ time. There are around 31,000 such researchers in the United Kingdom, according to a Royal Society estimate, and they make up about 15% of UK universities' academic staff. The committee’s inquiry heard from many researchers who were seriously considering leaving the country, and the report concludes that reassurances are needed to avoid a brain drain. A group at University College London’s Institute of Neurology told the committee that it had polled 67 postdocs, of whom 18% were actively seeking jobs outside the United Kingdom because of Brexit. Some immediate reassurance would be in the interest of the science base and the country, says Graeme Reid, a science-policy researcher at University College London. Vision for science The committee — whose members come from all sides of the political divide — also worries that the government isn’t paying enough attention to science as it prepares to leave the EU. We are not convinced that the needs of science and research are at the heart of the Department for Exiting the European Union’s (DExEU) thinking and planning for Brexit, the report says. For example, whereas most UK government departments have a chief science adviser (CSA), DExEU — dubbed the Brexit ministry — doesn’t. In a confused episode during the inquiry, science minister Jo Johnson and junior Brexit minister Robin Walker told the committee that they were advertising to fill the role, but later withdrew their statement. Now, says the report, DExEU should recruit someone as a matter of urgency. The committee adds that the government should commit to raising public and private spending on research to 3% of UK gross domestic product. It stood at 1.7% in 2014, below the EU’s 2% average. The report notes that the 3% figure has been suggested many times before, by the committee itself and by science lobby groups. And earlier this week it got another airing, when the four UK national academies — the Academy of Medical Sciences, the British Academy, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society — also called on the government to set a 3% target. Action points Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute in Oxford, says it is good that the report contains sensible, practical suggestions for science advice and job security, rather than vague requests. Having a CSA is a clear, practical recommendation that is easily fixed, he says. Researchers are now waiting anxiously for 23 November, when Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the exchequer, may signal the government’s intentions for science in the annual Autumn Statement on government spending. That’s quite an important date for the science and research community, says Hillman. I wouldn’t place all my bets on an Autumn Statement announcement, says Reid. But he thinks that the government does recognize that science has an important role in the United Kingdom’s future. Another political controversy was partially addressed earlier this week, when the government announced a series of amendments to controversial plans to reform the governance of higher education. The plans aim to bring together several funding bodies — including the seven research councils — into a central funder called United Kingdom Research and Innovation, and to overhaul university governance. But some researchers fear that it might remove universities’ autonomy, including their ability to choose what to teach and when. Johnson says the changes include measures to ensure the autonomy and financial sustainability of universities — including not allowing the government to tell institutions that they must stop or start particular courses."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":556,"title":"Experiment to raise the dead blocked in India","class":1,"body":"BENGALURU, INDIA—The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has derailed a controversial experiment that would seek to revive brain-dead accident victims. On 11 November, ICMR’s National Institute of Medical Statistics removed the ReAnima trial from India’s clinical trial registry. In May, Himanshu Bansal, an orthopedic surgeon at Anupam Hospital in the north Indian state of Uttarakhand, announced plans to give around 20 brain-dead people a mix of interventions including injections of mesenchymal stem cells and peptides, and transcranial laser stimulation and median nerve stimulation. Transcranial laser stimulation involves shining pulses of near-infrared light into the brain; median nerve stimulation is the electrical stimulation of a major nerve that runs from the neck to the arm. Both techniques have been shown to improve cognition in patients with traumatic brain injury. Bioquark, a biotech firm based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, had agreed to supply the trial with peptides that are said to help regenerate brain cells. In interviews with Indian media in the spring, Bansal described his aim as bringing brain-dead individuals back to a minimally conscious state in which patients show flickers of consciousness, such as moving their eyes to track objects. Although there is scant evidence that brain-dead people can recover such function, Bansal says the medical literature describes a significant number of cases of people who have recovered full consciousness from a minimally conscious state. Other researchers point out that it is improbable that the ReAnima trial—which hasn’t yet begun—would achieve its goals. While there have been numerous demonstrations in recent years that the human brain and nervous system may not be as fixed and irreparable as is typically assumed, the idea that brain death could be easily reversed seems very far-fetched, Dean Burnett, a neuroscientist at the United Kingdom’s Cardiff University, told The Telegraph.  Medical journals have on occasion carried reports of brain-dead individuals on life support returning to a fully functional state, but researchers have argued that such cases are hard to interpret and often lack evidence of brain death such as the apnea test, a measure of whether the person’s brain stem is making an effort to breathe. Scientists and physicians are also raising concerns about whether the ReAnima trial is ethically justified. One concern is that the mix of interventions has not been tested in animal models. On their own, the treatments the ReAnima trial would use have shown promise in people with traumatic brain injury, says Amar Jesani, editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics in Mumbai. But once brain stem death has taken place, and there is no cognition or consciousness, one cannot rely on a few disconnected studies. Why couldn’t they combine these interventions and do proper animal studies? And even if the experiment were to succeed, he asserts, bringing a brain-dead person back to a minimally conscious state would traumatize family members. In a press statement, Bansal argued that there are no good animal models for human brain death. Asked in a June interview for The Wire what he planned to do if patients were brought back to a minimally conscious state but did not regain further function, Bansal responded that his team had not planned for it initially, but that he had since purchased an insurance policy to cover the costs of full-time care of such patients. Still, the ReAnima team has struggled to convince family members to allow brain-dead accident victims to be enrolled in the trial, says Ira Pastor, chief executive officer of Bioquark. ICMR identified several regulatory lapses in the trial, including a failure to seek permission to proceed from the Drug Controller General of India, a requirement for all clinical trials in India. Now that ICMR has deregistered ReAnima, the Drug Controller General of India G. N. Singh must stop the trial immediately, says ICMR Deputy Director General Geeta Jotwani in New Delhi. Bansal told Science that ICMR has nothing to do with the trial, and says the matter rests with the drug controller. Singh’s office did not respond to questions from Science. Bioquark’s Pastor says that the setback ultimately won’t stop the project, and if necessary the team would pursue the trial outside India. We are in no major rush, in that it represents a ‘Google Moonshot’–style project, he says. Many road blocks, no doubt, will pop up. But the project will go on."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":557,"title":"Brazil’s scientists battle to escape 20-year funding freeze","class":1,"body":"Brazil’s science budget has shrunk by more than 40% in the past three years. But researchers are now trying to escape an even worse crisis: federal science spending could be frozen at its current low level for the next two decades, under a constitutional amendment to cap public spending to only inflation-level rises. On 16 November, 19 institutions representing higher education and research sent a letter to Brazil’s Senate asking that politicians exclude science and education from the amendment, which is President Michel Temer’s top legislative priority as he aims to halt the country’s spiraling fiscal crisis. The amendment passed the lower house of Brazil’s National Congress last month; the Senate is due to vote on it by the end of this month. If Temer’s legislation does end up constricting federal science spending, it will be the end of science in Brazil, warns physicist Luiz Davidovich, who is president of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences in Rio de Janeiro, which co-authored the letter. Last month, scientists had joined protests in Rio and other cities against the amendment, which they called the #PECdoFimDoMundo (amendment of the end of the world). Science in crisis Brazil’s public spending does need to be reined in, says Carlos Américo Pacheco, chief executive of the São Paulo Research Foundation, a state science-funding agency. It’s a bitter medicine, but it’s inevitable: you won’t be able to fix public finance without a major effort to cut expenses, he says. But scientists say that they’ve had enough pain. In 2013, the science ministry budget stood at 7.9 billion reais (US$2.3 billion). After the economy slumped, it has now fallen to 4.6 billion reais — the lowest level in seven years (see ‘Funding nosedive’), and the lowest in a decade when inflation is accounted for. And that includes the budget of the communications ministry, which Temer merged with the science ministry to create the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications (MCTIC) when he took office in May. As a result of the cuts, some Brazilian scientists have left the country; others are making do on less funding. And officials at major planned facilities such as the 850-million-reais Multipurpose Research Reactor outside São Paulo — which aims to generate medical radioisotopes — and the 510-million-reais Sirius synchrotron, in Campinas, have complained that they haven’t yet received their 2016 funds. Freezing the science budget at these low levels could be disastrous, says Helena Nader, president of the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science. Federal science spending is currently around 1.1% of Brazil’s gross domestic product (GDP), but that figure would fall if spending is frozen and GDP grows over the coming years. Nader compares that with science spending in China, which is planned to grow from 2.1% of GDP now to 2.5% in 2020. The MCTIC says that the amendment will not necessarily affect the science budget. Science might even get more money — provided that other areas of federal funding get less. But critics say that’s unlikely in a country with other pressing needs, including chronically underfunded public education and health and a collapsing pensions system. Next year’s budget MCTIC minister Gilberto Kassab is trying to increase the science budget ahead of the amendment. His 2017 request, included in a government proposal that has not yet been voted on by Brazil’s congress, would increase the budget by 28% to 5.9 billion reais. The MCTIC has managed to include in the annual budget a value that’s enough to meet the needs of the sector, a spokesperson told Nature. Davidovich disagrees. He says that, after accounting for inflation, research needs at least 10 billion reais to match the federal science spending levels of three years ago — so it is well under par. To scientists’ further dismay, the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development — a federal funding agency — has been further demoted within the new structure of the MCTIC. The council used to be an independent body whose president would report directly to the science minister; now it and other institutions such as the Brazilian Space Agency will report to a director who in turn will report to a vice-minister for science. We [science] have been shoved to the fourth level, says Nader. The political downgrading will make it harder for the council to fight for resources, say Nader and Davidovich. Last month, the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science and the Brazilian Academy of Sciences delivered a joint letter to Kassab protesting against the move. The minister said that he’d review the changes in January. For now, Brazilian science faces a cloud of uncertainty. As researchers have asked, the amendment could be altered to spare sensitive areas such as education and research. Senators might also try to spare a specific slice of the MCTIC budget that comes from the revenue of some businesses (such as oil and telecommunications), Davidovich thinks. It is hard to predict how the amendment might unfold in the Senate, he says. But then again, someone has said that, in Brazil, even the past is unpredictable."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":558,"title":"Argentina president's first budget angers scientists","class":1,"body":"Researchers in Argentina are incensed about budget cuts that look set to hit the nation’s science ministry especially hard next year — even though President Mauricio Macri pledged to boost science spending when he took office last December. Science in Argentina faces a critical situation, says Dora Barrancos, a gender-issues researcher at the National University of Quilmes in Buenos Aires. She fears that the cuts, after years of budget increases, may presage a return to the troubles of the twentieth century, when scientists fled the country in their thousands. If young scientists do not have opportunities here, the brain drain is going to restart. In September this year, Macri’s government proposed to cut overall science spending to around 32 billion pesos (US$2 billion) in 2017, a fall of around 6% in real terms, according to government estimates of domestic inflation. As part of that proposal, the science ministry would have seen a cut of more than 50% in real terms. In October, scientists poured out onto the streets in protest. A revamped budget, passed by Argentina’s lower house of parliament on 3 November, has added around 1.3 billion pesos to overall science spending, limiting the damage to around 2%. Still, the science ministry will take a real-terms cut of 36% — and researchers remain unhappy. Argentina’s Senate is due to vote on the budget by the end of November. Particularly galling is that Macri had promised dramatic increases to the country’s research spending in his campaign. He proposed raising the share of the economy dedicated to science and technology from around 0.6% of gross domestic product in 2014 to 1.5% by 2019. Instead, he has prioritized paying off Argentina’s debt, notes Jorge Aliaga, a physicist at the University of Buenos Aires. Aliaga also points out that the government's overall budget is rising in real terms. Taking that into account, he argues that the science budget is 8.5% down on where it would be if it had kept pace with overall spending. Street protests Aliaga is part of Science and Technology Argentina (CyTA), a group of concerned scientists who in October coordinated a petition against Macri’s first budget. More than 33,000 researchers and university teachers signed it, and CyTA and university-student associations organized protests in 9 cities, including outside the parliament in Buenos Aires. The noise got parliament’s attention, and helped prompt the revised budget. But the damage-limitation hasn’t been enough, researchers say. The National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), a research institute that employs some 9,600 research staff, now gets a 6% real-terms raise to around 10 billion pesos ($660 million). Most of the institute's cash is swallowed up in paying salaries for researchers. It planned to increase its research staff by 10% annually until 2019 — and had hired 920 young researchers this year — but will only be able to pay 400 new staff in 2017. As a result, young scientists will go abroad, and the setback will be very difficult to revert, says Andrea Gamarnik, a virologist at the Leloir Institute Foundation in Buenos Aires. Lorena Coria, a 33-year-old biologist on a CONICET postdoc fellowship to develop oral vaccines for children, is one researcher who applied to be hired by the institute this year — but as a result of the constrained budget, now does not know if she will be taken on. I know there are good opportunities abroad, she says. The science ministry takes the worst hit. In particular, its National Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology, which funds both basic and applied research, had been set for a 60% real-terms budget drop in September’s version of the budget. With November’s parliamentary adjustment, and by borrowing money from credit organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank, the agency may yet recover some of its lost spending power, says science minister Lino Barañao. Barañao also insists that there will be no brain drain. He prefers to take the long view, noting that science and technology funding has steadily increased since 2007. And parliamentary budgets do not set funding in stone: this year’s spending on science, for example, looks set to be around 4% higher than the 2016 settlement that was agreed by parliament. The same could happen in 2017, he says."}

Toss some herbs in a pan, put it in the oven, out comes the bird. But that bird often comes out desiccated and bland, a totem to the Thanksgiving traditions that have long gone stale. That, at least, had been my experience. But last year, something changed: I found J. Kenji López-Alt’s cookbook, The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science, and it transformed the way I made turkey on Thanksgiving Day. López-Alt suggests removing the turkey’s backbone and splaying its legs (what’s called spatchcocking). In this position, the bird cooks more evenly because it lies flatter, which allows the heat to reach every part more efficiently. The spatchcocked turkey I made was delectable. On this episode of Sparks, FiveThirtyEight’s monthly science podcast that runs in the What’s The Point feed, we discuss The Food Lab and the role that science plays in the kitchen.

{"id":560,"title":"With an Eye on Hunger, Scientists See Promise in Genetic Tinkering of Plants","class":1,"body":"URBANA, Ill. — A decade ago, agricultural scientists at the University of Illinois suggested a bold approach to improve the food supply: tinker with photosynthesis, the chemical reaction powering nearly all life on Earth. The idea was greeted skeptically in scientific circles and ignored by funding agencies. But one outfit with deep pockets, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, eventually paid attention, hoping the research might help alleviate global poverty. Now, after several years of work funded by the foundation, the scientists are reporting a remarkable result. Using genetic engineering techniques to alter photosynthesis, they increased the productivity of a test plant — tobacco — by as much as 20 percent, they said Thursday in a study published by the journal Science. That is a huge number, given that plant breeders struggle to eke out gains of 1 or 2 percent with more conventional approaches. The scientists have no interest in increasing the production of tobacco; their plan is to try the same alterations in food crops, and one of the leaders of the work believes production gains of 50 percent or more may ultimately be achievable. If that prediction is borne out in further research — it could take a decade, if not longer, to know for sure — the result might be nothing less than a transformation of global agriculture. The findings could also intensify the political struggle over genetic engineering of the food supply. Some groups oppose it, arguing that researchers are playing God by moving genes from one species to another. That argument has gained some traction with the public, in part because the benefits of gene-altered crops have so far been modest at best. But gains of 40 or 50 percent in food production would be an entirely different matter, potentially offering enormous benefits for the world’s poorest people, many of them farmers working small plots of land in the developing world. We’re here because we want to alleviate poverty, said Katherine Kahn, the officer at the Gates Foundation overseeing the grant for the Illinois research. What is it the farmers need, and how can we help them get there? One of the leaders of the research, Stephen P. Long, a crop scientist who holds appointments at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at Lancaster University in England, emphasized in an interview that a long road lay ahead before any results from the work might reach farmers’ fields. But Dr. Long is also convinced that genetic engineering could ultimately lead to what he called a second Green Revolution that would produce huge gains in food production, like the original Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, which transferred advanced agricultural techniques to some developing countries and led to reductions in world hunger. The research involves photosynthesis, in which plants use carbon dioxide from the air and energy from sunlight to form new, energy-rich carbohydrates. These compounds are, in turn, the basic energy supply for almost all animal cells, including those of humans. The mathematical description of photosynthesis is sometimes billed as the equation that powers the world. For a decade, Dr. Long had argued that photosynthesis was not actually very efficient. In the course of evolution, several experts said, Mother Nature had focused on the survival and reproduction of plants, not on putting out the maximum amount of seeds or fruits for humans to come along and pick. Dr. Long thought crop yields might be improved by certain genetic changes. Other scientists doubted it would work, but with the Science paper, Dr. Long and his collaborator — Krishna K. Niyogi, who holds appointments at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory — have gone a long way toward proving their point. Much of the work at the University of Illinois was carried out by two young researchers from abroad who hold positions in Dr. Long’s laboratory, Johannes Kromdijk of the Netherlands and Katarzyna Glowacka of Poland. No one plans to eat tobacco, of course, nor does the Gates Foundation have any interest in increasing the production of that health-damaging crop. But the researchers used it because tobacco is a particularly fast and easy plant in which to try new genetic alterations to see how well they work. In a recent interview here, Dr. Kromdijk and Dr. Glowacka showed off tiny tobacco plants incorporating the genetic changes and described their aspirations. We hope it translates into food crops in the way we’ve shown in tobacco, Dr. Kromdijk said. Of course, you only know when you actually try it. In the initial work, the researchers transferred genes from a common laboratory plant, known as thale cress or mouse-ear cress, into strains of tobacco. The effect was not to introduce alien substances, but rather to increase the level of certain proteins that already existed in tobacco. When plants receive direct sunlight, they are often getting more energy than they can use, and they activate a mechanism that helps them shed it as heat — while slowing carbohydrate production. The genetic changes the researchers introduced help the plant turn that mechanism off faster once the excessive sunlight ends, so that the machinery of photosynthesis can get back more quickly to maximal production of carbohydrates. It is a bit like a factory worker taking a shorter coffee break before getting back to the assembly line. But the effect on the overall growth of the tobacco plants was surprisingly large. When the scientists grew the newly created plants in fields at the University of Illinois, they achieved yield increases of 13.5 percent in one strain, 19 percent in a second and 20 percent in a third, over normal tobacco plants grown for comparison. Because the machinery of photosynthesis in many of the world’s food crops is identical to that of tobacco, theory suggests that a comparable manipulation of those crops should increase production. Work is planned to test that in crops that are especially important as dietary staples in Africa, like cowpeas, rice and cassava. Two outside experts not involved in the research both used the word exciting to describe it. But they emphasized that the researchers had not yet proved that the food supply could be increased. How does it look in rice or corn or wheat or sugar beets? said L. Val Giddings, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation in Washington and a longtime advocate of gene-altered crops. You’ve got to get it into a handful of the important crops before you can show this is real and it’s going to have a huge impact. We are not there yet. Barry D. Bruce of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, who studies photosynthesis, pointed out that the genetic alteration might behave differently in crops where only parts of the plant, such as seeds or fruits, are harvested. In tobacco, by contrast, the entire aboveground plant is harvested — Dr. Bruce called it a leafy green plant used for cigars! Dr. Bruce also noted that, now that the principle has been established, it might be possible to find plant varieties with the desired traits and introduce the changes into crops by conventional breeding, rather than by genetic engineering. Dr. Long and his group agreed this might be possible. The genetic engineering approach, if it works, may well be used in commercial seeds produced by Western agricultural companies. One of them, Syngenta, has already signed a deal to get a first look at the results. But the Gates Foundation is determined to see the technology, assuming its early promise is borne out, make its way to African farmers at low cost. The work is, in part, an effort to secure the food supply against the possible effects of future climate change. If rising global temperatures cut the production of food, human society could be destabilized, but more efficient crop plants could potentially make the food system more resilient, Dr. Long said. We’re in a year when commodity prices are very low, and people are saying the world doesn’t need more food, Dr. Long said. But if we don’t do this now, we may not have it when we really need it."}

{"id":562,"title":"Protein linked to Parkinson’s travels from gut to brain","class":1,"body":"SAN DIEGO — Over the course of months, clumps of a protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease can travel from the gut into the brains of mice, scientists have found. The results, reported November 14 at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, suggest that in some cases, Parkinson’s may get its start in the gut. That’s an intriguing concept, says neuroscientist John Cryan of the University College Cork in Ireland. The new study shows how important gut health can be for brain health and behavior. Collin Challis of Caltech and colleagues injected clumps of synthetic alpha-synuclein, a protein known to accumulate in the brains of people with Parkinson’s, into mice’s stomachs and intestines. The researchers then tracked alpha-synuclein with a technique called CLARITY, which makes parts of the mice’s bodies transparent. Seven days after the injections, researchers saw alpha-synuclein clumps in the gut. Levels there peaked 21 days after the injections. These weren’t the same alpha-synuclein aggregates that were injected, though. These were new clumps, formed from naturally occurring alpha-synuclein, that researchers believe were coaxed into forming by the synthetic versions in their midst. Also 21 days after the injections, alpha-synuclein clumps seemed to have spread to a part of the brain stem containing nerve cells that make up the vagus nerve, a neural highway that connects the gut to the brain. Sixty days after the injections, alpha-synuclein had accumulated in the midbrain, a region packed with nerve cells that make the chemical messenger dopamine. These are the nerve cells that die in people with Parkinson’s, a progressive brain disorder that affects movement. After reaching the brain, alpha-synuclein spreads thanks in part to brain cells called astrocytes, a second study suggests. Experiments with cells in dishes showed that astrocytes can store up and spread alpha-synuclein among cells. That work was presented by Jinar Rostami of Uppsala University in Sweden at a news briefing on November 14. The gradual accumulation and spread of alpha-synuclein caused trouble in the mice. As alpha-synuclein clumps slowly crept brainward, the mice began exhibiting gut and movement problems. Seven days after the injections, the mice’s stool was more plentiful than usual. Sixty and 90 days after the injections — after clumps of alpha-synuclein had reached the brain — the mice performed worse on some physical tests, including getting a sticker off their face and flipping around to shimmy down a pole headfirst. In many ways, the mice resembled other mice that have mutations that cause Parkinson’s-like symptoms, Challis says. An earlier study turned up evidence that clumps of alpha-synuclein can move from the gut to the brain stem in rats, but those experiments looked at shorter time scales, Challis says. And previous work monitored the movements of the injected alpha-synuclein, as opposed to the alpha-synuclein clumps that the mice produced themselves. The idea that alpha-synuclein can spread from the gut to the brain is very new, says Alice Chen-Plotkin, a clinician and Parkinson’s researcher at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. These new results and others have prompted scientists to start looking outside of the brain for the beginning stages of the disease, she says. Increasingly, people are wondering if it starts earlier.  Some evidence suggests that the gut is a good place to look. People with Parkinson’s disease often suffer from gut problems such as constipation. And in 2015, scientists reported that a group of Danish people who had their vagus nerves severed were less likely to develop Parkinson’s disease. Cut alpha-synuclein’s transit route from the gut to the brain, and the disease is less likely to take hold, that study hints. It’s not clear why alpha-synuclein accumulates in the gut in the first place. There are a lot of theories out there, Challis says. Bacteria may produce compounds called curli that prompt alpha-synuclein to aggregate, a recent study suggests. Pesticides, acid reflux and inflammation are other possible culprits that could somehow increase alpha-synuclein clumps in the gut, Challis says."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":563,"title":"Hidden cluster of galaxies may be moving the Milky Way","class":1,"body":"Our Milky Way and its neighboring galaxies are on the move. The whole Local Group of more than 50 galaxies is being tugged in one direction by, astronomers presume, the gravity of some enormous unseen object. Now, an international team believes they’ve found the culprit: a nearby supercluster—a collection of many hundreds of galaxies—that has never before been noticed because the gas, dust, and stars of our own Milky Way are blocking the view. Earlier studies of the Local Group’s motion led to predictions that there was something lurking beyond the Milky Way. Surveys of galaxies in the constellation Vela, through which the plane of our galaxy passes, also suggested there was a higher-than-normal density of galaxies in the area. So the team, using the 10-meter South African Large Telescope in Sutherland and the 3.9-meter Anglo-Australian Telescope in Siding Spring, measured the redshifts of 4500 galaxies in Vela, either side of the obscuring band of the Milky Way, and confirmed recently in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society that there is an overdensity of galaxies in that direction at a distance of 800 million light-years. That means our cosmic neighborhood is home to another giant structure, slightly further away than the Shapley Supercluster—previously thought to be the local giant. And thanks to the gravity of the newly named Vela Supercluster, we’re moving towards it at a cracking 50 kilometers per second. But there is no cause for alarm: At that speed it will take us 5 trillion years to get there."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":564,"title":"The Key To America's Future? Science","class":1,"body":"Growing up in a reasonably affluent family in Brazil, I have no doubt that my life changed forever when, as a 10-year-old, I watched the moon landing on live TV. How amazing was that? To see a human walking on the moon from the comfort of my uncle's bedroom in Rio? I was born two years after the Soviets launched Sputnik, an event that surely changed history as we know it, adding a new dimension to the Cold War. How many people looked up to the skies in awe, seeing that small, fast-moving dot of light, a man-made machine not much bigger than a beach ball inscribing its path away from Earth for the first time in history? National pride was hurt, and from a mix of fear of the Soviets controlling space and an intensely focused effort, the American space program took off to define the parameters of the space race. Now, a mere half a century later, we have launched machines to all planets of our solar system, exploring worlds that defy even the most creative of imaginations. Most Americans hardly understand the impact American science has worldwide. I don't mean just the technologies that everyone else on the globe (that can afford them) consumes or copies, or the might of its military. I mean the inspiration, in the minds of children, especially. People around the world watch the awesome movies, the TV shows, the NASA launches; they read the sci-fi books, the Marvel comics, the biographies of great scientists and inventors. How many Americans realize that one of the greatest, if not the greatest, legacies of this country are its amazing universities, incubators of some of the most creative ideas in the past 100 years? Ideas that have changed the world, that have shaped the way we live, that have saved (and taken) countless lives, that pave the way for what the future will be like. Manned missions to Mars, the privatization of the space race, self-driving cars, the explosion of social media platforms, renewable energy sources, the endless pursuit for new cures and vaccines, smart robots, ultrafast computers — these are the technologies that will define the 21st century, and they all depend crucially on science and scientific research. According to a report from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, from Jan. 1997 to Dec. 2015 the office granted 3,030,080 patents to U.S. entities, while the rest of the world combined was granted 2,709,771. Of these, 1,069,394 were given to Japanese entities. This trend is shifting now worldwide, with China taking a lead in the number of patent filings. There are many metrics to measure the impact of science in a country, and patents are only one. However, the trend is worrisome, as it shows a potential slowing down of American science. Patents relate to the creation and potential implementation of new ideas, some of which may be transformative. America's might is crucially dependent on its scientific base. This has been the history of this country, a country that developed the electric light, the airplane, the assembly line, the computer, the Apollo program, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Tesla. A huge amount of technologies we use every day — amounting to about 30 percent of the national GDP — depend on quantum physics in one way or another. Basic research that changed the world in unexpected ways. America is now at a crossroads, as a new government promises to redefine its political and economic direction. If campaign statements are taken seriously, a Trump government may have a very negative impact in the American scientific establishment, in particular in fundamental, or basic, research. (Historically, Republican governments are strong in defense funding.) For America to remain a dominant player in the world for the remainder of this century, it should not revert to a past where its strength was based on the extraction and refinement of oil and gas, and on industries sustained by coal-burning plants. This is an old model of progress, one that will not lead to the long-term growth of the American economy. Once the cup is empty, and it will become empty, you either get thirsty or find something else to drink. Despite loud climate change deniers, people are increasingly aware of the need for alternative renewable energy sources. Even for those who for some reason or another challenge that global warming is caused by humans, cleaner air to breathe is never a bad thing. I imagine coal miners would agree with that. If change is needed, it is in the redirecting of the old model and on the retraining of workers that now depend so crucially on it. What will happen to the 3.5 million truck drivers in the U.S. when self-driving trucks take over the interstates? We need a national Marshall plan to reeducate workers on the technologies of the present and the future. We need to unify America around the need for science and STEM education as the only guarantee for prosperity. Only education can keep America great. There is a new race out there, the race for digital technology dominance. Whoever leads it will define the parameters of the global economy for the next decades. More oil and coal burning will only choke our children and kill our forests. A new reality is calling, and we need to respond to its call together."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":565,"title":"Cryonics debate: 'Many scientists are afraid to hurt their careers'","class":1,"body":"Vital interrogation of the science behind cryogenically freezing humans is being stifled because scientists fear being ostracised and ridiculed, according to a leading researcher in the field. The cryobiologist Ramon Risco said scientists risked damaging their careers and being excluded from scientific societies if they worked on cryonics, the controversial science used last month to freeze the body of a 14-year-old cancer victim. There is an enormous ‘stigma bias’ to the conversation about cryonics among scientists, said Risco, who works on the cryopreservation of large human organs and tumour biopsies at the CryoBioTech cryobiology laboratory at the University of Seville. For scientists who would like to discuss it open-mindedly it tends to significantly hurt their career – in fact can potentially even get them kicked out of their scientific societies. The claim comes after the father of the teenage girl, who was granted her dying wish to have her body cryogenically frozen, accused those who provide the service of taking advantage of vulnerable people. The high court upheld the wishes of the teenager, known only as JS, who decided before her death from cancer that she wanted her body to be preserved in the hope that she could be brought back to life at a later time. Her estranged father initially opposed her wishes but changed his mind saying it was the last and only thing she has asked from me. But in an interview with the Mail on Sunday, he said that after discussions with the Cryonics Institute in Detroit, where his daughter’s body is stored, he remained strongly opposed. I believe they are selling false hope to those who are frightened of dying, taking advantage of vulnerable people, he said. When I asked if there was even a one in a million chance of my daughter being brought back to life, they could not say there was. But Risco argued that cryonics could not be dismissed solely as science fiction, and said it was likely that in five to 10 years experts would be able to revive a small mammal such as a mouse after it had been preserved in liquid nitrogen. It is very risky to say that anything is impossible in science or technology in the 21st century – people who use the word impossible are very brave, he said. If you are looking for the truth, why would you put barriers up? Risco also founded a start up, SafePreservation which enables customers to cryopreserve their biological material. Prof Anders Sandberg, a research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, said scientists reliant on grants and looking for tenures might exercise self-censorship. Many young scientists are afraid to hurt their careers, he said. Talking about the future can be very career-limiting. Being seen to be eccentric in the wrong way is frowned upon. Cryonics enthusiasts argue that the stigma surrounding the area could leave people vulnerable to unscrupulous companies ready to fill the void left by science. Tim Gibson of the non-profit group Cryonics UK, which prepared the 14-year-old’s body for transportation to the freezing facility in Michigan, said the group, all of whose staff are volunteers, would welcome regulation. The danger for us is that as the idea gets more publicity, companies wanting to make a profit could spring up and damage us by [taking advantage of clients], he said. The judge who ruled on the 14-year-old’s case was critical of how the process had been carried out, stating: The voluntary organisation is said to have been under-equipped and disorganised, resulting in pressure being placed on the hospital to allow procedures that had not been agreed. Gibson disputed that, saying body preparation and freezing had been done within the law and required protcols despite a mechanical failure which meant an ambulance used by the group was substituted by a van. Gibson said the group’s Facebook page membership had increased by 25%, to around 400, since Friday. The phone has not stopped ringing and I have about 200 emails to answer, he said. Clive Coen, a professor of neuroscience at King’s College London, has called for a ban on the marketing of cryonics. He said the idea of preserving a whole body was ridiculous and a whole brain only slightly less ridiculous. The cosmologist and astrophysicist Martin Rees said he did not believe research was being stifled. There are serious people working on it and they are aware that, though embryos can be preserved, it’s immensely unlikely that it would ever work for humans, said Rees. But even if it were a desirable development – and I actually think it wouldn’t be – most serious scientists would choose not to work on it because they don’t think the problem is timely or tractable. But those interested in the area who were hopeful that scientific developments could see the reanimation of humans who had been cryogenically frozen would continue to work under the radar, said Risco. He added that unconventional concepts such as in vitro fertilisation, space travel and organ transplantation had all suffered initial bias. We don’t need to start making a big polemic, he said. We will keep on working on organ cryopreservation, no one will call us crazy and eventually we will end up with a solution for the whole body."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":566,"title":"Scientists have developed a synthetic way to absorb CO2 that's way faster than plants","class":1,"body":"The conventional logic when it comes to addressing Earth's dangerously high carbon dioxide (CO2) levels is to figure out ways to make sure we pump less CO2 into the air in the first place. But plant life also helps to reduce humanity's carbon footprint, sucking up about 25 percent of our carbon emissions to produce fuel for itself during photosynthesis. The only problem is, nature's system for doing this is pretty slow and inefficient, but what if it could be boosted? That's the thinking behind a new study from German researchers, who have developed a synthetic system to incorporate CO2 into organic compounds – called carbon fixation – which is both dramatically faster than nature's method and more energy efficient. When plants absorb carbon during what's known as the Calvin cycle – the second stage of photosynthesis – an enzyme called RuBisCO helps catalyse the reaction that turns CO2 into glucose, which plants use as an energy source. The drawback with this system, according to lead researcher Tobias Erb from the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, is that RuBisCO itself isn't exactly quick, which holds the whole process up. RuBisCO is slow, he told William Herkewitz at Popular Mechanics, adding that it's also error-prone. [I]t backfires often, meaning about every fifth attempt RuBisCO will mix up CO2 with oxygen gas, he explains, which further slows carbon absorption. To see if they could engineer a better artificial system, Erb's team sifted through a library of some 40,000 known enzymes from all walks of life. Some enzymes are found in the human body, and gut bacteria, he says, while others were sourced from plants, and microbes that live in the oceans and on the surface of plants. From this massive catalogue, the researchers ended up identifying 17 different enzymes from 9 different organisms, and engineered them into a new 11-step system that effectively recreates the Calvin cycle – but with superior results. These enzymes, which belong to a group called ECRs, could pave the way for a new kind of organic carbon capture system that's potentially way more effective than the shrub on your window sill. ECRs are supercharged enzymes that are capable of fixing CO2 at the rate of nearly 20 times faster than the most widely prevalent CO2-fixing enzyme in nature, RuBisCo, which carries out the heavy lifting involved in photosynthesis, Erb said in a press release. Given that the process has only been trialled in a test tube so far, it's too early to say how much faster the system could be at capturing atmospheric carbon in the real world. Erb estimates that it could potentially be up to two or three times as quick as plants, but acknowledges it's all speculation until further research is carried out. Thus far, our artificial CO2-fixation cycle is a proof-of-principle, he told Maarten Rikken at ResearchGate. The transplantation of such a 'new metabolic heart' into living organisms, such as algae or plants is another big challenge. But if scientists can figure out how to incorporate this synthetic carbon fixation cycle into living plants or some other kind of CO2-absorbing organism, it might one day be a big help in removing these heat-trapping molecules from our atmosphere – and that can only be a good thing. This is an exciting outcome for systems biology, demonstrating that novel theoretical CO2 fixation pathways can indeed be realised, plant biologist Lisa Ainsworth from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who was not part of the research, told Eva Botkin-Kowacki at The Christian Science Monitor. Whether this pathway or another novel pathway could be engineered into plants is an open question, but this research certainly advances the possibility."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":567,"title":"AI science search engines expand their reach","class":1,"body":"A free AI-based scholarly search engine that aims to outdo Google Scholar is expanding its corpus of papers to cover some 10 million research articles in computer science and neuroscience, its creators announced on 11 November. Since its launch last year, it has been joined by several other AI-based academic search engines, most notably a relaunched effort from computing giant Microsoft. Semantic Scholar, from the non-profit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) in Seattle, Washington, unveiled its new format at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in San Diego. Some scientists who were given an early view of the site are impressed. This is a game changer, says Andrew Huberman, a neurobiologist at Stanford University, California. It leads you through what is otherwise a pretty dense jungle of information. The search engine first launched in November 2015, promising to sort and rank academic papers using a more sophisticated understanding of their content and context. The popular Google Scholar has access to about 200 million documents and can scan articles that are behind paywalls, but it searches merely by keywords. By contrast, Semantic Scholar can, for example, assess which citations to a paper are most meaningful, and rank papers by how quickly citations are rising — a measure of how ‘hot’ they are. When first launched, Semantic Scholar was restricted to 3 million papers in the field of computer science. Thanks in part to a collaboration with AI2’s sister organization, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the site has now added millions more papers and new filters catering specifically for neurology and medicine; these filters enable searches based, for example, on which part of the brain part of the brain or cell type a paper investigates, which model organisms were studied and what methodologies were used. Next year, AI2 aims to index all of PubMed and expand to all the medical sciences, says chief executive Oren Etzioni. The one I still use the most is Google Scholar, says Jose Manuel Gómez-Pérez, who works on semantic searching for the software company Expert System in Madrid. But there is a lot of potential here. Microsoft’s revival Semantic Scholar is not the only AI-based search engine around, however. Computing giant Microsoft quietly released its own AI scholarly search tool, Microsoft Academic, to the public this May, replacing its predecessor, Microsoft Academic Search, which the company stopped adding to in 2012. Microsoft’s academic search algorithms and data are available for researchers through an application programming interface (API) and the Open Academic Society, a partnership between Microsoft Research, AI2 and others. The more people working on this the better, says Kuansan Wang, who is in charge of Microsoft's effort. He says that Semantic Scholar is going deeper into natural-language processing — that is, understanding the meaning of full sentences in papers and queries — but that Microsoft’s tool, which is powered by the semantic search capabilities of the firm's web-search engine Bing, covers more ground, with 160 million publications. Like Semantic Scholar, Microsoft Academic provides useful (if less extensive) filters, including by author, journal or field of study. And it compiles a leaderboard of most-influential scientists in each subdiscipline. These are the people with the most ‘important’ publications in the field, judged by a recursive algorithm (freely available) that judges papers as important if they are cited by other important papers. The top neuroscientist for the past six months, according to Microsoft Academic, is Clifford Jack of the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota. Other scholars say that they are impressed by Microsoft’s effort. The search engine is getting close to combining the advantages of Google Scholar’s massive scope with the more-structured results of subscription bibliometric databases such as Scopus and the Web of Science, says Anne-Wil Harzing, who studies science metrics at Middlesex University, UK, and has analysed the new product. The Microsoft Academic phoenix is undeniably growing wings, she says. Microsoft Research says it is working on a personalizable version — where users can sign in so that Microsoft can bring applicable new papers to their attention or notify them of citations to their own work — by early next year. Other companies and academic institutions are also developing AI-driven software to delve more deeply into content found online. The Max Planck Institute for Informatics, based in Saarbrücken, Germany, for example, is developing an engine called DeepLife specifically for the health and life sciences. These are research prototypes rather than sustainable long-term efforts, says Etzioni. In the long term, AI2 aims to create a system that will answer science questions, propose new experimental designs or throw up useful hypotheses. In 20 years’ time, AI will be able to read — and more importantly, understand — scientific text, Etzioni says."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":568,"title":"European diseases left a genetic mark on Native Americans","class":1,"body":"When the indigenous peoples of the Americas encountered European settlers in the 15th century, they faced people with wildly different religions, customs, and—tragically—diseases; the encounters wiped out large swaths of indigenous populations within decades. Now, researchers have found that these diseases have also left their mark on modern-day populations: A new study suggests that infectious diseases brought by Europeans, from smallpox to measles, have molded the immune systems of today’s indigenous Americans, down to the genetic level. The immune system is a complex structure, built over a person’s life in response to environmental conditions. Antibodies, proteins that tag and attack viruses and bacteria, remember past invaders, allowing white blood cells to quickly respond during subsequent infections. Because different groups of people encounter different diseases—the European settlers had high exposure to smallpox, measles, and influenza thanks to close contact with livestock—they develop different antibodies. But what about the genes behind the immune system? Could those also change vulnerability to certain diseases? To find out, a team led by Ripan Malhi, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois in Urbana, sought permission from the Tsimshian, a First Nations community in the Prince Rupert Harbor region of British Columbia in Canada, to examine DNA from the skeletal remains of 25 individuals who lived in the region between 500 and 6000 years ago. These ancient indigenous inhabitants, many of them ancestors to the modern Tsimshian, were a seafaring people who first encountered Europeans in the early 1700s. Using a technique known as whole exome sequencing, researchers—including Tsimshian scientists Barbara Petzelt and Joycelynn Mitchell—sifted through the DNA for genes related to immune response. They then sequenced DNA samples from 25 Tsimshian living near Prince Rupert today. Comparing the two sets of genes, the team discovered several immune-related gene variants that were rare among the living. For example, a variant of a gene known as a HLA-DQA1, which codes for proteins that sort healthy cells from invading viruses and bacteria, was found in nearly 100% of ancient individuals, but in only 36% of modern ones. That finding suggests that the immune-related genes of the ancient Tsimshian were well-adapted to local diseases but not to novel infections like smallpox and measles, the team reports today in Nature Communications. Because European-borne epidemics altered the disease landscape, survivors were less likely to carry variants like HLA-DQA1, which were less able to cope with the new diseases (precisely how is still a mystery). Those ancient genetic variants that were once adaptive were no longer adaptive after European contact, Malhi says. Measuring differences between the ancient and modern DNA, Malhi and colleagues calculated a rough date for the genetic shift, about 175 years ago. At that time, smallpox epidemics raged throughout the Americas, including in Prince Rupert Harbor. Those with the most susceptible immune system genes were killed. Based on the new findings and historical accounts, the team says that close to 80% of the community died in the decades following initial European contact. Kim TallBear, a native studies researcher at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, says the study is well designed and provides deeper genetic resolution on what we already know. Still, she’s concerned the paper suggests that indigenous people are defined by their differences with Europeans, rather than by their adaption to their own environment. Within the dominant scientific narrative, the European body is the standard and indigenous bodies are thought of as biologically deviant, TallBear says. Going forward, Malhi plans to investigate the immune-related genes of other indigenous communities. Jennifer Raff, an anthropologist and geneticist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, agrees that it’s an important question going forward. Different tribes had different experiences of contact, she says. It’s critically important to study the specific genetic consequences in populations across the Americas."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":569,"title":"Vaccines that rob microbes of iron could fight food poisoning, UTIs","class":1,"body":"You’re probably not aware of it, but when you’re suffering from a bad case of food poisoning or another infection, bacteria are busy stealing iron from you. Many microbes use special chemicals to snatch away the metal, which they need to reproduce. But this need could be their downfall, according to new research. For the first time, two separate groups have developed candidate vaccines that protect against infection by targeting iron-scavenging molecules. The shots didn't prevent disease in mice, but they did slow down infection, showing the concept might work. Iron is a hot commodity inside the human body. The metal is essential for producing energy and replicating DNA; it has a starring role in hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen inside red blood cells. Bacteria also need iron to grow and divide, and they have special molecules called siderophores that bind to the metal and rip it right out of the proteins in which it is ensconced. Siderophores then ferry the precious cargo back to the bacterial cell by binding to a specialized receptor. Scientists have tried to exploit this mechanism by devising vaccines that unleash antibodies against the receptors. A few have shown promise, but the receptors repel water and are insoluble, making the vaccine harder to manufacture. An alternative approach is to target the siderophores themselves. The problem is that siderophores aren’t naturally good at revving up the immune system, since they’re so small. To make them more visible to B cells and other immune responders, two groups of scientists decided to hook up synthesized siderophores to so-called carrier proteins, large proteins that the immune system views as foreign, and try the resulting conjugates as vaccines. A group at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor designed a vaccine targeting the siderophores of Escherichia coli urinary tract infections, while a team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California (UC), Irvine, took aim at a Salmonella strain that causes food poisoning. Each group immunized mice with their conjugate; several weeks later, they challenged the animals with a big dose of bacteria. As the researchers reported in a pair of papers in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this month, the siderophore shots didn't prevent disease; vaccinated mice still developed infections, many of which were severe. But vaccinated mice had dramatically fewer bacteria in their bodies compared with mice that received a dose of the carrier protein alone. In the E. coli study, for instance, vaccinated mice had at least 10 times fewer E. coli in their urine and kidneys, which—along with their bladders—were less inflamed than those of control mice. In the Salmonella experiments, bacterial numbers were as much as 20,000-fold lower in the vaccinated mice and scientists also identified antibodies specific to the siderophores that seem responsible for the protection. These results are important, say the researchers, but they are still first steps. It was kind of long shot, but it worked, says Manuela Raffatellu, a microbiologist at UC Irvine and a senior author on the Salmonella study. It's certainly not ready for prime time, concedes Harry Mobley, a bacteriologist who led the E. coli study at Michigan. Nevertheless, he’s very excited about the finding. Mobley hopes that a similar vaccine can be tested in humans 5 years from now. Because related species of disease-causing bacteria often produce chemically similar siderophores, a single vaccine might work against a variety of different bacteria, he says. Eric Skaar, a microbiologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, who was not involved with the work, calls the findings pretty impressive. Any time two different groups have very similar results using similar strategies, it really speaks to the robustness, he says. The results provide an important proof of concept, adds James Johnson, an infectious disease physician at the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Health Care System in Minnesota. He says such vaccines could be an alternative to antibiotics, which are becoming increasingly ineffective and often wipe out good bacteria as well: We really do need to push this line of investigation further because of the antibiotic resistance crisis we're having now."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":570,"title":"Scientists have identified an antibody that neutralises 98% of HIV strains","class":1,"body":"Scientists have discovered an antibody produced by an HIV-positive patient that neutralises 98 percent of all HIV strains tested - including most of the strains that are resistant to other antibodies of the same class. Due to HIV’s ability to rapidly respond to the body’s immune defences, an antibody that can block a wide range of strains has been very hard to come by. But now that we’ve found one, it could form the basis of a new vaccine against the virus. Researchers from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that the antibody, called NG, was able to maintain its ability to recognise the HIV virus, even as the virus morphed and broke away from it. It’s also up to 10 times more potent than VRC01 - an antibody in the same class as N6, which has progressed to phase II clinical trials in human patients, after protecting monkeys against HIV for nearly six months. The discovery and characterisation of this antibody with exceptional breadth and potency against HIV provides an important new lead for the development of strategies to prevent and treat HIV infection, said Anthony S. Fauci from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. An antibody is a protein produced by the immune system in response to harmful pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Antibodies are responsible for identifying and destroying these pathogens by binding to them and either neutralising their biological effects on their own, or signalling to white blood cells to come and destroy them. When the researchers exposed N6 to 181 different strains of HIV, it managed to destroy 98 percent of them, including 16 of 20 strains resistant to other antibodies of the same class. That's a significant step up from the VRC01 antibody, which stops up to 90 percent of HIV strains from infecting human cells. And, as the researchers report, not only did N6 show extraordinary breadth - it's coupled that with incredible potency: Of those antibodies being considered for clinical development, there are examples of antibodies that are extremely broad but moderate in potency (e.g. 10E8 or VRC01) or extremely potent and less broad (e.g. PGT121 or PGDM1400). However, the discovery of the N6 antibody demonstrates that this new VRC01-class antibody can mediate both extraordinary breadth and potency even against isolates traditionally resistant to antibodies in this class. So why is N6 so successful against HIV? The researchers tracked its evolution over time to see how it responded to the shape-shifting defences of the HIV virus, and found that it relied less on binding with parts of the virus that are prone to changing - known as the V5 region - and more on parts that change very little across different strains. By attaching to these more consistent parts of the virus, N6 is able to prevent HIV from attaching itself to a host's immune cells and attacking them - which is what makes HIV-positive people so vulnerable to AIDS. N6 evolved such that its binding was relatively insensitive to the absence or loss of individual contacts typically found in the VRC01 class, the team reports. They also found that mutations of the HIV virus that happened to be resistant to N6 rarely cropped up, which suggests that the virus couldn't respond to this antibody as quickly as it has with other treatments scientists have discovered recently. The rare occurrence of N6 resistance mutations suggests that such mutations come at a relatively high fitness cost, which might represent a partial barrier to the selection of resistant mutants, the team explains. Of course, these results have so far only been demonstrated in the lab, so until we see the same levels of success in actual human trials, we need to remain cautiously optimistic. But with a recent trial of a different treatment appearing to have erased HIV from a patient’s blood, and researchers honing in on whatever seems to be preventing one in 10 kids from catching the virus, we're making real progress against the disease. Maybe this is how we end up beating it."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":571,"title":"Radio burst hits Earth from a billion light-years away","class":1,"body":"Every day, space is filled with thousands of mysterious bursts of radio energy, enormous flashes that typically pack as much energy into a few milliseconds as the sun emits in all wavelengths in half a day. Nobody knows what causes these fast radio bursts (FRBs), but theories include such dramatic possibilities as colliding neutron stars or neutron stars being eaten by black holes. Now, a team of astronomers has witnessed the brightest such flash to date. Because it was so bright, the scientists could observe how the signal was altered by the intergalactic medium through which it traveled, much as starlight’s passage through Earth’s atmosphere makes stars twinkle. Based on how the signal dispersed and distorted, the team confirmed that the signal had been traveling for at least a billion years—meaning its source was at least a billion light-years away, they report today in Science. The team also used the flash to determine properties of the tenuous plasmas between galaxies—such as magnetism and turbulence, confirming earlier theories that it is neither highly magnetized nor turbulent. That’s important, say the scientists, because there are few other ways to study the galactic medium, which contains nearly 40% of all nondark matter in the galaxy. But because FRBs occur without warning and don’t repeat, it’s unlikely that scientists will get a similar chance any time soon. The team, which was watching a neutron star in our own galaxy, was lucky enough to be pointing its telescope in precisely the right direction."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":572,"title":"Scientists have rejuvenated old mice with the blood of human teenagers","class":1,"body":"It might sound like something out of a creepy folk tale, but scientists have found evidence that injecting young human blood into older bodies does seem to offer powers of rejuvenation – even if those old bodies aren't human themselves. In a new study, researchers took blood samples from a group of healthy, young 18-year-old human participants and injected them into 12-month-old mice – late middle age in mice years, or the equivalent of being about 50 years old in human terms. For three weeks, the mice received twice-weekly injections of human blood plasma – blood's liquid component, which scientists think is responsible for its rejuvenating properties. After this, scientists from California-based biopharmaceutical company Alkahest compared the injected animals' behaviour to young and old control groups of three-month-old and 12-month-old mice – neither of which had received the plasma injections. The new blood made the old mice act young again, with the treated animals running around in open spaces much like their younger controls. But there was also evidence that their powers of memory had improved. The researchers put the treated mice in a device called a Barnes maze – a tool used to measure spatial learning and memory in rodents. Due to weaker memory, older mice tend to fare poorly at navigating the Barnes maze, but in the tests, the treated animals performed as well as young mice. We see a rejuvenation effect, one of the Alkahest researchers, Sakura Minami, told Jessica Hamzelou at New Scientist. Young human plasma improves cognition. Their memory was preserved. According to neuroscientist and Alkahest founder, Karoly Nikolich, the rejuvenating properties of young blood are down to the different protein makeups of young and old plasma. Plasma contains thousands of proteins, but while young plasma contains a number of proteins that can rejuvenate tissues, with age these disappear and are replaced by damaging molecules. We have, actually, now for the first time discovered that there are hundreds of proteins that change with ageing, Nikolich told Juliette Goodrich and Molly McCrea at CBS. What we see in ageing plasma is that there is an increase of proteins that are inflammatory, that cause cell death. As for what these proteins are exactly, the researchers aren't sharing those details just yet. But Minami says they not only have an effect on tissues in the body, but some are crossing over into the brain. When the team examined cross sections of the brains of the mice that received the plasma treatment and compared them with similarly aged mice that hadn't received the injections, they saw the treated animals had greater amounts of newly formed neurons. Neurons are formed in what's called neurogenesis, which is important for our ability to learn and memorise, and the mice brains suggest young human plasma increases the process. It's pretty dramatic, Minami told CBS. [When we] do treatment we see a doubling of that. The study was presented at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in San Diego this week, but it's important to note that it hasn't been published or peer-reviewed by other scientists yet. So we need to bear that in mind while we consider the potential reach of this research – especially as the effects have only been demonstrated in mice so far. But it's not the first study to find rejuvenation in mice due to young blood. A number of studies in 2014 found that blood infusions from young mice to older mice improved the older animals' cognition and strength – although the Alkahest research could be the first to find that human blood confers the same benefits across the two species. The Alkahest researchers now want to investigate if young human plasma can do the same thing for older people too, and have begun a clinical trial at Stanford University involving 18 people with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease. If this trial proves successful, they hope to follow it up with a larger study involving more patients and greater plasma doses, to see if neurogenesis stimulated by young blood can counter the inflammation that leads to cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. It's not the only company looking into this kind of research. Another US startup called Ambrosia is currently recruiting volunteers for a clinical trial in which people aged 35 or older can receive a one-off injection of young plasma. It's unclear though what anti-ageing benefits a one-off treatment would confer – and the trial has also attracted some criticism for charging participants a US$8,000 fee to cover costs. That said, any studies in this area attracts a lot of attention – most notably from tech entrepreneur and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, whose personal interest in blood-based anti-ageing treatments has seen him channel millions into health research. Ultimately, Alkahest says it would manufacture synthetic versions of the proteins required, as there isn't enough natural young human plasma in the world to help the number of people facing Alzheimer's. But that's still a while away. For now, all eyes our focused on the first clinical trial, in which we'll get our first chance of seeing if young blood can help people as well as mice. The final results will come at the end of the year, Nikolich told CBS."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":573,"title":"Russian scientists 'discover NOAH'S FLOODWATER at bottom of deepest hole in the world'","class":1,"body":"RUSSIAN scientists dug the world's deepest hole and discovered water from Noah's great flood, disproving the myth that the earth is made up of dry, rocky layers, it has been claimed. The Kola Borehole could only go down as deep as 12km before being blocked by a mystery force. A video exposing the so-called Kola conspiracy says the established view of the earth's makeup – crust, mantle and core – was proved wrong by the geological dig. Scientists were shocked to discover that instead of solid, dry, dense rock massive amounts of water were found. The video's publishers, Plano Existential, claim this proves the Biblical event of Noah's flood is a reality - and that the flood waters drained to this subterrannean sinkhole. The Biblical story of Noah’s flood has troubled theologians for centuries and not least among the questions was ‘what happened to the waters which flooded the earth’ – where exactly did they recede to? Now some Christians believe the discovery of water so far below ground explains and gives credence to the flood story not as an allegory but a historical event. The narrator said: Nobody has drilled into the mantle or crust so there's no observations as to what's under the crust. I would like you to question what we've been told. The back up the account of a great flood. Genesis refers to 'all the fountains of the great deep'. Rock shouldn't be porous but there's water there, supporting the claim that there was a great flood covering the entire earth. The Kola Borehole was mysteriously closed down in the early 1990s but it unearthed some other confusing discoveries. A persistent rumour about the plant's closure remains to this day – that scientists got scared when they 'drilled through into hell' and 'heard the screaming from tortured souls'.  More scientifically the dig team found helium, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide pockets inside the earth, which scientists previously thought impossible. There were also fossils found in granite more than 6,700 metres below the surface, with no explanation as to how they got there. And Kola is not the only big dig site on earth where mystery surrounds its discoveries. An oil field in Fairbanks, Alaska, was reported to have allowed Satan to climb out of hell and onto the face of the earth after drilling too deep. Weekly World News reported John Merritt, an alleged foreman with a major oil company, as saying: If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I would not believe it. The giant demon head of Satan has already escaped and his body has been slowly coming out for weeks. White-hot flames are billowing out of the well, the skies have been darkened by strange clouds and the area is full of an evil stench so oppressive and overpowering that most people can only stand to remain there for a few minutes."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":574,"title":"Listen to the music of proteins folding","class":1,"body":"Proteins, the building blocks of tissues and organs, also regulate how genes are expressed. So it’s important to determine how they work, something scientists typically do with visual images and graphs. Now, researchers have come up with a new way for analyzing how proteins function: music. Inspired by previous research mapping data to sound—like the famous chirp from the detection of gravitational waves—researchers decided to assign a musical pitch and rhythm to different qualities of three proteins, including their chemistry, affinity to water, and structure. Then, using melody generation software, they strung together the different notes to create melodies that could be played on a piano. (You can listen below.) To show that these auditory representations were as good as the visual ones, the researchers next asked a group of participants—mostly students who had studied both music and proteins—to listen to the melodies and match them to the images. They were right at least 70% of the time, even without the help of a visual aid, like the synchronized scroll bars often seen with karaoke lyrics, the scientists reported last month in Heliyon. This means, they say, that these recordings might allow researchers to use their ears, along with their eyes, to identify protein patterns indicative of genetic diseases like Alzheimer’s."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":575,"title":"Russian researchers reveal men spend more time switching between tasks than women","class":1,"body":"MOSCOW, November 15. /TASS/. Researchers from the Laboratory of Neurolinguistics of Higher School of Economy (HSE) have discovered that men spend more time and energy when switching between various tasks than women do, the HSE press service stated. The study was recently published in the journal Human Physiology. Neurobiologists carried out an experiment where 140 healthy subjects took part: 69 male and 71 female volunteers aged 20 to 65 years. The participants conducted various tasks switching from one to another. For example, they sorted figures by shape (rectangular or round) and then by number (one or two). Additionally, the subjects were involved in a neuropsychological test on refocusing between tasks (D-KEFS, or Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Trail Making Test) and the Wechsler test for evaluating aural and visual memory (Wechsler Memory Scale). The study demonstrated that women managed the tasks more efficiently than men without activating some additional resources of the brain. At the same time, to effectively switch from one task to another, men need to involve additional brain channels, noted Svetlana Kuptsova, one of the authors of the study. One might argue and speculate on the cherished desire of nature, Kuptsova said. It might be that in ancient times women had to undertake many tasks including homemaking and nursing. As a result of such multi-tasking, women’s brains picked up the ability to switch between different problems fast, she resumed. In the meantime, the researcher warns of hasty conclusions as this is a rather unproven hypothesis. The authors of the study have noted that this particular difference is specific for men and women aged 20 to 45-50 years. Beyond that age category and towards senior years, the brain of a woman starts to spend more time and resources when switching between problems and the male brain soon ‘catches up to her speed."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":576,"title":"Scientists have discovered the tallest tropical tree in the world","class":1,"body":"Researchers have announced the discovery of the tallest tropical tree in the world, with a towering 94.1-metre (309-foot) tree in Borneo eclipsing the previous record. In addition to finding the tallest known tree in the tropics, the research also identified the next 49 tallest trees – each of which stands greater than 90 metres (295 feet) in height – making for an unprecedented 50 record-breakers in a single haul. To get an idea of how big these trees really are, the researchers say the tallest is about the length of six sperm whales – each approximately 16 metres (52 feet) long – lined up snout to fluke (head to tail). I've been doing this for a solid 20 years now, and I have to say, this was one of the most moving experiences in my career, ecologist Gregory Asner from the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University told Mike Gaworecki at Mongabay. This tallest tropical tree, and the 49 runners-up, are truly phenomenal expressions of the power of nature. The find comes just months after another team from Cambridge University in the UK made headlines with the discovery of a tropical tree measuring 89.5 metres (293.6 feet) in Maliau Basin, a reserve in the Bornean state of Sabah. But Asner's team used laser scanning to find that another reserve in Sabah – called Danum Valley – contained a grove of trees with even greater stature. The researchers identified the trees' height with an aircraft called the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, which uses a laser-based system called LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) that can measure and map landscapes in three dimensions. This technique relies on the 500,000 laser shots per second that we fire out of the bottom of the plane as we fly, which provides a very detailed 3D view of the forest canopy down to the ground level, Asner told Mongabay. We then digitally process and comb the 3D data for the tallest trees (in this case). With the LiDAR data in hand, Asner returned to the area by helicopter, to make out the world's tallest tropical tree in a sea of green below. We aimed directly at the coordinates of the tree marked in our laser scanning data, he said. And there it was, sticking out above the rest of the canopy. As the tree has only been observed remotely at this point, the scientists haven't had a chance to confirm the species just yet, but it's likely to be in the genus Shorea, which encompasses almost 200 species of rainforest trees native to Southeast Asia. Borneo is home to 130 of these species – which can live for hundreds of years – but many are endangered by logging. To confirm the species, the team intends to visit each of the tallest 50 trees in the coming weeks – and it's fair to say that these giant specimens will make quite an impression when seen up close, much as they did when viewed from a helicopter. The crazy thing is that our tallest tree is immediately flanked to each side by a tree of the same species of Shorea, almost as tall! said Asner. So, there are three trees, like brothers, standing above the rest of the canopy. I almost cried as we circled the tree maybe 10 times before the pilot said we had to go back. But as staggering as that is, it's still not as tall as the tallest trees outside the tropics. The world's tallest tree anywhere – California redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) – have been measured as high as 115.5 metres (379 feet), putting even giant Shorea in the shade. The new study hasn't been published in a scientific journal yet, so we can't consider the claims regarding stature as having been verified until other scientists have had a chance to examine the research. Not that cataloguing these epic trees is just some kind of scientific one-upmanship though. Apart from measuring their physical stature, the aim of the Bornean research is to help us understand the sprawl and health of these forest populations, so that we can better defend them from threats like logging. Tallest tree aside, this work really highlights the value of protecting primary forests, one of the team, Glen Reynolds from the South East Asia Rainforest Research Program (SEARRP), told Kevin McLean at National Geographic. These ancient trees are really only found in primary forests, many of which are not properly protected. A detailed map like this will be useful for establishing conservation priorities. So while most of the attention the team gets will probably be a result of them having stumbled upon the tallest tree in the tropics, that fact doesn't bother them in the slightest. Conservation needs inspiration, and these sentinels of the Bornean jungle provide that to us, Asner told Mongabay. This discovery is a gift to science, to the people of Sabah and Borneo, and to the world. The findings were presented at the International Heart of Borneo Conference 2016 last week."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":577,"title":"How farming changed the dog","class":1,"body":"Farming didn’t just revolutionize human society—it transformed the genome of our oldest friend, the dog. A new study reveals that by 7000 years ago, our canine companions were eating so much wheat and millet they made extra copies of starch-digesting genes to help them cope. And this adaptation is what allowed them to stay by our sides, even as our world changed. The genetic evolution in dogs parallels what others have found in humans, says Peter Savolainen, an evolutionary geneticist at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, who was not involved with the work. With farming we started to eat starch, and both we and dogs had to adapt to this change. Some of the first insights into how farming changed the canine genome came 3 years ago. That’s when evolutionary geneticist Erik Axelsson of Uppsala University in Sweden and his colleagues discovered that dogs have four to 30 copies of a gene—Amy2B—that helps digest starch, whereas wolves typically only have two. Morgane Ollivier wanted to know just when that genetic change happened. A paleogeneticist at Ecole Normale Supéieure de Lyon in France, she teamed up with Axelsson and others, who extracted ancient DNA from the bones and teeth of 13 wolf and dog specimens collected from archaeological sites throughout Eurasia. Four of the ancient dogs—from a 7000-year-old site in Romania and 5000-year-old sites in Turkmenistan and France—had more than eight copies of Amy2B, Ollivier and her colleagues report today in Royal Society Open Science. They do not yet know how many copies ancient wolves had. Because these samples predate the emergence of dog breeds, believed to be within the past couple of centuries, the findings rule out a modern origin for the increase in copy number, says Laurent Frantz, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom who was not involved with the work. Adds Ollivier: This [expansion] probably constituted an important advantage for dogs feeding on human leftovers, as they hung around human settlements, perhaps serving as guard dogs. Dogs were likely domesticated more than 15,000 years ago, and as companions to hunter-gatherers, were likely eating mostly meat. Being able to survive on whatever humans discarded likely enabled dogs to become widespread as people migrated across the globe, says Robert Wayne, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved with the study. In humans, the number of copies of this starch gene increased just as it did in dogs during the same time period, Ollivier says. She suggests there may be similar parallels in the evolution of metabolism, immunity, and brain processes in both species. A 2016 survey of various types of dogs from around the world—as well as golden jackals, coyotes, and wolves—supports the new work. It found that almost all the wolves, jackals, and coyotes had just two copies of Amy2B. So did Siberian huskies and dingoes, both of which lived with people who, until recently, hunted or fished for most of their food. The rest of the dogs studied had many more copies of the gene. Farming led to a fivefold increase in the number of starch-digesting genes in these dogs, Axelsson, Savolainen, and their colleagues reported in July in Heredity. Together, says Savolainen, the two studies give a coherent picture of man’s influence on man’s oldest friend."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":578,"title":"Physicists just discovered a second state of liquid water","class":1,"body":"It’s one of the most fundamental compounds on Earth, and it makes up roughly 60 percent of the human body, and yet water is turning out to be stranger than we could have ever imagined. Researchers have been investigating the physical properties of water, and found that when it’s heated to between 40 and 60 degrees Celsius, it hits a 'crossover temperature', and appears to start switching between two different states of liquid. As a chemical compound, water is so vital to life on Earth, we’ve been underestimating how legitimately weird it is. We’ve all gotten so used to it, it’s hard to imagine things getting any more complex than the three basic states: solid, liquid, gas. (Under very rare circumstances, a plasma-like state can also form.) But in many ways, plain, old water is unlike any other substance on the planet. With the exception of Mercury, water has the highest surface tension of all liquids. It’s also one of the only known substances whose solid state can float on its liquid state, and unlike almost every other known substance, water expands when it freezes. It also has a bizarre boiling point. While the boiling points of other hydrides, such as hydrogen telluride and hydrogen sulphide, decrease as their molecule size decreases, H2O has a surprisingly large boiling point for such a small molecular weight. No one really understands water, Philip Ball points out in Nature. It’s embarrassing to admit it, but the stuff that covers two-thirds of our planet is still a mystery. Worse, the more we look, the more the problems accumulate: new techniques probing deeper into the molecular architecture of liquid water are throwing up more puzzles. Now physicists have demonstrated that somewhere between the temperatures of 40 and 60 degrees Celsius (104 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit), liquid water can 'switch' states, exhibiting a whole new set of properties depending on the state it flips to. To figure this out, an international team led by physicist Laura Maestro from the University of Oxford in the UK looked at a number of specific properties of water. They looked at things like thermal conductivity, refractive index, conductivity, surface tension, and the dielectric constant - how well an electric field can spread through a substance - and how they responded to fluctuations in temperature between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius. Once the water hit 40 degrees, things started to shift, and properties were changing all the way up to 60 degrees. Each property had a different 'crossover temperature' somewhere within this threshold, and the researchers suggest that this is because the liquid water had switched into a different phase. The team lists a few of these crossover temperatures: approximately 64 degrees Celsius for thermal conductivity, 50 degrees Celsius for refractive index, about 53 degrees Celsius for conductivity, and 57 degrees Celsius for surface tension. These results confirm that in the 0-100 degrees Celsius range, liquid water presents a crossover temperature in many of its properties close to 50 degrees Celsius, they conclude. So what's going on here? It's not yet clear, but the fact that water could be switching between two entirely different states of liquid at certain temperatures could be linked to why H2O has such unusual properties in general. Water molecules maintain only very short-lived connections between each other, and these hydrogen bonds are actually far weaker than the bonds that link the individual hydrogen and oxygen atoms inside the molecules. For this reason, the hydrogen bonds that link water molecules together are constantly breaking and reforming, and yet within all that chaos, set structures and 'rules' persist. Physicists suspect that this is what gives water its unusual properties - but no one's entirely sure how it works. Everyone is agreed that one aspect of water’s molecular structure sets it apart from most other liquids: fleeting hydrogen bonds, Ball writes for Nature. These feeble bonds that link the molecules constantly break and form above water’s melting point, yet still impose a degree of structure on the molecular jumble. That’s where the consensus ends. While Maestro and her team's results will need to be replicated by an independent team before we can start rewriting textbooks to reflect the four (or 3.5?) states of water that could potentially exist, they say their discovery could have big implications for our understanding of both nano and biological systems. For example, the optical properties of metallic (gold and silver) nanoparticles dispersed in water, used as nanoprobes, and the emission properties of ... quantum dots, used for fluorescence bioimaging and tumour targeting, show a singular behaviour in this temperature range, they write in their paper. [It also] raises the question of whether temperature-driven structural changes in water affect biological macromolecules in aqueous solutions, and in particular in proteins, which are the vital functional biological units in living cells. The research has been published in the International Journal of Nanotechnology."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":579,"title":"Biomedical research leaders urge Trump administration to quickly appoint an NIH director","class":1,"body":"Like other scientific organizations, biomedical research advocates are scrambling to make contact with President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team to weigh in on his science policies and appointments. This week, a science star–studded group that including two former directors of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, released a set of recommendations aimed at making NIH run better and offered advice on choosing an NIH director—ideally within Trump’s first 100 days in office. We really wanted to stay clear of the open-hand message that just says, ‘If you give us more money we'll do better,’ says the group’s chair, molecular biologist Keith Yamamoto of the University of California, San Francisco. We tried to make recommendations that would be actionable without more money. The 27-page report, released on 14 November, comes from 12 science and policy experts, including former NIH directors Harold Varmus and Elias Zerhouni. It urges NIH to shore up basic research and backs suggestions from previous high-level reports that the agency fund more investigators based on their track record and not specific research projects, and rely more heavily on fellowships and training grants rather than research grants to train the new generation. The group suggests that the new administration review NIH’s structure of 27 institutes and centers mostly based on organs or disease. Varmus pushed for an overhaul years ago and current NIH Director Francis Collins attempted to make changes, but didn’t get far. We understand the inertia and political forces that make these things very difficult, but this was so important to the committee that we felt it we should raise it again, Yamamoto says. One fresh recommendation is for NIH to broaden the expertise of peer review panels so they can better assess transdisciplinary research. The report also suggests a grants program to support NIH’s in-house scientists when they move into academia, a move that would help convert the agency’s intramural program into an incubator for early stage investigators. The most urgent task for the Trump administration is to appoint a wise and bold Director within 100 days who should be familiar with NIH, says the group, which began working on its report in July with funding from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. Yamamoto said his team is also working up a list of names to lead NIH and the National Cancer Institute. On a visit to Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., yesterday to discuss NIH matters with key members such as Representative Tom Cole (R–OK), who chairs the House of Representatives committee that oversees NIH’s budget, Yamamoto was struck by what he described as chaos in both parties. His group also made contact with Trump ally Newt Gingrich, who may not be directly involved with science appointments but who Yamamoto said is hugely influential and very strongly supportive of NIH. Yamamoto is also hoping that Ben Carson, the former presidential candidate and retired pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, will be a sympathetic listener. Colleagues from Hopkins felt he was someone we can talk to, Yamamoto says about Carson, who has ruled himself out for a cabinet post but expects to remain as an adviser to the president-elect. There’s no official word from Collins about his plans. But his longtime right-hand adviser Kathy Hudson, NIH deputy director for science, outreach, and policy, who had said before the election that she planned to leave NIH, tweeted this week that she's departing on 16 December to spend time with her family and look for her next adventure. Some observers suggest Collins will also be ready to step down soon."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":580,"title":"Has a new mutation in the Ebola virus made it deadlier?","class":1,"body":"The sheer size of the Ebola epidemic that began in 2013 and engulfed West Africa is still a bit of a riddle for scientists. Previous Ebola outbreaks had never sickened more than 600 people. But the outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea infected more than 28,000 before it was finally brought under control. Part of the explanation was that the virus had suddenly surfaced in major cities, making it harder to stamp out than in the isolated rural locales where it had struck before. The countries’ poor public health infrastructure and other environmental factors played roles as well. But two papers raise another intriguing possibility. They show that some 3 months after the outbreak took off and became a full-blown epidemic, the virus underwent a mutation that made it better suited for humans than for its presumed natural host, a fruit bat species. The virus has never had this many human-to-human transmissions before, and there are a lot of mutations happening, says Harvard University’s Pardis Sabeti, an evolutionary geneticist who co-authored one of the papers. Sabeti stresses that her team only has a circumstantial case about the timing of the mutation and the epidemic’s explosion, but her group and an independent team that published the second study have amassed what she calls compelling evidence that for the first time links a mutation in the virus to a preference for human cells. The findings raise the possibility that this mutation contributed directly to greater transmission and thus to the severity of the outbreak, the team writes. And they found an association with increased mortality. We should neither be alarmist nor complacent, Sabeti says. Any possibility that one of the mutations can have a serious impact should be interrogated. Working with a team led by Jeremy Luban from the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Sabeti and co-workers sequenced samples from 1489 West African patients and analyzed them. By March 2014—about the time the epidemic was detected, but some 3 months after the first case actually occurred—the sequences had split into two distinct lineages, one of which was characterized by a single amino acid change in a region of the virus’s surface protein and allows it to bind to cells. The mutant, Luban says, completely supplanted the ancestral virus. The big question, of course, is whether the mutation could help the virus spread. The researchers did not have access to a biosafety level (BSL) 4 laboratory necessary to test that with the real Ebola virus, so they engineered harmless pseudotyped viruses that contained the gene for the surface protein in both its ancestral and mutated form. The mutant far more easily infected human immune cells than did the ancestral pseudotype, the team reports today in Cell. The researchers also showed that the mutant more easily infects primate cells than cells from rodents or carnivores. The second paper, published today in Cell by a team led by Jonathan Ball at the United Kingdom’s University of Nottingham and Etienne Simon-Loriere of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, independently arrived at a similar conclusion. The team analyzed its own 1610 sequences from the epidemic and also found that they separated into two lineages based on the single mutation in the glycoprotein. The researchers also compared pseudotyped Ebola viruses that matched the ancestor with ones with the same mutation, and found they preferentially infected cells from humans as opposed to the fruit bat species Hypsignathus monstrosus. They also found this mutant’s infectivity was increased by other mutations, which suggests that the virus didn’t undergo just one, but several adaptations allowing it to jump more easily from human to human. That could have complicated attempts to bring the epidemic to an end. But Ball, Simon-Loriere, and colleagues approach this conclusion most cautiously, stressing that epidemiologic factors, such as increased circulation in urban areas that in turn led to larger chains of transmission, likely were the most important driver. Despite the experimental data provided here, it is impossible to clearly establish whether the adaptive mutations observed were in part responsible for the extended duration of the 2013–16 epidemic, they write in their paper. A study published by Science in March of last year did not find any evidence that the virus evolved to become more transmissible or more virulent. But the first author of that paper, virologist Thomas Hoenen of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Riems, Germany, says the two new papers make a powerful case that the glycoprotein mutation benefited the virus. The question now is, what does this really mean in terms of biological consequences? Luban stresses that Hoenen’s analysis and others that reached similar conclusions weren’t wrong. But the researchers were analyzing viral sequences to address different questions—such as the viral mutation rate—or only looked at samples isolated in the early days of the outbreak. You have to do wet experiments sometimes, Luban says. All of the algorithm crunching suggested Ebola is Ebola is Ebola. These two experiments say it doesn’t matter what the computers say. The virus is more infectious. The authors of the new studies agree that to clarify the impact the mutation has on transmissibility and virulence, scientists must do experiments with the real virus and engineered mutants of it, both in cell cultures and animals. But they have had difficulty finding a BSL-4 lab that’s willing to collaborate and funding is a challenge, too. We need to pay attention to this, Sabeti says. The rapid adaptation to humans underscores the need to respond quickly to animal to human transmissions of Ebola and other viruses, she adds. Anytime you see one of these sparks ignite it could turn into full on forest fire."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":581,"title":"Why political science is not an election casualty","class":1,"body":"There's a lot of blame being tossed at political science after Trump's surprise victory. Most of it is undeserved. One of the fun things about a surprising political event is watching the reaction of writers with predetermined axes to grind. Don’t get me wrong, all of us have our pet arguments and theories. The most devoted pundits, however, figure out how to graft their favorite arguments onto an explanation for What Just Happened. Donald Trump’s solid victory in the electoral college certainly qualifies as a surprising political event. Indeed, the fact that it was surprising forms the core of political philosophy professor Jason Blakely’s latest article in the Atlantic, titled Is Political Science This Year’s Election Casualty? Blakely clearly believes that the answer is yes: Election forecasting is part of a wider trend in higher education to present the study of politics as a ‘science.’ But on November 8, 2016, the science of politics was almost uniformly and spectacularly wrong. We’ll revisit the claims in that sentence in a second, but for now, let’s ask what Blakely thinks political scientists will and should do in the wake of this alleged epic fail: Inevitably, higher education and the mainstream in political science will follow the same line of self-criticism. And no one would be surprised if the American Political Science Association (a more-than 13,000-member association of professional, academic political scientists) invites Nate Cohn, Nate Silver, or Sam Wang to a panel discussion next summer to argue about how to make a model and tweak technical differences. Yet when this happens, the larger philosophical questions — about whether the study of politics is indeed a science — will go unasked, and Americans will have missed a massive opportunity at self-correction in academia, the media, and society at large. … Humanists across the social sciences, history, literature, and legal studies have argued for decades that politics is not a science but one of the humanities. In the view of humanists like myself, political knowledge is much closer to history than to physics or biology. The reason for this, as the philosopher Charles Taylor famously put it, is because human beings are self-interpreting animals. That is, humans are creative agents whose beliefs are held for contingent reasons that can always change, and therefore not susceptible to the causal predictions of the natural sciences. This means demographics, economy, voting history, and the other classifications that political scientists and statistics gurus use to scientifically model predictions are never destiny for human beings. So, in other words, the author of a book about Charles Taylor thinks political scientists need to listen more to Charles Taylor. Now as someone who has noted this election cycle that political science theories can be self-refuting, I’m not completely unsympathetic to Blakely’s plea for attention to the discipline’s humanities side. But his entire argument rests on the belief that political science got it wrong in 2016. Let’s revisit that assumption. Most election prediction models in political science rest on a few core variables: economic indicators, the number of terms the incumbent party has been in power, etc. In August, Vox’s Dylan Matthews reported on what those models predicted for 2016: Jacob Montgomery of Washington University in St. Louis and Texas A&M’s Florian Hollenbach combined six such models into an ensemble model that blends them together based on historical accuracy. The forecast projected that Republicans would get 50.9 percent of the two-party vote and Democrats would receive 49.1 percent of the vote. As with any model, there’s a margin of error (the 95 percent confidence interval is from 43.61 percent of the vote for Democrats to 53.44 percent), but the point estimate was a GOP victory. But this is a so-called fundamentals model: It isn’t based on specific knowledge of the two nominees or what kinds of campaigns they’re running or how they’re polling each day. Instead, it relies more heavily on data that’s been predictive across past elections: the state of the economy, President Obama’s approval rating, the fact that Democrats are seeking a third term in the White House, and more. Now the point of Matthews’s essay was that Trump was underperforming those models in the polling. Indeed, Emory political science professor Alan Abramowitz, whose model had the best track recorded, disavowed it back in June because he thought Trump was such an out-of-bounds candidate. As it turns out, Abramowitz wasn’t entirely wrong. Trump did underperform the political science models, all of which focus on the popular vote. As of right now (votes are still being counted), Trump received 49.6 percent of the popular vote and Hillary Clinton received 50.4 percent. So, in the end, the political science models were off by a whopping percentage point in their collective prediction, in that they overestimated Trump’s voting share. Still, as Vox’s Andrew Prokop noted last week, these fundamental factors all pointed to a very close race that could conceivably go either way. Now if you read Blakely’s essay, you quickly realize his ire is focused on the use of polling as a predictor for the election. Even here, however, the average of the national polls showed a narrow Clinton victory in the popular vote. Which is what happened. As RealClearPolitics’ Sean Trende — whose analysis of this election cycle has been stellar — notes: In fact, despite the hue and cry, the national polls were actually a touch better in 2016 than in 2012. Four years ago, the final RCP National Average gave President Obama a 0.7-point lead; he won by 3.9 points, for an error of 3.2 points. The final RCP Four-Way National Poll Average showed Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote by 3.3 points. She will probably win the popular vote by a point or so, which would equate to an error of around two points. … What occurred wasn’t a failure of the polls. As with Brexit, it was a failure of punditry.  Pundits saw Clinton with a 1.9 percent lead in Pennsylvania and assumed she would win. The correct interpretation was that, if Clinton’s actual vote share were just one point lower and Trump’s just one point higher, Trump would be tied or even a bit ahead. So, in other words, if pundits had paid closer attention to the polling and the political science, they would have done better. The 2016 election was unusual in many ways, but in terms of predicting the outcome, this was the way in which it was particularly unusual: This gap absolutely merits further analysis. If there’s a failing in political science models, it’s that this is the second time in the past five presidential election cycles that the popular vote and the electoral college don’t match up. The implicit assumption in the political science models is that those two should correlate almost perfectly. Clearly, they might not. Given his ax, Blakely wants to be angry at political science. The problem is that he’s actually angry at the prediction sites such as the Upshot and the Princeton Election Consortium that radically underestimated Trump’s chances of victory. Given the outcome, those are fair targets. But they’re not political science targets. Blakely needs better aim with his ax."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":582,"title":"Scary Science: How Your Body Responds to Fear","class":1,"body":"For many people, fall is the spooky season. Daylight wanes as nights become longer, a chill touches the air, and trees lose their leaves and take on a skeletal silhouette. If that alone doesn't make you uneasy, Halloween's approach triggers an outpouring of decorations and costumes that embrace the macabre: jack-o'-lanterns with evil grins; skulls and bones; crumbling gravestones; bloodthirsty vampires; and shambling, rotted corpses lurching toward an impending zombie apocalypse. It's enough to send shivers down your spine. But why do certain things frighten us, and what can science tell us about what happens in our bodies when we're afraid? [The Anatomy of Fear (Infographic)] Cultural influences can lead people to be fearful of certain things, such as black cats or killer clowns. But there are also universal triggers of fear, according to neuropsychiatrist Dr. Katherine Brownlowe, chief of the Division of Neurobehavioral Health at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Typically, those are things that are going to make you die, Brownlowe told Live Science. Heights, animals, lightning, spiders, somebody running after you in a dark alley — generally, people have some kind of fear response to those kinds of things, she said. Fear is, first and foremost, a survival mechanism. When the senses detect a source of stress that might pose a threat, the brain activates a cascade of reactions that prime us either to battle for our lives or to escape as quickly as possible — a reaction in mammals that is known as the fight-or-flight response. Fear is regulated by a part of the brain within the temporal lobes known as the amygdala, Brownlowe told Live Science. When stress activates the amygdala, it temporarily overrides conscious thought so that the body can divert all of its energy to facing the threat — whatever that might be. The release of neurochemicals and hormones causes an increase in heart rate and breathing, shunts blood away from the intestines and sends more to the muscles, for running or fighting, Brownlowe explained. It puts all the brain's attention into 'fight-or-flight.' Fluff, freeze, focus Some of our bodies' responses to mortal terror are throwbacks to mechanisms that served our ancient ancestors, though these responses aren't as useful to us anymore. When fear raises goose bumps on our skin, it makes the hair on our arms stand up — which doesn't seem to help us either fight an enemy or escape from one. But when our early human ancestors were covered with hair, fluffing it up could have made them look bigger and more imposing, Brownlowe said. Freezing in place like a deer caught in a car's headlights is another frequent response to being scared, and Brownlowe noted that this behavior is commonly seen in animals that are preyed upon. If you freeze, then the predator is less likely to see you and pay attention to you — and, hopefully, less likely to eat you, she said. The emotional response that we feel when we're afraid serves a purpose, as well — it heightens alertness, keeping the body and brain focused on staying safe until the threat is neutralized. Even babies can be fearful of things such as loud noises, sudden movements and unfamiliar faces, and young children may be terrified of things that adults know aren't real — like a monster hiding under the bed or a boogeyman in the closet. It isn't until kids reach age 7 or so that they can differentiate between real-world threats and threats that live only in their imaginations, Brownlowe said. [Goblin Sharks and 'Skeletorus': 6 Scary Beasts to Haunt Your Halloween] Facing our fears What makes humans' responses to fear different from other animals' is that people can process that fear and tamp it down once they consciously understand that they are not really in danger. We can get startled, but instead of running away like bunny rabbits, we reassess the situation and figure out that we don't need to respond in a 'fight-or-flight' manner, Brownlowe said. And then we can just get on with our day. Some people even deliberately seek out the experience of being frightened — they watch horror movies, brave the terrifying drop of towering roller coasters and do whatever generates a feeling of immediate personal risk. According to Brownlowe, they're enjoying the chemical aftermath that follows a rush of fear — a feeling that can be euphoric. Once the 'fight-or-flight' signals cease, the brain releases neurotransmitters and hormones that mediate what we call the 'rest-and-digest' system, Brownlowe said. The heart rate is coming down, the breathing is slowing, goose bumps are relaxing. There's a sense of internal cognitive relief in the body, and that feels good. The modern world comes with a number of stresses that early humans never faced and never could have imagined — financial burdens, performance anxieties, and a number of other social pressures that can generate fear and crushing anxiety. A good old-fashioned scare can make some of the everyday fears we face seem less terrifying, Brownlowe added. It gives people perspective, she said. If you're anxious about talking to your boss about getting a raise and then you get the crap scared out of you, talking to your boss is no big deal."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":583,"title":"A switch to daylight saving time could be lifesaving for koalas, researchers say","class":1,"body":"The population of wild koalas in the southeast portion of Australia’s Queensland state has plunged by 80% in less than two decades, but researchers are offering a simple plan to save them. They can sum it up in three words: daylight saving time. Changing the clocks would help stem the koalapocalypse by reducing fatal encounters between koalas and the motorists who drive through their ever-shrinking territory, the researchers say. According to their calculations, the number of koala deaths could fall by 8% on weekdays and 11% on weekends. We hope that our study will encourage the Queensland government to consider the benefits of implementing DST, they wrote in a study published Tuesday in the journal Biology Letters. Queensland, the state in the northeastern corner of Australia, has a complicated relationship with daylight saving time. The practice has not been observed there since 3 a.m. on March 1, 1992, when a three-year trial period came to an end. The push to bring it back has spawned petitions, referendums and even a political party (Daylight Saving for South-East Queensland, or DS4SEQ). To the study authors, the main benefit of daylight saving time is that it would result in having fewer cars on the road during and after twilight. That’s when koalas – nocturnal animals that sleep during the day and are active at night – are most likely to be on the ground near roads, or attempting to cross them. The researchers examined traffic flow data from the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads to gauge when thoroughfares around Brisbane had the most motorists. Weekday traffic was highest between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m., and again between 3 p.m. and about 6 p.m., corresponding with commuting times. On weekends, traffic was heaviest between 11 a.m. and noon, then remained relatively high until about 4 p.m. But some of these high-traffic periods were deadlier than others. By far, the most wildlife-vehicle collisions occurred during the first few hours of evening darkness. During the darker months, that window began a little after 5 p.m.; during the lighter months, it started closer to 7 p.m. The researchers also put satellite tracking collars on 25 koalas to see where they were at various hours of the day. Just as with cars, they found that koala activity peaked in the late afternoon/early evening period, according to the study. The clear implication is that policies to reduce this overlap might reduce collision rates, the researchers wrote. On weekdays, giving drivers an extra hour of daylight for their evening commute would reduce the number of koala strikes by 8.1% to 8.6%, depending on the road. On weekends, the later twilight would mean 10.5% to 11.3% fewer collisions, the team determined. (The researchers think the benefit would be smaller on weekdays because some of the gains in the evening would be offset a bit by darkness during the morning commute.) The findings don’t necessarily apply to other parts of Australia, where traffic patterns may be different than in Brisbane and where adoption of daylight saving time would mean different amounts of evening daylight. The researchers also noted that koalas might be affected differently than other wildlife species that are vulnerable to traffic. Still, policymakers ought to at least consider koalas and other wildlife when contemplating a return to daylight saving time, they wrote."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":584,"title":"Scientists Say Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Made Earth's Surface Act Like Liquid","class":1,"body":"When the asteroid believed to have killed off the dinosaurs smashed into Earth some 66 million years ago, its sheer force made the planet's surface momentarily act like a liquid. The asteroid ripped open a 60-mile-wide hole. From miles deep in that abyss, rock hurtled upward to a height twice that of Mount Everest and then collapsed outward to form a ring of mountains. And it all happened within 5 minutes — 10 tops, as Sean Gulick, a geophysicist at the University of Texas, Austin, tells The Two-Way. Gulick helped lead a team of researchers that drilled for samples of that mountain ring in the Chicxulub crater off the coast of Mexico earlier this year. Their initial findings were recently published in the journal Science. He says these samples immediately settled a major debate about how a planet's surface behaves during an asteroid impact — and how the mountain ring, known as a peak ring, is formed. Some researchers have argued that the process is dominated by melting on the surface, which would mean that the ring is mainly formed from material moving from side-to-side. So things collapse in from the sides, fairly shallow, and in that model this ring of peaks are created by shallow material kind of moving towards the center and being uplifted, he says. Others have suggested that it was a much more dramatic kind of movement, involving the fluid-like propelling of material from deep within the Earth's crust. Gulick says there was a very clear moment during the expedition when the team knew this theory was correct. It was just so obvious, even on the drill floor when we're out there, out in our hard hats and so on, looking at these cores coming up, Gulick says. The researchers were seeing pink granite that is typically found deeper within the Earth — and not the limestone that would have been on the surface during the Cretaceous Period. And it was just plain as day, he says, and everybody staring at it went, 'Wow, there's the answer. It's from deep.'  Gulick likens the rapid process to what happens when you toss a rock into a pond: It makes a hole initially as the rock penetrates into the pond. And the sides will sort of collapse inward toward the hole while the center kind of rebounds up like a big water droplet rising up. If you picture all of this happening in a slightly slower-moving fluid than water would be, you can envision that the center that rebounds upwards and splashes upwards would kind of collapse outwards. So just as the sides are falling in, this rebounding center is sort of collapsing outwards to create ... this ring of mountains, made from material that ultimately came from fairly deep. It's worth noting that even though the rock behaved like liquid, Gulick says it remained solid. However, the materials were either shocked or damaged so much that they're able to temporarily lose their cohesion and move like a slow-moving fluid. Big questions remain about how that physical process actually works, he says. The pink granite that emerged from about 6 miles deep in the Earth might provide hints about how life came back to ground zero after the asteroid's impact erased most of the species on the planet. The rock is completely shot through with fractures and faults, and is much more porous and less dense than typical granite, Gulick says. Those nooks and crannies could have provided a habitat for microbial life. He says the pore spaces and the hot fluids and the interesting chemistry that takes place in the wake of an impact could be hospitable to these microscopic creatures. Gulick's team thinks the fluid-like movement is probably the right way to think about impact processes on the moon or on crater-laden planets such as Mercury or Venus. And he says that if we're looking for evidence of life on other planets, these findings indicate that crater sites would be a good place to start."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":585,"title":"Scientists to 'reset' blood proteins in attempt to slow ageing process","class":1,"body":"Trial will attempt to change levels of proteins in older blood, believed to hamper growth and maintenance of healthy tissues In what could be a fresh chapter in the never-ending story of the search for eternal youth, scientists are to tinker with people’s blood in the hope of slowing down the ageing process and preventing age-related diseases. Researchers in California plan to launch a clinical trial of the radical – and highly experimental – approach in the next six months, after a small study in mice found the treatment had promise. People who take part in the trial will have their blood passed through a machine that resets abnormal levels of proteins seen in older blood. The scientists believe these high levels of certain proteins can hamper the growth and maintenance of healthy body tissues, and so contribute to their deterioration in old age. Plans for the trial emerged as scientists announced the results of the animal study, which was part-funded by Calico, Google’s life extension company. The study showed that infusions of old blood reduced the growth of fresh liver and brain cells in young mice and impaired their performance in a strength test. The same series of experiments found evidence that infusions of young blood could speed up muscle repair in older animals. But Irina Conboy, who led the work at the University of California, Berkeley, said the improvement could be due the dilution of old blood in the animals, rather than the young blood having rejuvenating properties itself. The work is the latest in a string of studies to show that molecules in blood may shift the apparent pace of ageing in various bodily tissues. But while much of the previous work has focused on the rejuvenating effects of proteins lurking in young blood, the Berkeley team conclude that abnormal levels of proteins in old blood are more important. These proteins are made by all the tissues in your body every day, Conboy told the Guardian. When they are present at low levels, they are important, and you cannot live without them. But with ageing their levels become skewed. Some of them go up, and some go down. So the rational approach is not to give people young blood, but to normalise the levels of these key molecules. Asked about her hopes for a treatment, Conboy said, If you can prevent Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and type 2 diabetes, you pretty much provide many more decades of healthy active life to everybody. One scientist who read the study was not convinced by the findings. Tony Wyss-Coray at Stanford University has set up a clinical trial to investigate whether injections of young blood plasma can help people with early stage Alzheimer’s disease. He said he doubted the results because of the statistics the team use, and the fact that the studies draw on only four pairs of mice for each experiment. In the past, scientists have investigated what happens when blood is swapped between old and young animals by conjoining them in a surgical operation known as parabiosis. Because the animals share a blood supply, the procedure allows scientists to look for effects of young blood on old animals and vice versa. But mice that are conjoined in this way share more than a blood supply. For example, an older mouse attached to a younger one benefits from the latter’s more youthful organs too. In the latest study, reported in Nature Communications, Conboy’s team came up with a new way to transfer blood between animals without conjoining them. Instead of surgically attaching the animals, their blood is drawn through a tube by a computer-controlled pump and directly transfused into the recipient animal. The Berkeley team is now working on a device that can filter out high levels of proteins from old human blood and so reset them to more youthful levels. If you can remove key inhibitor molecules from the blood of an old person and then return that blood into them, that could be immediately therapeutic, Conboy said. We are developing ideas for clinical trials to see what happens if you normalise levels of one key protein we think is inhibitory, she added. We hope to start in six months and have results in three years. Right now our health declines after about seven decades. We are pretty much hoping to extend the productive plateau, where you’re not necessarily the world champion in swimming or running marathons, but you can continue for a few more decades without any critical illnesses."}

But for kids that bear a striking resemblance to the straw-haired mischiefmaker (above), tangled hair is no fault of their own: It’s due to a rare genetic mutation. Scientists have now pinpointed the three genes that cause so-called uncombable hair syndrome, a hair shaft disorder characterized by dry, frizzy, pale hair that—like the name says—is impossible to comb flat. To indisputably diagnose the condition, hairs are split in half and placed under a high-powered scanning electron microscope. Straight hair appears round, curly hair appears oblique, but uncombable hair is triangular or heart-shaped at the cross section and grooved from root to end. Three genes—PADI3, TGM3, and TCHH—direct the process that causes the misshaped strands, researchers report this month in the American Journal of Human Genetics. If just one of these genes malfunctions, the structure and stability of the hair is affected. Only about 100 cases have ever been reported, though the researchers suspect not all sufferers are reporting their symptoms. Think about it: When was the last time you visited your doctor because of a bad hair day? Fortunately for patients, the snarls seem to become more manageable with age, and the syndrome does not have health implications beyond tangled tresses. As for everyone else, at least you can rest easy knowing your kid’s knots probably aren’t caused by flawed genes."}

The Family Science Night effort is facilitated by Prosper Waco and is part of the museum’s goal to help students improve State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness scores at two of Waco ISD’s underperforming campuses, Mayborn Museum officials said. The schools, Brook Avenue Elementary School and West Avenue Elementary School, haven’t earned the academic achievement distinction for science and math in the past few years, according to Texas Education Agency documents. The Family Science Night was the first of its kind in Waco, Mayborn education facilitator Anna McKay said. Science is one of the main subject areas at these particular schools where students are not scoring and meeting those expectations. If we can spark that learning through the activity in the room, then hopefully they can meet those test scores. Prosper Waco is a collective impact group focused on education, health and financial security in the city and develops community partnerships to bridge gaps in those areas. One of the ways we use data is to specifically target the campuses to see a larger impact, and it definitely falls in line with our school readiness goal, Prosper Waco spokeswoman Christina Helmick said. But it tells a bigger story with the family engagement piece. When Prosper Waco first started, the community identified family engagement as a goal, but how do you measure family engagement? So, we’re working on including that family engagement into efforts, and Family Science Night is a perfect example of that. About 350 people participated in the first Family Science Night last month, McKay said. The museum is in the process of planning more nights for the spring semester to help the two campuses, said Rebecca Tucker Nall, assistant director of exhibits, communication and visitor services. The event could eventually expand to other underperforming schools in other local districts, Tucker Nall said. You spend most of your life outside the classroom, she said. At museums, we’re informal education centers and we want to encourage lifelong learning and encourage learning outside the classroom, so it makes learning fun when you’re in the classroom as well. Facilitators and volunteers come in to show students engaging science activities. The first Family Science Night let kids make a tornado in a bottle and design a Happy City using recycled material. Students were asked what kind of buildings were needed in a Happy City. They built buildings out of cardboard and paper, including a Harry Potter and Scooby-Doo Museum and more standard elements, including hospitals and animal shelters. Students and parents could also go to interactive elements throughout the museum. One let them examine animal skeletons.We engage the parents, by just bringing out that inner-child first of all, but also encouraging learning in the science area as well, McKay said. We had many parents say what a blast they had that night, and there were just smiles all around. The staff felt just very fulfilled as well. Though a date hasn’t been set for the next Family Science Night, McKay said like the first one, the event will be free for families. Information on the next event will be released through school officials or www.baylor.edu/mayborn."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":588,"title":"Global Warming Alters Arctic Food Chain, Scientists Say, With Unforeseeable Results","class":1,"body":"The Arctic Ocean may seem remote and forbidding, but to birds, whales and other animals, it’s a top-notch dining destination. It’s a great place to get food in the summertime, so animals are flying or swimming thousands of miles to get there, said Kevin R. Arrigo, a biological oceanographer at Stanford University. But the menu is changing. Confirming earlier research, scientists reported Wednesday that global warming is altering the ecology of the Arctic Ocean on a huge scale. The annual production of algae, the base of the food web, increased an estimated 47 percent between 1997 and 2015, and the ocean is greening up much earlier each year. These changes are likely to have a profound impact for animals further up the food chain, such as birds, seals, polar bears and whales. But scientists still don’t know enough about the biology of the Arctic Ocean to predict what the ecosystem will look like in decades to come. While global warming has affected the whole planet in recent decades, nowhere has been hit harder than the Arctic. This month, temperatures in the high Arctic have been as much as 36 degrees above average, according to records kept by the Danish Meteorological Institute. In October, the extent of sea ice was 28.5 percent below average — the lowest for the month since scientists began keeping records in 1979. The area of missing ice is the size of Alaska and Texas put together. Since the mid-2000s, researchers like Dr. Arrigo have been trying to assess the effects of retreating ice on the Arctic ecosystem. The sun returns to the Arctic each spring and melts some of the ice that formed in winter. Algae in the open water quickly spring to life and start growing. These algae are the base of the food chain in the Arctic Ocean, grazed by krill and other invertebrates that in turn support bigger fish, mammals and birds. Dr. Arrigo and his colleagues visited the Arctic in research ships to examine algae in the water and to determine how it affected the water’s color. They then reviewed satellite images of the Arctic Ocean, relying on the color of the water to estimate how much algae was growing — what scientists call the ocean’s productivity. The sea’s productivity was rapidly increasing, Dr. Arrigo found. Last year he and his colleagues published their latest update, estimating that the productivity of the Arctic rose 30 percent between 1998 and 2012."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":589,"title":"Overly Cautious and Unscientific","class":1,"body":"Like many of my fellow researchers, for some years, I have observed the diminishing importance given to scientific facts, opening wide the information market to scaremongering. As an expert in plant biotechnology, I have become—involuntarily—well-trained in uncovering false science and claims distorted by ideology. Since the first cargo of genetically modified soybeans was delivered to the European continent in 1996, European scientists have continuously come under fire from an inseparable triad: activists at war with the industrial society, the media fond of fearmongering, and the dark side of the internet. Well-funded activist groups have now extended their war against GMOs to the U.S. As in Europe, they initiated their campaign with their right to know slogan, while their real goal is to destroy a technology. As a consequence, it becomes almost impossible for an ordinary citizen to distinguish truth from lies. The European experience shows us that after GMOs, the same scare tactics are used against other technologies (nanotechnologies, electromagnetic radiation, etc.). As a consequence, it becomes almost impossible for an ordinary citizen to distinguish truth from lies. (And I consider myself to be an ordinary citizen for the many scientific fields in which I am not an expert.) To help understand what is happening, I suggest the following classification of false sciences. At the bottom of the scale, we have (classical) pseudoscience, such as astrology, paranormal, unscientific medicines, etc. supported by an ancient community of believers. Generally, they do not attempt to undermine the foundation of science. A second category is what the French historian Alexander Moatti termed altersciences, mainly represented by individuals who have received scientific training and who use their knowledge to promote alternative theories or rebuild their own discipline. Even when alone against the rest of the scientific world, an alterscientist will claim he or she is right and seek recognition elsewhere, usually in the media. Moatti showed that this phenomenon has existed for centuries. Now, via the internet, an alterscientist can become an international hero. There are many recent examples of this in the activism against vaccines or chemicals. A third category is what I call parallel science, which is often used to serve a political project. Parallel science is what the tobacco industry used. Similarly, when the results of science are seen as a threat by the advocates of a political project, they may be tempted to create or invent their own science to create the evidence that suits them. Parallel science is aided by fake research centers (claiming to be independent), colloquia with predetermined conclusions, scientific journals devoted to the cause—today, it is very easy to create a pseudoscientific journal on the internet—and occasionally heterodox publications passing through the sieve of true scientific journals (and which will be given wide publicity). All combine to create, for the nonspecialist, the appearance of science. False science, but real ballyhoo! It would be wrong to believe that these phenomena only exist outside official institutions. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, a specialized agency of the World Health Organization, has exhibited questionable behavior. For example, IARC publishes a classification of substances, food, and occupational exposures into five categories ranging from carcinogenic for humans to probably not carcinogenic for humans. Red meat is classified as probably carcinogenic, which is absurd if one does not take into account the amount eaten on a regular basis: Indeed an excess can be deleterious, but reasonable consumption of meat is beneficial to health. On the IARC website, one can actually read (highlighted in bold) that this classification does not measure the likelihood that cancer will occur (technically called ‘risk’) as a result of exposure to the agent. Strangely, the expert working group at IARC did not attach this warning to its classification of the herbicide glyphosate as probably carcinogenic. Glyphosate is in the same boat as red meat—its carcinogenicity depends entirely on the dose. At the levels used, the carcinogenicity of glyphosate has been refuted by the European Food Safety Authority, but rather than trying to explain the difference between what a substance can do and what it actually does—which could have been a way out of polemics for IARC—some of its officials preferred to formulate accusations against the EFSA. (There are details about the exchange of letters on the EFSA website.) Today, many other scientific organizations (including another WHO organization) have contradicted IARC’s position on glyphosate. Moreover, suspicions of (ideological) bias have surfaced against an editor of the report and other IARC officials. That IARC advised its experts not to disclose documents that were requested under U.S. freedom of information laws is doing little to build trust in its work. Nevertheless, glyphosate use has been banned in some countries; it is still under the threat of a ban in the European Union. The latter has made non-science-based precautions a kind of new religion. If a corporation was insisting on such false claims to be made without scientific evidence, there would be outrage. But because the political power of this precautionary approach is stronger, the unscientific process is accepted. As can be seen, we are far from a knowledge-based society, a concept coined by some international organizations (such as the Organization of American States) and ... the European Union! The debate on the best way to protect science from ideological (or corporate) interference and how to share scientific knowledge deserves to be open. In the IARC/glyphosate case, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has asked a good question—namely whether taxpayers’ money has been wasted on IARC. Why do I feel I already know the answer."}

The launch is set for April 2021 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The satellite will ride atop one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets. The specific launch contract amount was not disclosed; it is considered competition and procurement sensitive information, NASA said. The total cost for NASA to launch the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission is about $112 million, which includes the launch service and spacecraft processing as well as other additional support beyond the SpaceX service. In a statement, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the company was excited to carry this critical science payload into orbit. We appreciate NASA’s partnership and confidence in SpaceX as a launch provider, she said. The mission adds to the list of NASA contracts won by SpaceX. In 2014, SpaceX was awarded a $3.1-billion contract with NASA to develop a crew capsule to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. In January, the Hawthorne space company launched NASA’s Jason-3 satellite, which is intended to measure the height of the ocean surface. SpaceX has not launched any rockets since September, when a Falcon 9 rocket and a commercial communications satellite exploded on a launch pad in Florida. An investigation into the cause of the explosion is ongoing, though the company has narrowed its focus to one of three composite overwrapped pressure vessels that store helium in the rocket’s second-stage liquid oxygen tank. Earlier this month, SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said the company could resume launches in December."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":591,"title":"Cement soaks up greenhouse gases","class":1,"body":"Cement is a climate villain. Making it is thought to produce 5% of all global greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and factories. But this building block of modern civilization may eventually suck some of that carbon dioxide (CO2) back up—enough to cancel nearly a quarter of the gases released making cement, according to a new study. To make cement, limestone (calcium carbonate) is turned into lime (calcium oxide) by baking it at temperatures topping 1000°C. That conversion releases copious amounts of CO2—half cement’s total greenhouse gases. The other half comes from fossil fuels used to heat cement kilns. But there’s a silver lining: The mortar, concrete, and rubble from demolished buildings can gradually absorb CO2 through a process called carbonation. As CO2 from the air enters tiny pores in the cement, it encounters a variety of chemicals and water trapped there. The ensuing reactions convert the CO2 into other chemicals, including water. Still, just how much CO2 the world’s cement soaked up had never been estimated. So a team of Chinese scientists, including physicist Zhu Liu, now at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, set out to do just that. Those researchers eventually teamed up with Steve Davis, an earth systems scientist at the University of California, Irvine, and other U.S. and European researchers. Together, they compiled data from studies of how cement is used around the world, including the thickness of concrete walls, the quality of concrete used in different structures, the life spans of concrete buildings, and what happens to the concrete after the buildings are torn down. The scientists also visited construction sites around China—the world’s largest producer of cement—to get more accurate estimates of a variety of factors that influence how much CO2 the cement absorbs. That included everything from the size range of concrete rubble and how long it was left in the open air, to how much cement was used in thick concrete versus thin layers of mortar spread on walls, where it’s exposed more readily to CO2. Then they took things to the laboratory. Here, they calculated the carbonation rate in mortar and concrete in different settings—buried, in the open air, and enclosed in a room. The information formed the underpinnings of a computer model that the scientists ran 100,000 times to see how the final estimates changed as different variables were tweaked. The results cast a different light on the cumulative impact cement has on the climate. The researchers estimate that between 1930 and 2013, cement has soaked up 4.5 gigatons of carbon or more than 16 gigatons of CO2, 43% of the total carbon emitted when limestone was converted to lime in cement kilns, they report online today in Nature Geoscience. That’s more than 20% of the carbon soaked up by forests in recent decades, they write. The findings don’t represent a dramatic change in the overall picture of greenhouse gas emissions, says Rob Jackson, an earth systems scientist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, and chairman of the Global Carbon Project, a consortium of researchers that tracks the planet’s carbon. But, he says, it adds another piece of information to the part of carbon models that is particularly prone to uncertainty—how much carbon is soaked up on land. In future inventories, cement will need to be added to the list of things that absorb carbon from the atmosphere. It’s important, Jackson says. It’s an opportunity to improve what we know. Because cement effectively cancels part of its impact over time, the results might also help guide strategies for reducing its carbon footprint. Bigger gains could come from shifting away from fossil fuels to make the cement, Davis says. If you have a choice—reduce fossil emissions or reduce cement emissions—you should prefer the fossil ones right now. It’s conceivable, he says, that in the future cement could even suck up more CO2 than it produces. But that, he says, would take switching away from fossil fuels, and finding a way to capture and dispose of the gases coming from the limestone at cement factories."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":592,"title":"This rocket engine breaks a law of physics. But a NASA test says it works anyway.","class":1,"body":"NASA scientists have been daydreaming about a new kind of rocket engine that could carry astronauts to Mars in 70 days without burning any fuel. Now, in a new paper published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Propulsion and Power, they say that it might really work. The paper, written by astrophysicists at NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories, tested a electromagnetic propulsion system, or EM drive, that generates a small amount of thrust simply by bouncing microwaves around a cone-shaped copper chamber. No propellant goes in, no exhaust comes out, and yet, somehow, the engine can make things move. If you think that news sounds too good to be true, you've got good instincts — it just might be. This impossible fuel-less engine appears to violate one of the fundamental laws of physics. Say what? Hark back to your high school science classroom. Avert your eyes from the unfortunate hair styles and acne, if necessary, and try to focus on what's written on the blackboard: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. That's Newton's third law of motion. It's the principle that explains why pushing against a wall will send an ice skater zooming in the opposite direction. It also explains how jet engines work: As hot gases are expelled out the back of the plane, they produce a thrusting force that moves the plane forward. But the EM drive doesn't work that way. Its thrust seems to come from the impact of photons on the walls of the copper cavity. That would be like moving a car forward by just banging against the windshield. And that works? According to the new paper, yes. The Eagleworks scientists report that their machine generated 1.2 millinewtons of thrust per kilowatt of electricity pumped in. (That electricity could come from solar panels in a hypothetical spaceship.) That's a fraction of thrust produced by the lightweight ion drives now used in many NASA spacecraft, National Geographic noted, but it's a lot more than the few micronewtons per kilowatt produced by light sails, a proven technology that generates thrust using radiation from the sun. Where did this idea come from? The idea for an EM drive was first published a decade ago by British engineer Roger Shawyer. He argued that the drive isn't really reactionless — instead, he argued, the thrust comes from radiation pressure. Microwaves inside the cavity create an imbalance of radiation that pushes against the walls and generates thrust. The idea was hyped in headlines and splashed across the cover of New Scientist magazine, but most scientists were, and still are, extremely skeptical. There's no theoretical explanation for how such an engine might work, and not all the possible sources of experimental error have been eliminated. A team of scientists at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University have been working to build their own EM drive, but their one positive result turned out to be a measurement error, according to the Christian Science Monitor. In 2014, independent inventor and chemical engineer Guido Fetta got the scientists at Eagleworks to evaluate his variation on the EM drive, which he calls Cannae. They concluded that it did produce a small amount of thrust, but didn't speculate on what that might mean or what mysterious new laws of physics could have produced it. Fetta says he now wants to test the drive in space, according to Popular Mechanics. NASA has been uncharacteristically restrained about this whole project. When asked about the Eagleworks experiments last year, the space agency told Space.com, While conceptual research into novel propulsion methods by a team at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston has created headlines, this is a small effort that has not yet shown any tangible results. NASA is not working on 'warp drive' technology. What does this new paper really mean? The new finding does lend some credence to EM drive claims. It passed peer review, which means that several expert scientists reviewed the methodology and the results and found no major flaws. It also addressed one of the major knocks against past EM drive tests — that the engines heat up when activated, suggesting that hot air around the machines, rather than the photons inside them, might be what generates thrust. The Eagleworks scientists made sure this wasn't the case by conducting their test in a vacuum. This doesn't mean that the Eagleworks EM drive definitely functions. Peer review is designed to make sure that studies are well designed and executed, and that the conclusions are reasonable — it's not an endorsement. And plenty of findings published in solid scientific papers have later been found to be incomplete or incorrect. That's how science is supposed to work: You draw conclusions based on the best evidence available, present them to your peers, and revise and refine as you conduct more tests and gather more data. The authors of the paper list nine possible sources of error in their experiment, and indicate that they need to do more tests to try to rule those out. The issue involved here is whether the experiment is seeing something real or not, Jim Woodward, a physicist at California State at Fullerton, told Motherboard. I know [co-author Paul March] does clean work and, to be honest, I suspect there may really be something there. But, Woodward added, there's no theoretical explanation for the phenomenon that March and his colleagues report. That's not necessarily disqualifying — evidence is evidence — but it is a good reason to stop and take a second look. The result they're seeing can't actually be explained in terms of the theory they're proposing, he said. So the question is: What is causing it? Yeah, what he said! This National Geographic piece does a great job walking through some of the proposed physics explanations for how the EM drive could generate thrust (if it in fact does). The Eagleworks scientists propose that the microwave photons are pushing against something called quantum vacuum virtual plasma — something that hasn't been proven to exist. Physicist Mike McCullough of the University of Plymouth has proposed a new (also unproven) kind of radiation experienced by accelerating objects could be at work. The phenomenon might be evidence of a hypothesis developed by Woodward, called the Mach effect, in which the energy generated by the accelerating body is actually stored within the body. Or, it's possible that this whole idea is poppycock, a dead-end project fueled by fantasy and just enough evidence to convince scientists that they should keep going. That would be nothing new. Isaac Newton himself was a dyed-in-the-wool alchemist who wasted years trying to turn lead into gold. The allure of achieving the impossible is incredibly powerful, and not even the best scientists in history are immune. It's too soon to make a call either way about EM drives. But the Eagleworks paper will likely provide a tiny nudge toward credibility. Writing in Forbes, astrophysicist Brian Koberlein said, Even as a skeptic I have to admit the work is valid research. This is how science is done if you want to get it right. Do experiments, submit them to peer review, get feedback, and reevaluate. For their next trick the researchers would like to try the experiment in space. I admit that’s an experiment I’d like to see."}

The first manned expedition may fly to Mars as part of international cooperation in 2040-2050, Head of the Space Gamma-Spectroscopy Laboratory of Russia’s Space Research Institute, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences Igor Mitrofanov told TASS on Tuesday. A manned expedition to Mars is not an easy task. In my estimate, technically we’ll be able to implement it approximately in 2040-2050. This Martian expedition will most probably be performed on the basis of consolidated international efforts, he said. The space vehicles that can be made today do not have the required speed for such a mission, the researcher said. A flight to Mars aboard a modern spacecraft must continue for quite a long time, for about half a year and the radiation doze received by the crew may considerably exceed permissible levels, the scientist said. At the same time, it is irrational to create a big spaceship with powerful radiation protection. Instead of this, it is simply necessary to fly to the Red Planet quicker, within weeks rather than months, he noted. In case of a quick flight, it is possible to choose the period of the relatively calm Sun [the basic source of radiation] while the accumulated doze from galactic space rays will be quite permissible, he explained. However, a Martian spacecraft needs nuclear-powered rocket engines to develop great speed and this requires new developments and considerable financial costs, Mitrofanov said. Also, infrastructure should be prepared on Mars before the arrival of the expedition, including a manned module with radiation protection in the form of at least a meter-thick soil layer, he added. Scientists are planning to test the elements of a future Martian expedition within the framework of Russia’s manned lunar program, which is expected to be carried out after 2030."}

Researchers from the University of Lincoln and Lancaster University set themselves the task of working this out, having decided that since 90 percent of the population uses one type of phone or the other and that this might help to pigeonhole people. There is good news if you are a young lady and use an iPhone, because that is what you are supposed to be doing. Likewise if you are an old man and use Android, because again, that is what science has decided might be right. Android and iPhone devices account for over 90 percent of all smartphones sold worldwide. Despite being very similar in functionality, current discourse and marketing campaigns suggest that key individual differences exist between users of these two devices; however, this has never been investigated empirically, said the researchers by way of introduction. This is surprising, as smartphones continue to gain momentum across a variety of research disciplines. In this article, we consider if individual differences exist between these two distinct groups. The differences often show themselves in the pub when people can get a bit competitive about their choice of handset, although in most adult conversations it doesn't actually come up that often. In comparison to Android users, we found that iPhone owners are more likely to be female, younger, and increasingly concerned about their smartphone being viewed as a status object, explain the scientific minds. Key differences in personality were also observed with iPhone users displaying lower levels of Honesty-Humility and higher levels of emotionality. We are not scientists here or psychologists, but we do use mobile phones.

{"id":595,"title":"'Singing Snake' Busted: Real Voice Behind Legend Discovered","class":1,"body":"Local folklore in the Amazon region and in parts of Central America claims that the bushmaster — a giant and deadly viper — can sing. The breathy, repetitive notes of this call are associated with the venomous snake, and they instill fear in people living in the northwestern Amazon River basin, researchers have reported. But scientists recently discovered who was really doing the singing. In fact, more than one vocalist is responsible. The song attributed to the bushmaster turned out to belong to two types of tree frog: the little-known species Tepuihyla tuberculosa and a new species, Tepuihyla shushupe, whose name shushupe comes from the local term for the so-called singing snake. [40 Freaky Frog Photos] The scientists were researching frog populations in Ecuador and Peru when they learned of the alleged singing ability of the viper Lachesis muta from their field assistants, the researchers wrote in a new study. Ironically, the second part of the snake's scientific name, muta, means voiceless. But when the researchers investigated the sound identified by others as the viper's call, they instead tracked the call to two frog species. The researchers heard and analyzed a number of calls and obtained one T. shushupe individual, an adult male, in Peru's Putumayo River basin, close to the border shared with Colombia. From the calling behavior — which emanated from tree holes — the scientists interpreted that the frog lived in the canopy and descended into tree holes to breed. T. shushupe and T. tuberculosa bothmeasure about 3 inches (85 millimeters) in length, which is large for this genus. Tepuihyla frogs typically reach about 2 inches (59 mm) in length. The study authors described the frogs' call as a cackle of short notes repeated at a fast rate, with the amplitude and speed of the call building up during the first half and then decreasing toward the end. So much for the local legends about the bushmaster's vocal prowess. However, some serpents can produce other types of unexpected noises. King cobras are known to growl when agitated, producing the sound by resonating chambers in their tracheas, according to a December 1991 study published in the Journal of Experimental Zoology. And several species of snakes employ a defensive strategy known as cloacal popping — sometimes referred to as microfarts — made by expelling air from a vent in the cloaca, an opening at the rear of the body for the digestive and reproductive tracts. It is unclear why the bushmaster was credited for the frogs' calls, but the researchers noted that the tale of the singing viper was widespread — and not just among people native to the Amazon basin. According to the authors, an earlier study reported that hunters and colonists shared similar stories about the viper's vocal abilities. Perhaps future investigations could get to the bottom of how people came to believe that a snake could sing, the study authors suggested. The findings were published online Nov. 9 in the journal ZooKeys."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":596,"title":"Women Have Always Lived Longer, Study Finds","class":1,"body":"Men still aren't living as long as women — and that holds true for humans' primate cousins as well, a new study shows. In the study, researchers looked at data from six populations of humans from both modern and historical times, in different countries. The investigators found that, in spite of the huge gains in human longevity over the past century, the male-female difference has not shrunk, said Susan Alberts, a professor of biology at Duke University and a co-author of the new study. The researchers did find that the the amount by which women outlived men varied across populations. For instance, the largest male-female difference in life span among the populations studied was in modern-day Russia, where the gap is approximately 10 years. Much smaller differences were found in other populations such as people living in modern-day Nigeria and India. [Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100] Additionally, the scientists found that the gap for nonhuman primates was much smaller than it was for humans. In the study, the researchers looked at the mortality of six different human populations that represented the full range of human experience. The scientists drew information about three generally long-lived populations from a large international database called the Human Mortality Database, including the Swedish population from 1751 to 1759, the Swedish population from 2000 to 2009 and the Japanese population in 2012. The researchers also looked at data from three populations with generally much shorter lives, including two modern hunter-gatherer populations, the Hadza of Tanzania and the Ache of Paraguay, as well as data from a population of freed slaves, who migrated from the U.S. to Liberia between 1820 and 1843. For nonhuman primates, the researchers looked at data collected from six wild populations of sifakas, muriquis, capuchins, gorillas, chimpanzees and baboons, each with a population somewhere between about 400 and 1,500. Finally, the researchers also supplemented their data on humans by looking at smaller data sets from an additional 16 human populations, including people in Russia, China, India, the U.S. and other countries. The study produced three major findings: First, in long-lived populations of humans, such as those of modern-day Japan and Sweden, people's average life spans are fairly consistent, meaning the age of death within populations is fairly similar in different countries: Most deaths in those countries occur when adults are between their late 70s and early 90s. In contrast, other primates' life spans are much shorter and highly variable. Second, the difference in life span between the people living industrial societies and those living in hunter-gatherer societies was greater than the difference between the hunter-gatherers and the nonhuman primates. People living in industrial societies live 30 to 50 years longer than hunter-gatherers, but hunter-gatherers live only 10 to 30 years longer than nonhuman primates, the researchers found. Third, the lives of females tend to be longer and less variable in length than the lives of males, the researchers found. [Wonder Woman: 10 Interesting Facts About the Female Body] In all of the populations, the oldest individuals tended to be females, according to the study. However, for both nonhuman primates and the human populations with shorter life expectancies, the male disadvantage in life span appears to be relatively small. The reason for this difference between males and females still isn't clear, the researchers said. But the existence of this difference in so many different groups of humans, as well as in nonhuman primates, suggests that the disparity has deep evolutionary roots, the researchers wrote in their study. One possible reason for the difference is that men take more risks, Alberts told Live Science. If men's life spans are cut short by risk-taking behavior, it could explain the gap in longevity between men and women, as well as the greater variability in men's age of death as compared to women's, she said. Another possibility is that testosterone plays a role, Alberts said. The higher levels of testosterone found in men may compromise their immune systems, which may affect how long they live, she said. The study had several limitations, such as a relatively small sample size of nonhuman primate populations, the researchers noted. The research was published today (Nov. 21) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":597,"title":"CRISPR gene-editing has been tested in a human for the first time","class":1,"body":"Chinese scientists have become the first in the world to inject an adult human with cells that have been genetically edited using the revolutionary CRISPR/Cas9 technique. The CRISPR-edited cells were injected on October 28 by a team from the Sichuan University in Chengdu, as part of a clinical trial against aggressive lung cancer - and experts think it could trigger a biomedical race between the US and China. If you haven't heard of CRISPR as yet, you soon will. The new gene-editing technique is poised to revolutionise the way we treat disease, by offering scientists a quick and easy way to cut and paste genes from our DNA. CRISPR/Cas9 basically works like a pair of molecular scissors. Researchers just need to program it, and it can cut out certain genes - or add new ones - far more cheaply and quickly than any previous genetic tools. Since the potential of the system was discovered back in 2012, it's already been tested widely in animals, and in January this year, it was used to successfully treat its first disease in mice, Duchenne muscular dystrophy. There have also been CRISPR experiments done in non-viable human embryos, which were never brought to term. But this is the first time that cells edited by CRISPR have ever been injected into an adult human. The trial was carried out at the West China Hospital, and involved a patient with aggressive lung cancer. The researchers extracted the patient's immune cells from a blood sample and then used CRISPR editing to disable a gene in them. The gene that was turned off codes for a protein called PD-1, which usually slows down a cell's immune response, allowing cancer to grow out of control. These PD-1-free immune cells were then cultured in the lab and injected back into the patient. The aim is that they'll now proliferate in the patient's body and attack and destroy cancerous cells. It's still early days, but lead researcher Lu You told David Cyranoski at Nature that the initial treatment went well, and the patient is now ready for a second injection. Across the duration of the trial, which received ethics approval in July, the team aims to treat a total of 10 people, with between two and four injections of genetically edited immune cells each. And they're not the only ones planning to use CRISPR on humans - the US has a similar trial against various cancers in the works, which is scheduled to start in early 2017, and has been funded by Napster billionaire Sean Parker. And China has another three clinical trials planned for March 2017, which will investigate the use of CRISPR against bladder, prostate, and renal-cell cancers - although they're yet to receive funding and ethics approval for those. All this activity leads experts to believe that we're in the midst of a new biomedical race between the US and China - like the space race, but this time the goal is efficient genetic editing. I think this is going to trigger 'Sputnik 2.0', a biomedical duel on progress between China and the United States, Carl June, an immunotherapist from the University of Pennsylvania and a scientific adviser on next year's US CRISPR trial, told Nature. [It's] important since competition usually improves the end product. Other cancer researchers are excited about the progress, although it remains to be seen if  the intensive process of individually removing, editing with CRISPR, and culturing patients' cells will be worth the end result. This first Chinese trial will focus mainly on figuring out how safe the technique is, but hopefully in the coming months we'll also be able to get an idea of whether the technology works or not. Either way, the fact that we're now able to edit people's genes so easily is a huge step forward for personalised medicine. The technology to be able to do this is incredible, Naiyer Rizvi from Columbia University Medical Centre, who wasn't involved in the study, told Nature. The Chinese trial is still in the very early stages, and nothing has been published in a peer-reviewed journal as yet. But we'll be watching the results closely."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":598,"title":"See the first color images produced by an electron microscope","class":1,"body":"Imagine spending your whole life seeing the world in black and white, and then seeing a vase of roses in full color for the first time. That’s kind of what it was like for the scientists who have taken the first multicolor images of cells using an electron microscope. Electron microscopes can magnify an object up to 10 million times, allowing researchers to peer into the inner workings of, say, a cell or a fly’s eye, but until now they’ve only been able to see in black and white. The new advance—15 years in the making—uses three different kinds of rare earth metals called lanthanides (think top row of that extra block below the periodic table) layered one-by-one over cells on a microscope slide. The microscope detects when each metal loses electrons and records each unique loss as an artificial color. So far, the researchers can only produce three colors—red, green, and yellow, they report online today in Cell Chemical Biology. Still, the ability to use color creates stark contrasts that grayscale images simply can’t accomplish. The team could see a string of proteins squeezing through a cell membrane (pictured) in more detail than scientists ever had before, for example. With a few more tweaks and added metal ions, researchers hope to add three or four other colors to the mix and improve the images’ resolution."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":599,"title":"Solar storms can weaken Earth’s magnetic field","class":1,"body":"The sun’s warm glow can sometimes turn menacing. Solar storms can shoot plasma wrapped in bits of the sun’s magnetic field into space, sweeping past Earth and disabling satellites, causing widespread blackouts, and disrupting GPS-based navigation. Now, a new study suggests that one such coronal mass ejection in 2015 temporarily weakened Earth’s protective magnetic field, allowing solar plasma and radiation from the same storm to more easily reach the atmosphere, potentially posing a danger to astronauts. The study also suggests a potential way to predict such storms in the future. On 21 June 2015, a NASA spacecraft called the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory recorded a coronal mass ejection blasting off the sun at roughly 1300 kilometers per second. When the burst reached Earth roughly 40 hours later, its magnetic field was oriented opposite to Earth’s own magnetic field, which caused the fields to be attracted to each other and to interact strongly. It is like bringing two magnets close together, says physicist Sunil Gupta of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, India, and lead author of the new study. The resulting interaction converted magnetic energy into kinetic energy and sent charged particles such as cosmic rays raining down on Earth’s magnetosphere, the region around Earth where its own magnetic field is stronger than other magnetic fields in space. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) rated the geomagnetic storm 4 out of 5 on its scale of storm severity. Radio blackouts were reported, and the aurora borealis was spotted as far south as Texas. Gupta and his team collected data from a telescope in India that measures the number of charged particles called muons that are created as byproducts when cosmic rays hit Earth’s atmosphere. Looking at data from 22 June 2015, they found a statistically significant spike in the number of muons that day. This result was consistent with a weakening of Earth’s magnetic field that allowed cosmic rays to stream more freely through Earth’s magnetnosphere and into the atmosphere without being deflected. The weakening of Earth's magnetic field opens up floodgates for low-energy solar plasma to pour into the atmosphere, says Gupta, whose team reports its findings this month in Physical Review Letters. Overall, the team showed that Earth’s magnetic field is susceptible to temporary damage, rendering our planet’s atmosphere the last line of defense against energetic particles from space. Without Earth’s magnetic field, astronauts above the atmosphere are exposed to particles that can rip through human bodies and damage DNA, potentially causing cancer. The new results also suggest a possible method to detect impending geomagnetic storms. A successful early warning system is key to reducing the economic impact of such storms, which has been estimated by the National Academy of Sciences to be several trillion dollars in the most severe cases. Even with only a few hours of advance warning, power grids could redistribute currents to reduce their vulnerability to currents traveling through Earth and airplanes flying polar routes could be rerouted to avoid losing radio contact with controllers, for example. Gupta and his colleagues propose using muons as early detectors of geomagnetic storms. The scientists begin by assuming that particles with lower energies take longer to travel through turbulent magnetic fields, much like a lazy moth takes longer to cross a windy valley than a quick bee. They accordingly reasoned that the highly energetic cosmic rays creating muons would reach Earth’s atmosphere ahead of the solar plasma and lower-energy cosmic rays that can be the brunt of a geomagnetic storm. The muon burst could in principle serve as an early warning system before a storm, Gupta says. But a lot of research needs to be done to make it a practical proposition. James Chen, a plasma physicist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., says that predicting the future might not be so simple. [The muon burst] is part of an ongoing storm so it may have little forecasting value, he says. The results of Gupta and his team are timely: NOAA issued an alert last week warning of an impending strong geomagnetic storm. However, even when spotted by spacecraft, the predicted arrival times of storms are uncertain because they are based on simulations of how coronal mass ejections propagate through space. An Earth-based early alert system, based on particle data, might give less warning but be significantly more accurate. Earlier this month, U.S. President Barack Obama signed an executive order mandating that the U.S. government mitigate the effects of geomagnetic disturbances on the electrical power grid and ensure the timely redistribution of space weather alerts. Our technological society, for all of its advances, is still susceptible to the whims of our closest star."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":600,"title":"A dinosaur’s brain, preserved in a pebble","class":1,"body":"SALT LAKE CITY—A decade ago, a fossil hunter was combing the beach in southeastern England when he found a strange, brown pebble. The surface of it caught his eye: It was smooth and strangely undulating, and also slightly crinkly in some places. That oddly textured pebble, scientists report here today at the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology meeting, is actually an endocast—an impression preserved in the rock—that represents the first known evidence of fossilized brain tissue of a dinosaur (likely a close relative of Iguanodon, a large, herbivorous type of dinosaur that lived about 133 million years ago). Human brains and bird brains are packed tightly into the brain case, so that their convolutions leave an impression of the inside of the case. But dinosaur (and reptile) brains are more loosely fitted; they are surrounded within the brain case by membranes called meninges, tough sheaths that protect and support the brain. So an endocast of a dinosaur brain might be expected to show those structures—and it did (structures above the green line, above). But beneath them, remineralized in calcium phosphate, the researchers also spied a pattern of tiny capillaries and other cortical tissues—the sort of fabric you’d expect for the cortex of a brain. That those textures were pressed up against the brain case doesn’t necessarily mean that dinosaurs were bigger-brained and smarter than we thought, however: Instead, the dinosaur had likely simply toppled over and been preserved upside down, its brain tissue preserved by surrounding acidic, low-oxygen waters that pickled and hardened the membranes and tissues, providing a template for mineralization. The structure of the brain, studied with scanning electron microscopes, reveal similarities to both birds and crocodiles. It’s the first known evidence of such a dinosaur brain—but now that they know to look for it, the researchers say, they might go back and look at other endocranial casts of dinosaurs to see if they might contain traces of other such structures. The team also reports its findings today in a Special Publication of the Geological Society of London."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":601,"title":"Andy Murray beats Novak Djokovic to win ATP World Tour Finals title and seal world number one spot","class":1,"body":"Britain's Andy Murray beat five-time champion Novak Djokovic to win his first ATP World Tour Finals title and end 2016 as the world number one. With the year-end top ranking on the line, Murray won the much-anticipated final 6-3 6-4 at London's O2 Arena. I'm very happy to win and to be world number one is very special, said the Scot. It's very special playing against Novak in a match like this. Murray, 29, extended his career-best winning run to 24 matches. The victory also ends Djokovic's four-year run of success at the tournament and the Serb's bid to equal Roger Federer's record of six titles. Murray, who had won 10 of the pair's previous 34 encounters, added: We've played Grand Slam finals and in the Olympics before, but I am very happy to win. It is something I never expected, he said, his win capping off a weekend that also saw brother Jamie Murray and partner Bruno Soares crowned world number one doubles pair. A capacity crowd of 17,000 packed into the O2 Arena to witness a match that felt more like a heavyweight championship boxing bout than a tennis match, and it was Murray who rose to the occasion. Andy is definitely number one in the world, said Djokovic. He deserved to win. He is the best player. In the decisive moments, I wasn't able to come back. I played better late in the match but it wasn't enough. Murray went into the match having played over three hours more than Djokovic during the course of the week, but in the end it was his big-match sharpness that prevailed. He played with far greater purpose than Djokovic, who made 30 unforced errors in an unusually erratic performance. Murray's experience of winning matches day in, day out through the second half of the year shone through, in contrast to the more tentative Djokovic we have seen since he won the French Open. The Briton did open the match with a double fault, and another three points later, but he pressed for the break at 3-3 after Djokovic sent an easy smash wildly long and wide. The breakthrough game two games later when Murray fired a forehand into the corner for a 5-3 lead, and the set followed after 46 minutes. Murray simply grew stronger and Djokovic more error-prone as the second set unfolded, two breaks giving him a seemingly impregnable 4-1 lead, before the champion fought back. Djokovic recovered one break and raced through a service game to cut the deficit to 4-3, but Murray steadied the ship with a solid service hold to move within a game of victory. When he beat Djokovic to win Wimbledon in 2013, Murray had to come through a tortuous 14-minute final game, and there was more tension this time. The crowd were gripped as two match points passed before Djokovic finally succumbed on the third to give up his title - and the mantle of best player in the world."}

Mal Meninga's team went through the tournament unbeaten - and in wrestling the title from the Kiwis reclaimed the world number one ranking. With a quarter of the match gone, tries from Blake Ferguson, Josh Dugan and Trent Merrin plus a penalty from Johnathan Thurston gave the Kangaroos an unassailable 20-0 lead. That was 24-0 by the break as the ruthless Australians added to their score when Dugan touched down a kick from Thurston. Full-back Darius Boyd extinguished any hope of an unlikely comeback with a score shortly after the restart and although two tries from Jordan Kahu reduced the deficit, Australia's Boyd Cordner had the final word with a late score. Aussies back on top Australia coach Meninga is a Liverpool FC fan and must have been delighted with the ruthless performance from his team at Anfield. Meninga had targeted reclaiming the world number one ranking during this tour and that never looked in doubt on a chilly Sunday afternoon when their opponents were simply unable to answer the questions asked of them. The defending champions briefly rallied after Ferguson had touched down in the corner two minutes in and again for a period in the second half, but by and large Australia were utterly dominant. Brilliantly marshalled by halves Thurston and Cooper Cronk and hooker Cameron Smith, they built pressure, dominated field position and looked a class above the only team to have come anywhere near them in this tournament, their group game at Coventry ending 14-8. They targeted the defence of makeshift Kiwi half-back Tohu Harris, kicked penalties to extend their lead even when the game was surely already theirs and for most of the match showed a hunger and desire way beyond what the Kiwis possessed. One year before the World Cup, it is difficult to see on the form they have shown in England how any other team can prevent them from retaining their title. Plenty for Kidwell to consider This competition was David Kidwell's first as coach of New Zealand - and aside from claiming his first win in their 17-16 victory over England, little has gone right for him or his team. They were held to a draw by Scotland at Workington last week and at Anfield looked some way short of producing the sort of mercurial, against-the-odds performance that saw them win the Four Nations in 2014. New Zealand have now lost four times to Australia in 2016 - once in Stephen Kearney's last game in charge and three times under Kidwell. There has been some speculation in the Kiwi press that Kidwell would benefit from a coaching mentor and right now there is plenty for him to think about. Shaun Johnson showed glimpses of the brilliance he possesses during the tournament but plus points were at a premium. New Zealand's poor record in England continues - they lost a Test series against England in 2015 and have not won a Tri-Nations or Four Nations over here - and they will need to vastly improve if they want to threaten at the World Cup. How they lined up Australia: D. Boyd, Ferguson, Inglis, Dugan, Holmes, Thurston, Cronk, Scott, Smith, Woods, Cordner, Gillett, Merrin. Replacements: Morgan, Klemmer, Frizell, S. Boyd. New Zealand: Kahu, Fusitu'a, Kata, Kenny-Dowall, Rapana, Harris, Johnson, J. Bromwich, Luke, Blair, Proctor, Ma'u, Taumalolo.

Cane, who will miss Saturday's game against France because of injury, has been reported for the high tackle which ended Robbie Henshaw's game early on. Fekitoa, who scored two tries in Dublin, has been cited for a high tackle on Simon Zebo after half-time. Disciplinary hearings for both are set to held on Monday or Tuesday. England's Launchbury cited for alleged kick against Fiji Flanker Cane's shoulder appeared to connect with Henshaw's neck region and led to the Ireland centre being taken off after only 10 minutes with his neck in a brace. Referee Jaco Peyper opted to only award a penalty, while Cane was forced to leave the field shortly afterwards with an ankle injury which will rule him out of the Stade de France contest. Fekitoa was sin-binned for his high challenge on Zebo early in the second half but returned to score New Zealand's clinching third try in the 65th minute. Sunday's statement from the autumn internationals disciplinary authorities said both players had been cited for allegedly tackling an opponent dangerously. Prior to the autumn Tests, World Rugby warned reckless contact with a player's head could result in red cards, leading to the expectation that referees would be more stringent when it came to high tackles. With New Zealand players making several other dubious challenges in addition to those of Cane and Fekitoa, Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was asked about the All Blacks' physicality following the game, but opted to keep his own counsel on the issue. We don't control that, the New Zealand-born Ireland coach told RTE. We've just got to forge ahead with who we had left once once those guys had been knocked around.

{"id":604,"title":"Chelsea: Victor Moses goes from outcast to key role under Antonio Conte","class":1,"body":"Before the start of this season, Victor Moses had not played a league game for Chelsea for more than three years, but now he has a key role in the 3-4-3 system that has taken them top of the Premier League. Moses, 25, has been out on loan at Liverpool, Stoke and West Ham during that time but he did not establish himself at any of those clubs either. So his current situation is a huge turnaround for a player who, partly because of injury, started only 38 league games in the past three seasons, completing 90 minutes just 12 times. He has a new lease of life because Blues manager Antonio Conte has given him a chance at right wing-back. It is a new position for the Nigeria international, but it suits his strengths and, as he showed in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Middlesbrough on Sunday, he is not just filling in there - he is thriving. From winger to wing-back - why the switch is working I played as a wing-back a lot during my career, particularly when I was younger in the mid-to-late 1990s when that system was last popular in the Premier League. I used to enjoy it because, like Moses, it suited my game. Like him, I was more of an attacker than a defender and wing-backs have the freedom to get forward when they want. Yes, you have to be disciplined defensively and decide when to join the attack or hold back, but you have the freedom of the touchline and the ability to impose yourself on the game far more than you can as a normal winger. By timing your runs you can come from deep with a head of steam and burst into great positions - the sort of thing that Moses was doing against Boro when he used his power and pace to great effect. He was not directly involved in Chelsea's winner but it was his shot that led to the corner that Diego Costa scored from. Why Chelsea's system suits Moses It helps Moses that he has got a really stable set-up behind him thanks to N'Golo Kante and Nemanja Matic. Moses knows at least one of them will drop in too, so Chelsea's three-man defence is rarely left without cover even if he does not get back. So he can really bomb forward as much as he likes, especially in games like Sunday where his side were on top for long spells. Boro defended very deep, Chelsea saw a lot of the ball and he could push high up the pitch. The home side did not really deal very well with Chelsea's shape and their full-back Fabio was being dragged inside by Pedro. Kante was also getting forward on the left and Gaston Ramirez did not know how to deal with him and Moses, meaning Moses got a lot of room. How Conte's passion can help Moses progress The attacking aspect of the wing-back role plays to Moses' strengths but he still dropped into defence when he had to at Riverside Stadium. Moses is fast and fit and another reason he is good at getting back is that he has got his manager on the sidelines screaming at him. He will not mind getting instructions like that because he is learning the position as he goes. Like Marcos Alonso on the opposite flank, Sunday was only the sixth game he has played there. Moses is doing a very good job already, but he will definitely get better the longer he plays in that role. Video analysis will help him develop too I found part of the way I learned about playing wing-back was by watching my games, and looking at my movement at different moments - when I went forward and stayed, and seeing what I should have done. Video analysis at clubs is just another part of the game now, but it was not always that way. For me as a wing-back, it helped to develop my positional sense and see where I could pick up the ball to influence the game and hurt the opposition. But it made the biggest difference to the defensive side of my game. Teams played 3-5-2 then, rather than 3-4-3, but the same applies - by doing the same, Moses will learn about the structure of his side in that formation. He will see how to get in a position where he can either get back quickly to help his defence out or, ideally, discourage passes outside his centre-halves, which is where teams who play three at the back are vulnerable."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":605,"title":"India v England: Stuart Broad says tourists can save second Test","class":1,"body":"England still have hope of saving the second Test against India, according to pace bowler Stuart Broad. Openers Haseeb Hameed and Alastair Cook shared 75 in 50 overs but both fell late on day four to leave England 87-2 in their chase of an unlikely 405 to win in Visakhapatnam. We're coming into tomorrow with a lot of batting left, Broad told BBC Sport. They showed that you can bat on this pitch if you stick to your gameplan and you are mentally strong. With the tourists needing to bat out five sessions, Hameed and Cook shared England's slowest opening half-century stand since 1998 before Hameed was trapped lbw by Ravichandran Ashwin for 25. Cook looked set to reach the close in the company of Joe Root, but the captain fell leg before to Ravi Jadeja for 54 from the second ball of the final over. It's disappointing any time you lose a wicket in the last over, said Broad. But I think we would have taken losing two wickets in 60 overs on this pitch. If we can start as nicely and calmly as the openers did we've got a great chance. Can England save the Test? Listen to Boycott's verdict For 19-year-old Hameed, a 144-ball stay at the crease further underlined his promise after he made 82 on debut in the drawn first Test. He's got a calm character about him, added Broad. Today he showed a huge toughness. He got hit quite nastily on the hand and he battled through that. He showed a bit of old-school Test match character. Broad, 30, claimed four wickets in India's second innings, despite suffering from a strained tendon in his left foot. The problem is with my tendon in between the first and second toe, he said. It feels like I'm constantly stepping on a plug every time I plant my foot. It's extremely painful to play on. I need to find out a bit more detail on the injury before I can think about the next Test. It will be a case of resting it as much as possible and letting the bleeding go down. Hopefully in the next couple of days I can get my feet up and rest - and not be needed to bat."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":606,"title":"Andy Murray rise to world number one 'pretty amazing', says John McEnroe","class":1,"body":"Andy Murray, showered in ticker-tape and applause, carried the same dazed and disbelieving look at the ATP World Tour Finals on Sunday evening that we saw when he finally won Wimbledon three years ago. To topple Novak Djokovic at the O2 Arena was a mighty achievement, to replace him as the best player in the world was simply extraordinary. Murray had managed to overhaul the Serb in the rankings with a remarkable run of form in the second half of the season, but beating him across the net proved it was more than a statistical quirk. As Djokovic himself said: Andy is definitely number one in the world. What we know about the Scot is that he will leave no stone unturned in trying to permanently dethrone Djokovic. Murray switches focus to Grand Slams Murray is an amazing athlete. He's going to try to take advantage of this time because it's limited, we all know that, said former number one John McEnroe. I do anticipate he's going to do everything possible to take advantage of it. But I would hope there's a lot of hungry players behind him that see a void and an opening, as well as Novak, who wants to catch Rafa Nadal and potentially Roger Federer. Mats Wilander: Murray has learned how you have to keep on practising harder and harder and harder, just to stay where you are. Murray's work ethic is well known, and remains as punishing as ever as he enters the latter stages of his career. The second serve was long seen as a weakness in his game, and is something he has taken steps to address. The success was there for all to see in his semi-final at the O2 - no longer a timid effort there for the taking, it dug him out of trouble more than once against Milos Raonic. Heading into the season finale at the O2 Arena, Murray had won 54% of the points on his second serve in 2016 - a 2% rise on the previous year and equalling his best ever. Hardly an eye-popping statistic, but one of a number of 'marginal gains' that, played out across 11 months and 18 tournaments, can make a significant difference to the more obvious numbers of titles won and ranking points gained. How many times have we said to be more aggressive on his return? Move forward more often? Hit his forehand bigger? said McEnroe. He's been extremely patient, he's persevered and he's also gotten better. That combination is hard to do when you've been dealt a bunch of blows against three of the greatest players who ever lived. To come out of that a better player, and a better man it appears, is pretty amazing, so I give him a lot of credit."}

Former Russian sports minister Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia's anti-doping commission, said it has never conducted a state-sponsored doping programme. Wada pushed for a complete ban on Russian athletes from the Rio Olympics. The International Olympic Committee decided instead to leave the decision to individual sports federations. It came after an independent report found evidence of widespread state-sponsored doping in Russia in the lead up to the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014. At Sunday's foundation board meeting in Glasgow, Wada announced that the second part of the independent report, compiled by Professor Richard McLaren, is to be released on 9 December. Sir Craig Reedie, who has been re-elected as Wada president for a second three-year term, said he was confident Wada was making progress with Russia. The facts are that the McLaren commission indicated that there had been breaches of the code involving the Moscow lab and the ministry of sport, said the 75-year-old Scot. To that extent, that's the scale of the issue we have to deal with. I'm really, really keen to move forward. We need to have Russia compliant. Wada also announced proposals to seek greater powers to impose sanctions, as well as a new whistleblower programme aimed at protecting and encouraging athletes or officials who seek to highlight doping. What we started today was a roadmap on compliance, added Reedie. People have been saying to us that non-serious compliance needs non-serious sanctions - and that serious non-compliance needs serious sanctions. There is quite clearly a feeling within the athlete community that this should be done. There is much work to be done. It will take massive consultation before we get to the finished article. The body said at its board meeting in Glasgow that people are still at risk from cyber-hackers who are trying to access athletes' medical records.

Can this Sunday’s slate measure up with Week 10’s terrific schedule of thrilling finishes and battles between the league’s top teams. Based solely on the matchups, achieving that goal appears optimistic. Just four of the remaining 13 games feature point spreads of less than a touchdown, with the New England Patriots — fresh from their last-second loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 10 — expected to punish the 1-8 San Francisco 49ers. But a dubious record has been surpassed with 11 missed extra-point attempts Sunday. Wind played a factor in the Meadowlands where kickers for the Giants and the visiting Chicago Bears both missed their first attempts, then Giants kicker Robbie Gould missed another in the third quarter. Bengals kicker Mike Nugent has missed twice in Cincinnati against the Buffalo Bills. Kickers for the Browns, Lions, Vikings, Jaguars, Patriots and Seahawks have also failed to connect on extra-point kick attempts. In the first week of December 2015, NFL kickers also combined to miss nine extra point kicks in a single Sunday. Per ESPN, the record, according to Elias Sports Bureau, was 10, set in 1985. There has clearly been a huge impact on the kicking game after the league moved back the extra-point kick distance from 20 yards to 33 at the start of the 2015 season. With four games left to play, there’s a decent chance today could become the most infamous day in the history of NFL placekicking. That, however, is not the kind of tension that will help the league recover from a season-long ratings slump that seemed to rebound last week. [NFL kickers are lost in Week 11.] In Seattle, quarterback Russell Wilson has long since proven that he can both run and throw for Seahawks touchdowns. On Sunday, he showed the world that he’s equipped to catch them too. In the Seahawks matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles, Wilson tossed the ball to a motioning Doug Baldwin and the players then switched roles, with Baldwin finding a streaking Wilson down the sideline and into the end zone for a 15-yard score and a 23-7 Seattle edge. Razzle dazzle. More intrigue may be found in some individual story lines, including the long awaited (and to some, long overdue) debut of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff. Goff, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft has watched from the sidelines as Case Keenum has led the struggling offense to just a 4-5 record. The rookie got off to a solid start, orchestrating a Rams touchdown on his first drive when Todd Gurley ran one in. But late defensive breakdowns cost the Rams, Goff struggled and the Dolphins scored two fourth quarter touchdowns to win 14-10. The loss was No. 162 for Rams coach Jeff Fisher, tying him with Cowboys legend Tom Landry for the second most in NFL history."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":615,"title":"Late penalty call leads to Blue Jackets’ game-winner, leaves Capitals hung up","class":1,"body":"Center Nicklas Backstrom offered an uncharacteristically blunt take in front of his locker, still fuming over the high-sticking penalty that ultimately led to the Washington Capitals’ 3-2 defeat against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday afternoon at Verizon Center. Backstrom had been baffled by the call as soon as the whistle blew, and he grew even more sour once it led to Blue Jackets forward Alexander Wennberg’s game-winner on the ensuing power play with 53.6 seconds remaining in regulation. While chasing the puck with less than two minutes left in the third period of a tie game, Backstrom reached out with his stick in front of Columbus captain Nick Foligno’s face. Foligno then snapped his head back as if he’d been hit. The sequence overshadowed what had otherwise been another strong performance by Backstrom, who continued his recent surge by scoring the Capitals’ first goal and assisting on their second. I didn’t touch him, Backstrom said. It was really weird I got a penalty there. Capitals Coach Barry Trotz deemed Foligno’s actions on the play a little bit disrespectful to the game and called on the NHL to issue some form of discipline for diving. He doesn’t really touch him, and then his head pops up when Backy’s stick is already on the way down, Trotz said. The league will look at that, and we have fines for that . . . I wouldn’t be too happy if I was the referee. No amount of money, however, will be able to replace the points in the standings that a depleted Washington lineup watched slip away in its second loss to the Blue Jackets in less than a week. For the second time in five days, the Capitals debuted shuffled forward combinations. But unlike the changes Trotz initiated last week to jump-start his team’s offense, these were made out of necessity. Washington played Sunday’s matinee without forwards T.J. Oshie and Lars Eller, both out with upper-body injuries suffered in Friday’s 1-0 win over Detroit. In their place, rookie Zach Sanford moved from wing to center, and winger Paul Carey, a call-up from Hershey, entered the lineup. But it was the Capitals’ new top line, with veteran Justin Williams joining Swedes Backstrom and Marcus Johansson, that provided them with an early jolt. [After three goals in two games, will Backstrom start shooting more?] A little over three minutes in, Backstrom collected a failed clearance attempt along the boards and fired a soft wrist shot toward the net that caromed off Columbus defenseman Jack Johnson before sliding through the five-hole of goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky. The goal, Backstrom’s fourth in as many games and one that he said was actually intended to be a pass to Johansson, gave the Capitals a quick 1-0 cushion. Washington’s adjustments didn’t all go smoothly, though. Eller and Oshie each had prominent roles on the penalty kill, and without them, Foligno knotted the score just 13 seconds into the game’s first power play. The Capitals recovered shortly thereafter on their own man advantage when a familiar combination promptly gave them the lead back midway through the second period. Backstrom saucered a pass through traffic, and captain Alex Ovechkin blasted a one-timer into the back of the net. It was the Capitals’ first five-on-four goal since an Oct. 30 win at Calgary, an unlikely slump for a power play that had previously been one of the league’s most dangerous units during much of the Ovechkin era. But Columbus responded emphatically 14 seconds into the third period after a loose puck ricocheted off the skate of winger Cam Atkinson and landed directly on teammate Brandon Dubinsky’s stick in front of the net. Dubinsky immediately deked Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby and tied the game again. You don’t want to give up goals first minute and last minute of the period, and we gave up two, defenseman Karl Alzner said. Trotz contended that icing should have been called before the Blue Jackets scored their second goal, which set the stage for the penalty he and Backstrom so vehemently disagreed with. Columbus then took advantage of a panic situation that the Capitals never expected to happen, according to Holtby. In a matter of 40 seconds, forwards Sam Gagner, Foligno and Wennberg had connected on a series of tic-tac-toe passes to beat a helpless Holtby, and Washington headed to its locker room stewing. The last two minutes, you get a penalty that isn’t a penalty, Backstrom said. That’s tough."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":616,"title":"Kirk Cousins passes for 375 yards and Redskins pull away from Packers, 42-24","class":1,"body":"It was a playoff rematch billed for prime-time television. Almost 11 months ago, the Washington Redskins crumbled through 60 minutes at the hands of the Green Bay Packers in the first round to end their surprising 2015 season. Just 10 weeks ago, the Redskins couldn’t handle the national stage in a seasonopening blowout loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. On Sunday night, the Redskins grew up on the national stage. They received contributions from both sides of the ball to produce their most resounding win of the season, defeating the Packers, 42-24, at FedEx Field. Kirk Cousins and Aaron Rodgers traded haymakers in the fourth quarter, accumulating 34 combined points in the final 15 minutes. Green Bay cut into Washington’s 12-point lead, 22-10, on the first play of the final quarter when Rodgers connected with running back James Starks, who sneaked out of the backfield on a delayed route and went untouched on a 31-yard touchdown reception. Cousins responded on the ensuing drive with a 70-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Pierre Garcon just 26 seconds later. Rodgers followed a six-play, 75-yard touchdown drive with an eight-play, 82-yard drive that ended with the same result. He fired a six-yard pass to tight end Jared Cook, who beat safety Will Blackmon in one-on-one coverage on the slant, for his third touchdown pass. That set up Washington’s 11-play drive to seal its sixth win in eight games. Redskins Coach Jay Gruden opted to go for it on fourth and one at Washington’s 41, and Cousins gained two yards on the sneak to extend the drive. He threw another pass to wide receiver Jamison Crowder, who was open in the middle of the field for a 53-yard gain. Kelley ended the drive on a one-yard touchdown, one of three scores for the undrafted rookie. He scored another touchdown, from four yards out with less than three minutes left, to put the game away. Kelley gained 137 rushing yards on 24 carries, averaging 5.7 yards per attempt. Cousins finished 21 of 30 for 375 yards with three touchdowns and a 145.8 passer rating in one of the best performances in his career. He matched the efforts from Rodgers, who finished 26 of 41 for 351 yards with three touchdowns and a 115 passer rating. Neither quarterback threw an interception. The Redskins led 13-10 at halftime following Kelley’s 10-yard touchdown run with 39 seconds left in the first half. Chris Thompson failed to convert on the two-point attempt, as Washington opted to run a play instead of attempting the extra point to seek a four-point lead. The Redskins dealt with windy conditions in the east end zone and a new long snapper, Rick Lovato, that would’ve made for a more challenging point after touchdown on a day in which an NFL-record 11 extra points were missed. Packers place kicker Mason Crosby later missed a 36-yard field goal wide left towards the east end zone during the third quarter, and Hopkins missed an extra point late in the fourth quarter to justify Gruden’s decision. The touchdown drive gave Washington the lead in a second quarter that felt strikingly similar to the first-round playoff matchup last year up until that point. The Redskins dominated the first quarter, like they did in the playoffs, before giving away the lead. They forced Rodgers into three straight three-and-outs to start the game for the first time in his career, according to NFL Research. Green Bay gained just nine yards on its first nine plays, and that resulted in three punts as Washington’s defensive line controlled the trenches in the opening quarter. Cousins struck first on a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson, who was listed as questionable because of a shoulder injury. The score capped an eight-play, 55-yard drive in which Cousins was 5 of 6 for 48 yards.The Packers responded with 10 unanswered points in the second quarter. They tied the game at 7 on a 17-play, 75-yard drive that ended on Rodgers’s 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jordy Nelson, who lost control of the ball once cornerback Josh Norman poked it out. It was still ruled a touchdown after review. Crosby later drilled a 36-yard field goal to give Green Bay its first lead with less than four minutes left before halftime. Washington’s defense couldn’t maintain its first-quarter performance, allowing 424 total yards in the victory, but it came through with two turnovers late in the game to avoid a late collapse. Norman stripped Cook on a six-yard reception, and linebacker Will Compton recovered the loose ball with about three minutes left to set up Kelley’s third touchdown. Martrell Spaight added an interception with 1:31 left. The Redskins will now have a quick turnaround to prepare for their Thanksgiving contest against the Dallas Cowboys, who sit atop the NFC East at 9-1 after beating the Baltimore Ravens. Washington won’t practice this week as a result of the difficult stretch and instead will opt for two walkthroughs before taking off for Dallas on Wednesday."}

I don’t know how he did it, Gruden said of Cousins’s deep-ball accuracy in the fourth quarter. The one to Pierre was a 70-yard touchdown. I don’t think I could throw the ball ten yards into that [wind], but he spun it. He’s always been able to knife a ball through the wind, really. Rodgers followed a six-play, 75-yard touchdown drive with an eight-play, 82-yard drive that ended with the same result. He fired a six-yard pass to tight end Jared Cook, who beat safety Will Blackmon in one-on-one coverage on the slant, for his third touchdown pass. That man is an alien, rookie linebacker Su’a Cravens said of his first matchup against Rodgers. That’s one of the hardest games I’ve ever played. He’s a wizard in the pocket and the thing is he never takes his eyes from down the field. He just feels you, somehow runs away to avoid everybody else to throw a 30-yard rope down the field. That man is a savage. Washington followed with an 11-play drive to seal its sixth win in eight games. Redskins Coach Jay Gruden opted to go for it on fourth and one at the Washington 41, and Cousins gained two yards on the sneak to extend the drive.

{"id":618,"title":"Garth Crooks' team of the week: Luiz, Defoe, Toure, Mata, Alonso, Courtois","class":1,"body":"Chelsea moved top of the Premier League with their sixth straight win, climbing above previous leaders Liverpool, who dropped points at Southampton. Arsenal were also held to a draw at Manchester United, while there were wins for Manchester City,Tottenham Hotspur,Bournemouth and Watford. Sunderland helped their fight against relegation with a win against Hull, but Swansea go bottom after drawing at Everton. Do you agree with my team of the week? Or would you go for a different line-up? Why not pick your very own from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists and share it with your friends? Pick your Team of the Week Pick your XI from our list and share with your friends. Thibaut Courtois is starting to look as safe as houses again. He only had two real saves to make in the entire match against Middlesbrough and he was equal to the test. The Belgium international had his difficulties last season and was being asked to play like a sweeper at times in order for his defence to hold a high line, which didn't suit him at all. But now he is performing in a new-look back five and looking like a top-class keeper again. And we all know you can't win the Premier League title without one. He's only gone and done it again. Seamus Coleman just adores scoring goals. I desperately wanted to put Manchester United's Antonio Valencia in my team of the week for the way he played against Arsenal. But I just had to select Coleman for such a wonderful headed goal against Swansea, and for his all-round commitment. I've seen some impressive headed goals at Everton over the years but nothing that even comes close from a full-back. Nevertheless, Everton could have lost this game, which would have compounded manager Ronald Koeman's first mini-crisis at Goodison. It's clear the beating dished out by Chelsea a couple of weeks ago is still weighing heavily on Everton minds. Virgil van Dijk was absolutely brilliant throughout Southampton's draw with Liverpool - and his performance was typified by a tremendous tackle on former team-mate Sadio Mane.But it was the Dutchman's discreet tug on Roberto Firmino's shirt inside the box that changed Southampton's fortunes. None of the officials saw it, which was just as well for Southampton and Van Dijk. Such an offence would have resulted in a penalty, almost a certain goal for Liverpool the way James Milner has been tucking them away, and an immediate suspension for Van Dijk. In this case, discretion was certainly the better part of valour. If you want to know the individual who has made the difference in this new Chelsea back five, you need look no further than David Luiz. Against Middlesbrough, he never missed a header, a tackle, or an interception. In fact, he was the architect of the move of the match that resulted in Pedro's strike crashing against the underside of the bar. Luiz has been immense since his return to Stamford Bridge. The victory over the Boro was as emphatic as it was stylish and takes them to the top of the Premier League table for the first time since May 2015. Chelsea are the best team in the league at the moment, with steel and flair in equal proportions. The late, great Howard Kendall once said that winning trophies was like sipping champagne; once you've had a taste, you keep going back for more. Antonio Conte has enjoyed a sip or two of success over the years. By the look of his new-look Chelsea team's recent performances, both he and they are developing a taste for more in the months ahead. On-loan Chelsea defender Nathan Ake was superb against Stoke - but how the Potters did not win this game I will never know. Referee Roger East must hold his hands up. He missed one of the most blatant penalty decisions ever witnessed as he waved play on when Ryan Shawcross scythed down Callum Wilson, yet penalised Simon Francis for what can only be described as clumsiness. I've often argued that defenders can't afford to be clumsy in the box, but this decision was particularly harsh. So, it was just as well that Ake provided the finish that gave Bournemouth all three points. East can now rest easy, knowing that following his decision, any other outcome would have been a travesty, regardless of how well Stoke played. I must be honest; I wasn't sure about Marcos Alonso as Chelsea's left-back, but that was probably due to having watched Ashley Cole for a number of seasons. However, with every clean sheet Chelsea have achieved this season, Alonso has grown. Against Middlesbrough, he started to look more reassured going forward, always making himself available, and even forcing an impressive save out of Victor Valdes. Chelsea have struggled to find a naturally left-footed full-back since the departure of former England international Cole. Now they have one, and boy does it make a difference."}

Speaking after he came off the bench for Manchester United in their draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford on Saturday, the 31-year-old claimed: What's been going on is disgraceful. I love playing for my country and I am proud of my achievements to date - but I have not finished yet. England players are to be banned by the Football Association from having nights out while on international duty.

Pundit reaction - OK he has had a drink, so, what? Speaking on Match of the Day, former England striker Ian Wright said: I'm a big fan of Wayne's and he's been getting this for the past three or four years. It has been building and building. I'm pleased he's coming out with something like this. It is like he is fighting back. Fight back Wayne. Ex-England captain Alan Shearer added: All he has ever been is committed and available. If he was given the night off and he chose to stay in the hotel and have a few drinks then I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If he was told to go to bed by the manager and chose not to then he has undermined the manager and has to face the consequences. Stoke midfielder and Scotland international Charlie Adam said on MOTD 2 Extra: I totally agree with Rooney, he is spot on. He is the captain of his country and been one of the top players for a number of years. OK, he has had a drink, so what? He has been in the hotel and tried to do the right thing because he is a professional. England staff were there too. We have all been there on an international. We would meet up on a Sunday and we would have a one or two drinks before bed because we have all been playing at the weekend. It would never happen in the week. They have had a game, it is finished, they got back to the hotel and had a couple of drinks.

He scored seven times in 35 games last season, compared to 20 goals in 45 appearances in 2014-15, after threatening to not play for club chairman Jeremy Peace. This last year has been the most difficult of my career and it has left me short of the form and fitness required for the Premier League, said Berahino. I have never been a player who lacked confidence or a belief in himself but that has been where I have found myself and it has hit me hard. It has left me feeling depressed and struggling for focus which has made it even more difficult to regain full fitness.

Southgate, 46, will meet the FA hierarchy on Monday for what is effectively his interview for the role. There is a board meeting on 30 November of the main FA board and I think Gareth will be the manager by then, Bevington told BBC Radio 5 live. I don't think they will be speaking to anybody else. Southgate has just concluded a four-game stint as interim manager following Sam Allardyce's departure in September, beating Malta and Scotland and drawing with Slovenia and Spain. He will be interviewed at St George's Park by a panel including FA chairman Greg Clarke, chief executive Martin Glenn and technical director Dan Ashworth, as well as League Managers' Association chairman Howard Wilkinson and former England defender Graeme le Saux. I think Gareth is the only candidate because he has earned it, he should get it and he is the right man for the job, Bevington, who was managing director of Club England from 2010-2014 and spent 17 years at the FA, told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek. He said the FA need to be promoting English coaches after previous experiments with foreign bosses Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello. I found Capello and Eriksson very relaxed about dealing with the media. They didn't seem to be affected by that in any way but I genuinely believe the England team should be managed by an Englishman, Bevington said. There are number of phrases used to describe Gareth - he's a bit too soft, a safe pair of hands, a company man. But he is very intelligent and highly experienced football player and coach at international level. He's the most suitable person out there and the last two months, particularly the performance against Spain, have enhanced that. I've spent a lot of time with Gareth and his interaction with the players is fantastic. If you talk to him privately you understand what his beliefs about football are, that's why Arsene Wenger is a great admirer of Gareth, that's why his beliefs in football are first class. 5 live In Short: I've no idea which parking space to park in – Southgate Football Daily podcast - is there a better option for England than Southgate? The FA insists there is no time frame for making the appointment, with England's next game a friendly in Germany in March, and the final decision will be taken by Clarke, Glenn and Ashworth. The organisation is determined not to be rushed into an appointment and wants to conduct a thorough process, although no other interviews are currently scheduled and Southgate is firm favourite to take over on a full-time basis.

Palace prop up the rest It was only in September that Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew said managing England was the pinnacle for any Englishman's career, and with no permanent manager in place for the Three Lions, 'Pards' may still get a call. But only if they ignore his numbers in 2016. The Londoners were nine minutes away from winning the FA Cup at Wembley in May, prompting a touchline jig from Pardew, before Manchester United turned the game around to win in extra time. Decent in the cup, but dreadful in the league. Palace have played 31 Premier League games this year, claiming just 22 points, which works out at 0.71 points per game. So how bad is the run? Palace fans - look away now. It is the worst of all 92 professional teams in English football. The Eagles have also gone 17 league games without keeping a clean sheet, although this run is still a long way off West Brom's record of conceding in 34 straight games.

Toure said sorry on Seluk's behalf at the start of November but there had been no indication from Guardiola that his situation had changed, and few people even knew he was in the City squad that travelled to south London. He was given a noisy reception by the travelling City fans, who chanted his name throughout the game, and his efforts were also appreciated by his team-mates, who clapped him back into the dressing room at the final whistle. My team-mates are very important to me, added Toure. They have always been brilliant with me, always supportive. I always want to be there to help them. I am professional, I always want to improve my game. 'Toure is going to help us rotate the team' – Guardiola Guardiola had picked Toure in only one of City's previous 19 games this season - a Champions League qualifying play-off second leg against Steaua Bucharest in August that was a virtual dead rubber after City had won the first game 6-0. But the City boss says he has been impressed by the player's application while he was out of favour and feels he has a part to play in his side's title challenge. The last month and a half, Yaya was amazing in training, Guardiola explained. His behaviour is absolutely everything. His team-mates love him. He is going to help us to rotate the team, we need that. I am so happy for Yaya, he is a really nice guy. His weight is perfect now, and there are no doubts about his quality. At the beginning we did not count on him, he would not be here, but he can play many positions and we have one more man to help us achieve our targets. Analysis - John Motson, MOTD commentator at Selhurst Park It has been a long stand-off between Yaya and Pep, with his agent in the middle of it. It's gone on for three months but he was determined to make up for it. Toure almost won the title for City here a few years ago and on Saturday he was at it again."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":625,"title":"Felipe Massa: Why does Formula 1 love retiring Brazilian driver?","class":1,"body":"Felipe Massa no doubt allowed himself to daydream about how his final Brazilian Grand Prix would play out. Would he score points? Would he make the podium? Would he - whisper it - go out and win the thing? Whatever was swirling in his mind before the race in his home city of Sao Paulo, the very last thing he would have wanted was a retirement - yet that is exactly what he got. But in a weird and wonderful way, that was perhaps the best thing that could have happened, because what followed was one of the most heart-warming sights ever witnessed in this usually hard-headed and ruthless sport. On lap 48 of 71, Massa's Williams crashed on the pit straight and retired on the spot. Crestfallen, the Brazilian climbed from his broken car to be greeted by a wall of applause and cheering from the home crowd. Listen: 'Massa is wiping tears from his eyes' Andrew Benson: 'It takes a special person to survive at Ferrari for eight seasons' He broke down in tears as he walked back to the pits draped in the Brazilian flag - cheers ringing in his ears throughout - and then members of other teams, including Mercedes and his old employers Ferrari, walked out of their garages and gave him a guard of honour. Then came an embrace from his wife and young son Felipe Jr, and the tears came anew. Massa will officially retire from F1 after next weekend's season-finale in Abu Dhabi, but his goodbye to the sport has already happened. Nothing will top Interlagos. Why does F1 love Massa? Rewind to 2002 and, to be blunt, there was not a great deal to excite your average fan when presented with a new 20-year-old F1 driver named Felipe Massa. A former Italian and European Formula Renault champion, and the reigning Euro Formula 3000 champion, Massa was nevertheless a largely unknown quantity when he was handed a Sauber drive after impressing in a test session at Mugello, Italy. While team owner Peter Sauber was in no doubt about Massa's remarkable potential, to outside observers he appeared just another erratic F1 rookie. Quick, yes, but ragged. Sauber even sat him out of a race late in the season after he incurred the wrath of the FIA for a wild move on Pedro de la Rosa at the Italian Grand Prix. When Peter Sauber shuffled him out of the team to spend 2003 testing with engine supplier Ferrari, some undoubtedly presumed that was the end of Massa in F1. How wrong they were."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":626,"title":"Lewis Hamilton v Nico Rosberg: How the 2016 title may be decided","class":1,"body":"There is one race to go and Lewis Hamilton has his work cut out if he is to win a fourth world drivers' title. With one grand prix to go, the Briton trails Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by 12 points, with a maximum of 25 available in the last race. Can Hamilton come from behind to pip the German or will Rosberg be celebrating his maiden drivers' crown? BBC Sport takes a look at how the title may be decided... How can the title be won? Hamilton has won the past three races ahead of Rosberg, but a similar result in the final race of the season would hand the German his first title. For Hamilton to win his fourth world title - after successes in 2008, 2014 and 2015 - he needs to claim victory in Abu Dhabi on Sunday and hope Rosberg finishes outside the top three, or does not finish at all. If Hamilton comes second, Rosberg would have to finish outside of the top six. There is still a chance for Hamilton, albeit a slight one, if he comes third as he would need Rosberg to finish ninth, 10th, out of the points, or not finish. A retirement for Hamilton would gift Rosberg the title before the race has finished. The Briton has battled for the title in the final race on four occasions - 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2014 - with Rosberg a factor only once before, two years ago. Will engines play a part? Quite possibly. Hamilton's engine failure 16 laps from home in Malaysia prevented an almost certain victory that would have left him leading the championship by five points at that stage. Rosberg's subsequent win - emphatically backed up in Japan - has turned the tide dramatically. Hamilton has had three engine failures this season but Rosberg says he is not worried he could experience a similar problem, as it is something that I cannot influence. Both Hamilton and Rosberg have two new engines left going into the final two races, which should be enough to see them through to the end of the season - barring failures of the kind experienced by the Briton in Malaysia - without incurring grid penalties."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":627,"title":"Max Verstappen's drive in Brazil puts him in the company of the legends - Allan McNish","class":1,"body":"About every 10 years or so, there is a race in which one driver makes his mark and produces a performance that will be remembered for decades to come. Max Verstappen at Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix was one of those days. It happened with Ayrton Senna at Monaco in 1984, when he was so close to beating Alain Prost's McLaren in a Toleman at Monaco in his first Formula 1 season. It happened with Michael Schumacher in Barcelona in 1996, when in torrential rain he regularly lapped five seconds quicker than anyone else and won by 45 seconds. And it happened with Lewis Hamilton at Silverstone in 2008, with a remarkably similar performance to Schumacher's in dreadful conditions, winning by more than a minute. Verstappen did not win, but the 19-year-old Dutchman's drive at Interlagos was right up there with those and other legendary performances in F1 history. The final proof The race was the final piece of evidence that was needed to prove Verstappen really has the potential to be something very special indeed. He has been impressive since he started his career last season but, until quite recently, Australian team-mate Daniel Ricciardo had had the edge this year at Red Bull. That has turned around in the last three races or so, and now Brazil has sealed the deal. The three drivers mentioned at the start of this piece have 14 world titles between them. Verstappen, it is clear, is up with them in terms of capability. Whether he transfers that into world titles, time will tell. But to do what he did in Brazil showed he has all the assets he needs to get the job done. Verstappen already has that aura about him. People like watching him because he's spectacular. Even before the race started, there was a sense he would have a go and make something happen. And when he came back out on the wet tyre after Red Bull abandoned their mistaken plan to try the intermediates, it was not a question of whether he would get in the points but whether he would get on the podium. Only the real superstars have that about them. The challenges of the wet The wet takes away a lot of parameters that define performance, and the driver has a bigger influence on the speed of the car. There's the basic skill required, of course. You need a heightened sensitivity and feel. Reactions have to be super-quick, as was clear not only with the number of spins and near-spins, but also scary moments such as Manor's Esteban Ocon only just avoiding colliding with Kimi Raikkonen's stationary Ferrari on the pit straight at 200mph. Spacial awareness becomes a critical factor. With the spray, a driver cannot see in front of him, so he has to have good peripheral vision to see where he is on track, such as looking for brake marker boards to know when to get off the throttle. The best way to describe it is as follows: think of driving down the motorway in torrential rain with a car in front of you throwing up spray and you have no windscreen wipers. You need real focus, too, because driving flat out in heavy rain is so much more mentally tiring than you can imagine. You just never relax. And then there's the one thing that really stood out with Verstappen - massive confidence, in yourself and the car. The limits are changing every single corner, every single lap. The track evolves with the amount of rain, whether it is getting wetter or drier. At 200mph you are travelling at 90 metres per second. So if you brake too late by 0.1secs, you have travelled nine metres, and the track width is generally a bit less than that. The margin for error is so much less in the wet than in the dry, because you have less grip, both in braking and, particularly, cornering. That means you need to have real feel to go through the transition between longitudinal and lateral grip as you ease off the brakes and turn into the corner."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":628,"title":"Ron Dennis: How broken friendship led to McLaren exit after 35 years as boss","class":1,"body":"Somehow, Ron Dennis' departure from McLaren was no less shocking for knowing it was coming. After all, this is a giant of both Formula 1 and British industry, who has been forced out, by his own partners, of the company he had built up. It is a company that had made him the most successful team boss in F1 history, and which is now one of the world's leading sportscar manufacturers. It is a story with many aspects of a Greek tragedy: a great but flawed man losing the thing he cares about most, at least partly because of his own failings. At its heart is the story of a broken friendship - between Dennis and fellow shareholder Mansour Ojjeh, who were close allies for three decades before they fell out a few years ago. Why? There are stories buzzing around the F1 paddock about it, including one that many of those close to the situation believe to be true but which cannot be detailed here. One thing is clear, however. It got very personal between the two of them before Ojjeh finally won the battle. In truth, it is not hard to see how someone could fall out with Dennis. Undoubtedly a brilliant man, he is also an intensely complex personality: generous and loyal on the one hand, gauche and arrogant on the other. He can also be disarmingly charming, amusing and self-deprecating. Asked about the merit of the Norman Foster-designed McLaren Technology Centre, which opened in 2003 and cost hundreds of millions of pounds, he once offered: Have I built myself a pyramid, you mean? And 20 years or so ago, he told a very funny story about his own well-known obsessive-compulsive tendencies. It was about the new house he and then-wife Lisa had bought, in which fountains had been installed in the rose gardens. When these were first turned on, Dennis said, he was horrified to see that they came on row by row, instead of all at the same time. This wouldn't do, he told the garden designer. They had to come on all at once. But Mr Dennis, responded the designer, it will cost thousands to start again, install all the necessary pumps and so on. Dennis said he didn't care. It had to be done. He couldn't look at it the way it was. Yet his condescension and patronising attitude could take your breath away and he has made a lot of enemies along the way. To journalists, he would publicly pride himself on his oft-repeated claim that he would be economical with the truth but not actually lie to you. Yet sometimes he did. In the late 1990s, I had found out that Mercedes were about to buy a significant but still minority shareholding in McLaren and went to Dennis to verify it. Who's your source? he asked me. When I told him I would not reveal it, he said I should get a new one because this one was wide of the mark. Two weeks later, he stood up at Silverstone and announced that Mercedes had bought a 40% shareholding in McLaren. When he was challenged about it, he initially tried to claim I had asked the wrong question, before eventually conceding that, yes, he had lied. I had to, he said. At Silverstone this year, I asked him what would happen when his contract ran out in mid-January 2017. He said: Oh, don't worry about that. I've signed for another two years."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":629,"title":"Lewis Hamilton's class shows in Brazilian Grand Prix","class":1,"body":"Not too bad, huh? Lewis Hamilton said on the podium after winning the Brazilian Grand Prix. You can say that again. The 52nd victory of the Mercedes driver's career kept the title fight alive for a final-race showdown in Abu Dhabi in two weeks' time. Rosberg will start that race as a strong favourite to become world champion. But a chaotic, crash-strewn race at a treacherously wet Interlagos emphasised the gulf between the two men. Rosberg takes a 12-point lead to the Yas Marina circuit and to clinch his first world title needs to finish only third there even if Hamilton wins. Statistically, there is not much to choose between the two Mercedes drivers this season - they have nine wins each; Hamilton has 11 poles and Rosberg eight. But on days like Sunday in Brazil, there is no doubt who is the great driver and who the very good one. Hamilton was in a league of his own in conditions of extreme difficulty, untouchable even by an inspired Max Verstappen. The world champion was the only driver the television cameras did not catch making a mistake of one sort or another, all while driving at a speed beyond the reach of his rivals. How many goals have England scored across Hamilton's 50 wins? Rosberg drove a very solid race, and survived one scary moment when he very nearly stuck the car in the wall accelerating through the kinks early in the pit straight. Had he not held that, the race would have seen the big turnaround in points that Hamilton needed to get properly back into the title race. As it is, he will almost certainly need a mechanical problem on Rosberg's car in Abu Dhabi to win a fourth world title. Another Hamilton masterclass When Hamilton gets over the immediate euphoria of finally winning the Brazilian Grand Prix, where his childhood hero Ayrton Senna was held as some sort of demigod by the local populace, he may curse the fact that the crazy race he needed finally arrived but Rosberg managed to negotiate his way through it. But for now, Hamilton will doubtless be revelling in his superiority. Adding up the gaps he built over Rosberg in this staccato race that veered between tedium and extreme drama, it comes to 36 seconds in total. Or half a second a lap on average. His real advantage was possibly even bigger than that, at least if we are to judge by the 18.5-second lead he established in the 15 racing laps before the final safety car period. It's never easy but I didn't have any mistakes for sure, Hamilton said. When you make mistakes it really hurts and I was more focused than ever and there was never going to be a moment I made a mistake. Hamilton v Rosberg: title permutations To win this, it has been a grand prix I have always wanted to win since I watched Ayrton win here in 1991. It has taken me a long time to get here and it is a historic day for me. To stand on the podium in Brazil where Ayrton was so loved was really special. On days like this, it is in some ways hard to believe that Rosberg, not Hamilton, is likely to be world champion this year. This is, in large part, down to the off-set in the reliability records between the two. While Hamilton has had three engine failures affect his points total, including the one while he was leading in Malaysia which will probably turn out to be fatal to his title hopes, Rosberg's season has been virtually trouble-free. Lewis Hamilton says he will 'take it like a man' if Nico Rosberg wins title The German's only technical problems have been a gearbox glitch in Silverstone that ended up dropping him from second to third and a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change in Austria, which ended up hurting him not at all the way the strategy played out."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":630,"title":"Brazilian GP: Has Max Verstappen joined the greats with stunning drive?","class":1,"body":"More than 900 Formula 1 races have been held since 1950, yet very few are rooted in the collective consciousness of fans. Monaco 1984 is one, so is Donington 1993. Then there's Barcelona 1996, Silverstone 2008 and Nurburgring 1968. All wet-weather races. All exceptional. Mention these grands prix to F1 devotees and they will nod approvingly, because these were occasions when a driver delivered something remarkable that marked him out as a cut above his peers. In the case of Brazil 2016, we may well have another entry to that list - and the man responsible was a 19-year-old named Max Verstappen. We witnessed something very special, Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said of his driver. The way he drove was outstanding. It stands out to me like Ayrton Senna in Monaco and other great drives in history. High praise indeed for a man occupying the third step of a podium. What was so great about this drive? Verstappen dropped to 16th after a pit stop with 16 laps to go but fought back to finish on the podium in treacherous wet conditions. Yet his drive was about more than this late climb through the field. He also overtook Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen early on and produced a superb pass on Mercedes' Nico Rosberg to take second place midway through the race. He would have finished there, behind winner Lewis Hamilton, had Red Bull not put him on intermediate tyres at a crucial point. The decision turned out to be an error and Verstappen had to pit again for extreme wet tyres, prompting his climb back. He also rescued a huge spin on the pit straight, preventing the car from hitting the wall and managing to hold on to second. He said it was 50-50 between skill and luck. Horner said: His move earlier in the race on Rosberg was brave, skilful and totally courageous and later in the race the inter tyre looked like the tyre to be on. We could see others starting to go quicker and we took the gamble and then the rain just intensified slightly, particularly around Turn 12. We had to abort that and fit a new set of extreme and then it was over to Max. How did Verstappen's late charge play out? Verstappen looked completely out of the picture when he pitted under the safety car for extreme wet tyres late on. But Red Bull knew what their man was capable of, and so did he. Can you make your way through the field on full wets? came the question from the pit wall. Verstappen said he could and dived in for fresh boots. What followed was hugely impressive, to say the least. The midfield runners were swiftly dispatched and, within a couple of laps, Verstappen was up to 12th place. That became 11th when he passed the Williams of Valtteri Bottas, while team-mate Daniel Ricciardo had no answer either as the teenager moved back into the points. Listen: Verstappen grabs third with daring overtake Daniil Kvyat was next, then Esteban Ocon's Manor and the Sauber of Felipe Nasr. Nico Hulkenberg? No problem. Sebastian Vettel? Done in a few corners. Verstappen even rudely ran the Ferrari off the track for good measure. Carlos Sainz was his next victim as he moved into fourth, and then came the podium-clinching move on Sergio Perez - a gutsy, around-the-outside pass at Turn 10 that he completed in Turn 11 having corrected a big slide on his way through. The Mercedes were too far up the road to do anything about, but Verstappen had made his point. Thirteen places made up in 16 laps. Job done. It was a lot of fun, with some scary moments, Verstappen said. I was a bit disappointed after the last pit stop, but I kept my head down and just kept pushing and I went for it. To come back on to the podium was amazing."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":631,"title":"India v England: Tourists need correct mindset - Jonathan Agnew","class":1,"body":"England will know it was a first-innings batting calamity that set the wheels in motion for India's 246-run win in the second Test in Visakhapatnam. To be 80-5 and give away a 200-run lead is a problem in any Test, let alone one where you know the pitch is going to get more difficult to bat on later in the match. However, for as tricky as the surface became - and some deliveries did do a lot - there were too many dismissals in England's second innings in particular that were not down to the pitch. The tourists were shown the way initially by Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow in the first innings, then by opening pair Alastair Cook and Haseeb Hameed in the second. Yet, English collapses - Michael Vaughan has referred to a little disease when panic appears to set in - were common. Four wickets for 29 runs and then four wickets for 30 runs in the first innings, eight wickets for 68 runs on the final day. It ultimately comes down to a batsman's state of mind. When you get a difficult delivery or the ball misbehaves, it can be very hard to put that out of your thoughts, but that is what the very best are able to do. The ability to clear your mind and focus on the next delivery is a skill my Test Match Special colleague Geoffrey Boycott speaks of so often. So it seems that the next three Tests in this series will be about England's mindset. Can they play every ball on its merits? Can they keep their chins up if they lose the toss? Can they be positive without being reckless? Can they remember that they have played some good cricket? Do they believe that they can beat India? The answers to those questions are not straightforward because India is such a difficult place to tour. We knew from the start that playing five matches here straight after two in Bangladesh was going to be difficult in terms of managing morale and keeping spirits high. England do not have to look too far into the past for inspiration. They came from behind to win here four years ago. Going further into the past, the 1984-85 tour led by David Gower that I was part of was a real success because the togetherness of the team helped us overcame everything that was thrown at us. Indira Gandhi, the prime minister, was assassinated hours after the touring party arrived. The UK's deputy high commissioner Percy Norris later suffered the same fate, a day after hosting a reception for the England team. England stayed out there despite fears the tour would be cancelled, then lost the first Test because of some questionable umpiring. Yet, England came back to win that series 2-1 and that is the mindset that the class of 2016 have to adopt. If they can, India can be beaten because we have already seen that these are two evenly matched sides. The hosts' only advantage is they have greater experience playing in these conditions. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, the world's leading Test wicket-taker this year, does not look too frightening when conditions are not in his favour. The same can be said for his partner in crime Ravindra Jadeja. These are bowlers that can be handled. India also have plenty of batsmen yet to register runs. Openers KL Rahul and Murali Vijay both need a score, as do Ajinkya Rahane and wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha. Yes, Cheteshwar Pujara is in good form and captain Virat Kohli was in stellar touch in Visakhapatnam - he scored 248 runs and the winning margin was 246, so imagine the boon it would be for England if they can remove him cheaply. Reaction: Vaughan blames batting collapse on 'little disease' TMS podcast: Agnew and Boycott review the second Test Not that the tourists do not have personnel issues of their own. Ben Duckett, who has made only 18 runs in three innings, looks very unlikely to play in the third Test in Mohali. England got into a muddle by not opening the batting with Hameed in Bangladesh and now both Gary Ballance and Duckett have failed at number four. The next available option appears to be Jos Buttler, one of the most exciting limited-overs players in the world. Is he the answer in the top order of a Test line-up against the spinning ball? We just do not know. Add to that the fact Buttler has played only one first-class match in the past year and there will be a lot of pressure on him if he is chosen to play in the next Test. Anyone saying with certainty that Buttler is the cavalry to solve England's problems is making a very big statement. Spinner Zafar Ansari is another who looks set to miss out on playing in the third Test. He may well have been left out anyway in order for England to play a fourth pace bowler, but he had a poor time with both ball and bat in Visakhapatnam. Those two aside, the other players that England have used in this series will all feel good. Cook, Hameed, Joe Root, Moeen Ali, Stokes and Bairstow have all made runs. Adil Rashid is really looking the part as a Test spin bowler, James Anderson has made an excellent return from injury and Chris Woakes will be raring to go after being rested for the second Test. The only question England will have is over the fitness of Stuart Broad, who returned his best bowling figures in India with a strained tendon in his foot. India can be beaten and England certainly have the ability. Do they have the mentality."}

He said: It has been an incredibly difficult decision but one that I felt I had to make at this stage. Scotland head coach Grant Bradburn described it as a big loss. South Africa-born Mommsen led Scotland at the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and the 2016 World Twenty20 in India. He scored two hundreds and six half-centuries in ODIs, where he averaged 32.38 with the bat, and was named ICC Associate and Affiliate Cricketer of the Year in 2014. His best form came in the 2014 World Cup qualifier in New Zealand, where he hit 520 runs at an average of 86.66 during the tournament, including 139 in Scotland's victory over the United Arab Emirates in the final. Mommsen was also the first to captain Scotland to victory in a global tournament when they beat Hong Kong at the World T20. Above all, we are very happy for Preston to be offered such an exciting opportunity, added Bradburn. Preston is intelligent, well respected and ambitious, so for him to be moving into a corporate field that he is passionate about is just brilliant, but he offers the team many qualities that will be difficult to replace. A quality experienced batsmen at the peak of his skills, consistently our fittest player, top fielder and, of course, our leader with a tough uncompromising attitude. Cricket Scotland chief executive Malcom Cannon also praised Mommsen's contribution. Preston has been an exemplary ambassador for the sport in this country and should be extremely proud of his achievements as captain of Scotland, he said.

That's the question we posed to users of the BBC Sport website, on the eve of Alastair Cook breaking Michael Atherton's record for the most Tests as captain of England. Cook has now led his country 55 times, but is he the best? You've been voting for your top five for almost a week, and there's a very clear winner... England's greatest Test captain is... Mike Brearley appeared in 82% of the 55,000 lists submitted, and was ranked number one in 41% of them. Michael Vaughan was the only other captain to be top of more than 20% of your rankings. Based on your selections, the five best England Test captains of all time are (in ranking order): Mike Brearley (1977-1981 - P31, W18, L4; Win percentage 58.06%) Michael Vaughan (2003-2008 - P51, W26, L11; Win percentage 50.98%) Andrew Strauss (2006-2012 - P50, W24, L11; Win percentage 48%) Alastair Cook (2010-present - P55, W24, L18; Win percentage 43.63%) Douglas Jardine (1931-1934 - P15, W9, L1; Win percentage 60%) Why Brearley? Perhaps it is no surprise a man who authored a book titled 'The Art of Captaincy' came out on top. Brearley, now 74, averaged only 23 with the bat in Test cricket and never scored a century - but his ability to mould a team and inspire them to success marked him out. Indeed, Australia fast bowler Rodney Hogg once said Brearley has a degree in people. The Englishman's greatest moment came during the 1981 Ashes series against Australia. England, under the leadership of all-rounder Sir Ian Botham, lost the first Test and drew the second. Brearley stepped up for the third and engineered a quite remarkable turnaround in which England recovered from 135-7 following on to win the Test. Botham was the catalyst in the middle, and the momentum shift saw England win the series in style by triumphing in the next two Tests. Brearley took England and Botham from one of their lowest points to arguably their most famous victory in the space of a few days. Vaughan, who won back the Ashes in 2005 after 18 years in Australian hands, was a clear second. He actually appeared in marginally more top fives than Brearley, but was ranked number one only 24% of the time. Continuing the theme of Ashes-winning captains, Andrew Strauss, who engineered victory in Australia in 2009-10, was third and Alastair Cook fourth. Fifth place was less clear. Douglas Jardine, who masterminded the revolutionary and controversial Bodyline tactics in 1933-34, was picked by 40% of respondents, with 5% having him top. Yorkshire's Brian Close, statistically England's most successful captain with a win percentage of 86% in seven Tests, was first choice for 8% of people. However, the fact he polled 4% less of the overall vote than Jardine saw him narrowly lose out on a place in the top five."}

The 19-year-old, only the second teenager to make his debut for England since 1949, played beautifully for his 82 in the second innings. Some are saying we should not build him up too soon, or put too much pressure on his shoulders, but you cannot ignore the fact he can bat. He has enormous potential, and whether he succeeds or fails is now entirely up to him. Naturally, he will have disappointments along the way and he will have to deal with them because they are part of international sport. Read the report from England's drawn first Test Listen to Test Match Special's chat with the Hameed family However, in terms of the four year search for an opener to partner Cook that England have been on since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012, Hameed looks to be far and away the best of the 10 candidates we have seen. The Lancashire teenager has a really good technique. He remains side on, he leaves studiously, has very good footwork and looks to have excellent judgement. Put simply, he looks like an opening batsman. As an old fast bowler, I look for holes in a batsman's method. For example, when it comes to Alex Hales, the man who opened with Cook for much of 2016, you could see he was a candidate to be caught at second slip. So it proved. With Hameed, there are no such obvious flaws. It looks like he is going be good enough to score a lot of runs for England. Haseeb Hameed in numbers Hameed has been with Lancashire since the age of nine This summer, he became the first Lancashire player to score two centuries in a County Championship match against Yorkshire In doing so, the 19-year-old became the youngest player to make two hundreds in an English first-class game Hameed scored 1,198 championship runs in 2016 at an average of 49.91 He entered the International Cricket Council's Test batting rankings at 64 after making 31 and 82 for England in the first Test against India Before this series began, there were two main areas of concern for England. Would they get enough runs? Would their spinners be good enough to trouble India's batsmen? In this first Test, on top of Hameed's emergence, four England batsmen made centuries, while England's slow bowlers more than matched their Indian counterparts. Captain Cook, with the benefit of three spinning options, used them in much shorter spells. Moeen Ali in particular seems to operate better in those circumstances. On top of that, Adil Rashid put in his best performance in a Test, picking up seven wickets. The Yorkshire leg-spinner spun the ball hard and used his very good googly, one which batsmen find difficult to read. While England were, at times, outstanding, India were well below par. They dropped three catches in the first half-an-hour of the match, their fielding in general was sloppy and their attempt to save the game on the final afternoon was rather eccentric. People might say they were complacent, but that does not disguise the fact they were four wickets away from being embarrassed. They have to go away and think between now and the beginning of the second Test on Thursday, when I'm sure any complacency will be rubbed out. If that is the case, England can expect a hard contest in Visakhapatnam. That venue, on the east coast, is likely to produce a pitch that is much more awkward for England. Commentators and former India players I have been talking to suggest it could be a really tricky, spinning pitch. If that is the case, it is every man for himself. You do what you have to do to cling on. Having said that, England must not panic or be put off. They should rely on the basics, know that every run is critical. The bowlers will have to keep it tight, the fielders will have to grab every half chance that comes their way and the batsmen will have to give India nothing at all. This surface in Rajkot was decent and, for a large proportion of the match, did not provide great assistance to the bowlers. In those conditions, England showed that they can compete. It might just provide India with the urgency to produce something England are not quite so comfortable with."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":636,"title":"Heather Knight column: Caribbean success, nachos and London Underground posters","class":1,"body":"After victory in the Caribbean, captain Heather Knight's England side are on the brink of clinching qualification for next summer's home World Cup as they head to Sri Lanka. We've had just over a week in the UK following our five-match one-day international series in the West Indies, which was a really good tour for us as a group. We were successful on the field, finishing with a strong win to take the series 3-2, but we also learned an awful lot as well. As a batting unit especially, scoring runs was not easy out there on slow, sticky pitches that turned inconsistently. Sometimes it can test your mental game as much as your technical game - you know it's going to be tough and that some balls are going to spin past the bat, but you've still got to try to be positive and find a method to score. Throughout the first four matches, there appeared to be a formula in play - win the toss, bat first, win the game - but we managed to buck the trend in the last match to register the first victory of the series for the side batting second. That chase was anchored by a quality innings from Nat Sciver, which showed us all how far her game has matured over the past few years. We know she can play some seriously destructive shots, but the team needed her to be the rock on this occasion and that's exactly what she did. The Caribbean isn't an easy place to tour and win, so to come away with a series victory against the current ICC Women's World Twenty20 champions is a big achievement. At times we were a bit inconsistent, but we're a young group of players who are developing all the time and there's bound to be a few bumps in the road. Volleyball and nachos provide stern opposition Once the series finished we had an extra day in Jamaica before we flew home, so we managed to fit in a beach volleyball tournament, consisting of players, our management team, and the journos following the tour from the BBC and Sky Sports. A bit earlier in the tour, we also played a friendly game against the West Indies team, including live commentary from the hotel staff, and encouragement from a rowdy crowd of holidaying Brits in the pool. After starting dreadfully, we clawed our way back into the match to finish with an epic victory thanks to Danni Wyatt's serves. Technically a 4-2 series win in the Caribbean then?! WATCH: Danni Wyatt's West Indies tour diary The following day we headed to the airport to fly home, although former England star Lydia Greenway, who was out with BBC Test Match Special to cover the matches, nearly missed the flight trying to finish off this never-ending bowl of nachos at the airport (she didn't even get a sixth of the way through!). Off to Abu Dhabi - and Sri Lanka It has been a quick turnaround before we venture overseas again to Abu Dhabi for a week-long training camp, before our four-match series against Sri Lanka in Colombo. We're taking a squad of 23 to Abu Dhabi so we can have some internal games out there, meaning a number of the England Women's Senior Academy girls are joining up with the main squad. It's a great opportunity for some of the youngsters to show what they can do, and benchmark where they are in comparison with the team. It will also be great preparation for us before heading onto Sri Lanka, for the final round of the ICC Women's Championship (ICCWC) as after taking four points in Jamaica, we now need just one more win from the three ICCWC matches in Colombo to secure our spot in the Women's World Cup on home soil next summer. Going Underground... Excitement is already building for the World Cup next year, especially with the ICC launching a ticket ballot for the final at Lord's on 23 July for the first time. It's been great to see lots of publicity and hopefully everyone getting behind it. Living in London, I got a slight shock on the Tube when I got back from the West Indies to see my ugly mug staring back at me on the platform in one of the adverts. A very weird experience, and my mates wouldn't let me get away without a spoof photo."}

The 29-year-old, one of seven Scotland-based full-time professionals, has featured in 42 one-day internationals and 24 Twenty20 internationals. He said: It has been an incredibly difficult decision but one that I felt I had to make at this stage. Scotland head coach Grant Bradburn described it as a big loss. South Africa-born Mommsen led Scotland at the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and the 2016 World Twenty20 in India. He scored two hundreds and six half-centuries in ODIs, where he averaged 32.38 with the bat, and was named ICC Associate and Affiliate Cricketer of the Year in 2014. His best form came in the 2014 World Cup qualifier in New Zealand, where he hit 520 runs at an average of 86.66 during the tournament, including 139 in Scotland's victory over the United Arab Emirates in the final. Mommsen was also the first to captain Scotland to victory in a global tournament when they beat Hong Kong at the World T20. Above all, we are very happy for Preston to be offered such an exciting opportunity, added Bradburn. Preston is intelligent, well respected and ambitious, so for him to be moving into a corporate field that he is passionate about is just brilliant, but he offers the team many qualities that will be difficult to replace. A quality experienced batsmen at the peak of his skills, consistently our fittest player, top fielder and, of course, our leader with a tough uncompromising attitude. Cricket Scotland chief executive Malcom Cannon also praised Mommsen's contribution. Preston has been an exemplary ambassador for the sport in this country and should be extremely proud of his achievements as captain of Scotland, he said. He has raised the bar in the level of professionalism he has shown. Mommsen predicted that Scotland will continue to grow its presence on the global stage in the future."}

I'm sure in the next couple of weeks, or possibly a month or so, we will know what the form is there, Davis told BBC Sussex. He has moved home to Dublin and hasn't quite made that decision yet. Dublin-born left-hander Joyce joined Sussex from Middlesex in 2009 and captained the side from July 2012 until the end of the 2015 season. Meanwhile, Davis says he is keen to recruit more all-rounders to help their challenge in all three formats in 2017. The Division Two club announced the signing of South Africa international Stiaan van Zyl on Wednesday. Robin Martin-Jenkins left us a number of years ago and a replacement for him is key as it allows you balance the team, Davis said. It's not straightforward but the signing of Stiaan helps with that.

Nat Sciver (77) and Danielle Hazell (45) helped England recover from 58-6 to post 240-9 on Thursday before rain forced the game into a reserve day. Laura Marsh took 4-21, including her 100th ODI wicket, and Hazell 3-21 as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 78. England secured qualification for the 2017 World Cup in the second ODI. It was nice, in the face of a potential collapse, to turn it around and win, captain Heather Knight said. We've had a really good year and I think the girls are really starting to take responsibility and grow into their roles. Who else has made the World Cup? New Zealand guaranteed World Cup qualification with a seven-wicket defeat of Pakistan in Nelson on Thursday - joining Australia and England in next year's tournament, which will be held in England in June and July. The fourth and final automatic place is between West Indies and India - and will depend on how the International Cricket Council rules on an unplayed series. With every team expected to play each other over a two-year period, a scheduled series between Pakistan and India - due to take place before the end of October - did not happen, and looks unlikely to do so for political reasons. If the six available points from that series are shared, fourth-placed West Indies would finish above India as they have recorded the most wins of the pair. The Windies would also stay fourth if Pakistan, as the home side, are awarded the points because of the Indian board's perceived reluctance to play them. The fifth-placed side will join South Africa, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and six other teams in Sri Lanka early next year, to play a final qualifier for the last four places in the World Cup."}

{"id":642,"title":"India v England: Michael Vaughan blames batting collapse on 'little disease'","class":1,"body":"England must eradicate the little disease in the dressing room if they are to avoid the collapses that cost them in the second Test defeat by India, says ex-captain Michael Vaughan. They slipped to 80-5 while conceding a crucial first-innings deficit of 200 in Visakhapatnam, and lost their last eight wickets for 66 runs on the final day as India won by 246 runs. When they lose one wicket, a panic sets in. They can't stop it. It is a common trend, Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special. Somewhere the mentality has to change and someone has to do something about it. 'They go down like a pack of cards' England narrowly failed to force victory in the first Test of the five-match series in Rajkot after posting 537 and 260-3 declared. However, the drawn Test series in Bangladesh that preceded the India tour was marked by batting collapses. They were 21-3 and 62-5 in the first and second innings respectively in Chittagong, then slumped to 69-5 in the first innings in Dhaka, where they subsided from 100-0 to 164 all out in the second innings as Bangladesh claimed a maiden Test win over England. They have a habit of collapsing, said former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott on TMS. They go down like a pack of cards, like dominoes. This pitch is not a minefield. As soon as a wicket went, they're fraught. Captain Alastair Cook said England's first-innings collapse in Visakhapatnam, when five wickets fell on the second evening, proved crucial. In India you've got to score first-innings runs. You can't afford to lose a session, he said. If you get behind the game in India, it's very difficult to get back. 'We'll hold our heads high' India wrapped up victory - their second biggest over England in terms of runs - by bowling the tourists out for 158 shortly after lunch on the final day. The 97.3 overs England faced was their third longest fourth innings in a Test in India. Cook, who shared a 75-run opening stand in 50 overs with teenager Haseeb Hameed on Sunday, said: We'll hold our heads up high. We set our stall out in the fourth innings and we made India work very hard. However, India captain Virat Kohli, named man of the match after making 167 and 81, said: Scoring runs in between puts some pressure on the bowlers. It is a basic thing. If you don't have that intent in the fourth innings, it is tough to play out four and a half sessions. Should Duckett be dropped? Ben Duckett made five and nought in Visakhapatnam - dismissed twice by off-spinner Ravinchandran Ashwin - and has failed to pass 15 in six of his seven Test innings since making his debut in Bangladesh. He could make way for wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler, who has played only one first-class match in 13 months, for the third Test in Mohali which starts on Saturday. I'm more than comfortable with Jos playing as a batter, England coach Trevor Bayliss told Sky Sports. Young Duckett is a young batter with a lot of potential. He's just going through a bit of a period at the moment where he's not scoring any runs. Cook told TMS: There's a lot of talk about his technique about defending spin and he's aware of that. It's another hurdle that an international player, under the scrutiny, you have got to handle. We have to give him all the support we can. Vaughan, who captained England in 51 of his 82 Tests, said: The only option is Jos Buttler. Duckett looks shot facing Ashwin - he looked like a rabbit in the headlights. He needs a little breather to work out that technique against the spinners. Boycott added: His head has gone. When you are under severe stress like he is, he's trying to force it. I would give him a break from Test cricket. Former England batsman Mark Butcher told BBC 5 live Sport: The problem he is having is clear for all to see. He'll be trying to do something about it but unfortunately [Ravichandran] Ashwin has got his number. You just want to crawl in a hole when that happens to you. When it happens at the very beginning of your career - before you have bought yourself some credit in the eyes of your team-mates or in the eyes of the public - it becomes very difficult and is almost suffocating at times."}

Former England and Lions centre Jeremy Guscott, fresh from being inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame this week, analyses the action. All Black ferocity World champions New Zealand play everything at an incredible intensity. They understand the laws of the game, where the boundaries are and how the referee might react. They use it to their advantage. But on Saturday Ireland couldn't beat a side who were playing with 14 men for 20 minutes. You have to say they should have won the game. Referees need to look harder at New Zealand - their speed and intensity means the game moves so quickly, but they are canny. The All Blacks have to watch their high tackles - they have got a reputation for it and have had two players cited from Saturday - but for all that, you can't blame the players. I'm not one who thinks their players go out there to hurt anyone illegally, they are sportsmen and do their best. There is ferocity in everything they do and they take everything to the limit, but it is up to the referee to be better at seeing and penalising them. There are a few incidents everyone is talking about from the game, mainly the high tackle by Sam Cane on Robbie Henshaw. Your view of how that decision went depended on what side of the equator you are on. If Cane had been sin-binned you could not have argued. For me, what determined that was a yellow card was that it was shoulder first. His left arm seemed to be angled behind his shoulder and he hit Henshaw's head. The bigger argument is, would it have made a difference to the game? New Zealand had two yellow cards in the game and Ireland did not take advantage as well as they did two weeks ago, when they beat the All Blacks for the first time in 111 years of trying. They could not get across the line in Dublin. A couple of tries really did go begging - that is the difference when playing a team with New Zealand's class between winning and losing. Ireland showed you can't make any mistakes and have to take every chance."}

His goal is to see in my lifetime one of the Pacific Island teams win the Rugby World Cup. In rugby terms, the Pacific Islands commonly refers to Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, who are all inside the top 15 in World Rugby's rankings. The Fiji side that faces England at Twickenham this Saturday will have a familiar look to those who follow Premiership rugby.

Of the 70-plus players of Pacific Island heritage in the Premiership, six are in the England squad, while it's estimated that 18% of all professional rugby union players worldwide are of Pacific Island heritage; a remarkable statistic considering the combined population of Samoa, Tonga and Fiji is a little over one million people. Leo established the Rugby Players' Association Cultural Diversity Programme in August, and works with the 72 players of Samoan, Fijian or Tongan heritage who operate in the Premiership, providing advice on a variety of social and financial issues. The programme is about increasing communication at all levels, the former Wasps lock explained. Our [Pacific Island] cultures are very indirect and hierarchical. It would be very disrespectful to ask questions of those in authority, like coaches.

Young players can sometimes have a great first game because adrenaline takes them through it but they must back it up. You look at Watson, he's really backed-up what he did against Australia. And our front-row have had to tough it out against some of the best in the world and come through it and learned. You always want to play your best team, but you hardly ever get a chance - there's always an injury somewhere. When you look at the guys that have come through, it's been a massive tick of the box. All of a sudden it brings competition, you've got players that may be injured or not in the team thinking, 'hang on a minute, there's somebody now not that far behind me'. We haven't got a massive player pool in this country - that's not an excuse, it's just reality - so you have to do the best you can with the players you've got. Fly-half Finn Russell missed two late drop-goal attempts with the scores locked at 16-16, before Laidlaw's decisive goal. Russell admits he should have made the kicks count, but says the win provides vital impetus against an improving Georgia. It was a bit of a relief getting the win after a tough game, but it was good to grind that one out, get the scrum and hold our composure, go through the phases and get the penalty, said Russell. If we'd have come off that pitch with a loss or a draw, we'd have been disappointed. It makes a big difference for our momentum going into Georgia, and previously Scotland could've lost that game, but the composure we showed, and the way we played that game, and the last couple of minutes was great. I probably should have kicked both of the drop-kicks - but I knew Greig was going to kick that last penalty; we kept the crowd on their toes."}

South Africa have locks Pieter-Steph du Toit, Lood de Jager and Franco Mostert in their squad, with Coetzee adding: There are also some utility forwards who can provide extra cover if needed. Wales are attempting to win three autumn internationals for the first time since 2002 after narrow wins over Argentina and Japan. However, the nature of those wins and the 32-8 hammering by Australia have drawn criticism in Wales.

Fly-half Sexton picked up a 'minor' hamstring injury in the bruising weekend defeat by New Zealand while centre Henshaw suffered concussion. Rob Kearney and CJ Stander also sustained concussion and are doubtful. Ireland have added Ulster centre Stuart Olding and Munster's Rory Scannell to the squad as cover. Henshaw was knocked unconscious by a shoulder contact to his jaw following a tackle by New Zealand flanker Sam Cane and had to be carried off with his neck in a brace after only 10 minutes. All Blacks duo cited Cane, and team-mate Malakai Fekitoa, were cited after the game and face disciplinary hearings on Tuesday for allegedly dangerous tackles. Sexton was forced off soon after Henshaw as Ireland suffered a 21-9 loss two weeks after they beat the All Blacks for the first time in 111 years. Full-back Kearney developed concussive symptoms after the match and he will follow the return to play protocols along with Stander with a view to deciding their involvement against the Wallabies. Simon Zebo (cramp) and Tadhg Furlong (dead leg) are expected to recover in time to face Michael Cheika's side.

Blood was pouring out of my chest and I thought 'this is it'. On a foggy, cold and grey morning in Leeds, former Royal Marine and now rugby league referee Jack Smith describes the moment he came to terms with death six years earlier. He was shot by a Taliban sniper while serving in Afghanistan on 21 August, 2010. The bullet passed through his lower back, breaking ribs, hitting his liver, gall bladder, spleen, diaphragm and right lung before exiting his upper chest. Lying flat on a roof at the time, he quickly rolled off the building to avoid further fire and broke even more ribs on impact. You lay there, your body shuts down and you don't think rationally, he said. You think 'I'm going to sleep and that'll be it'. Looking back, if someone says 'you lay there and think you are going to die' you would think you would have some emotion. But with your body shutting down you really don't think about anything, you just want to close your eyes and go to sleep. It was 21 days later in Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital that he opened his eyes. For him, it was a blink in time. He awoke with family by his side and questioned why they were in Afghanistan. I just didn't get it. It took me four or five days to get my head around it, said the 27-year-old."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":657,"title":"How Matthew Fitzpatrick & Tyrrell Hatton can keep British golf on top","class":1,"body":"Compared with many modern sportsmen Matthew Fitzpatrick maintains modest motoring standards, but there is no doubting his place in the fast lane to golfing success. The personable 22-year-old from Sheffield is now unquestionably Britain's brightest young talent in the men's game, following last Sunday's thrilling triumph in the DP World Tour Championship. And the same can be said of 20-year-old Charley Hull, who claimed the women's Tour Championship title with her maiden LPGA triumph in Florida. A final round 66 secured a two-stroke victory that will surely have a springboard effect on the Northamptonshire player's already highly promising young career. Fitzpatrick is at the vanguard of a crop of homegrown men's talent ready to muscle in at the top of the sport. The list also includes High Wycombe's Tyrell Hatton, who Fitzpatrick pipped to the season-ending crown. And so, two years to the day after he earned his European Tour card, Fitzpatrick was able to celebrate his third title, following successes at the 2015 British Masters and this year's Nordea Masters. He is the youngest Englishman to achieve a hat-trick of Tour wins, surpassing Sir Nick Faldo's record, which was set at the start of what proved the greatest British career in the modern era. Fitzpatrick, who was driving a Ford Mondeo at the time of his debut win, turned his back on offers to drive flashier models as his career began to blossom because they might be targeted by thieves. So, I've got a very nice BMW 3 Series, he smiled in the wake of his Dubai triumph which, with a bonus for finishing sixth in the Race to Dubai, netted him around £1.3m. There is a sense that the riches flowing his way are unlikely to turn Fitzpatrick's head. Despite his apparent youthful innocence, this former US Amateur Championship winner has honed a steely determination. It has helped make him a formidable competitor, surely capable of challenging for the game's biggest prizes. Sensibly, he has eschewed overtures from the leading club manufacturers to be able to use the equipment of his choice. It has meant he has been able to stick with the putter that has proven so reliable through his fledgling career. With no contractual obligations to fulfil, he has also been able to swap drivers in recent weeks and arrived upon one that gave him the extra yardage that is so vital on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates. Despite popular perceptions, this relatively slight figure has been growing in stature off the tee in recent times. In the past three months, I have been working very hard in the gym, Fitzpatrick said. And that has paid off as well. 'I wouldn't be here without them' At the heart of his success, though, lies his relationship with the extraordinary English coaching combination of Mike Walker and Pete Cowen. They have just won the Order of Merit with Henrik Stenson and myself winning and [Masters winner] Danny Willett was in the running, Fitzpatrick added. Obviously I'm very biased, but I think they are the best coaches in the world for multiple reasons. Not just for teaching the golf game but just general life coaching as well. I wouldn't be here without them; not playing this standard of golf, anyway. Stenson, who has just won his second Race to Dubai and is coached by Walker and Cowen, concurred. I think that's a big part of his success, he said. Of course, it is down to how hard he has worked and his talent, but also the help that we get along the way. The Swede, who is celebrating his second Race to Dubai title, partnered Fitzpatrick in the foursomes at this year's Ryder Cup. The last 15 months have been phenomenal for him, Stenson said. He's got big potential, of course. He's not playing the power game, but he's hitting a lot of fairways, a lot of greens and putting well and he has a solid short game. So he is going to be around for a while, that's for sure. 'We'll push each other forward' All the signs suggest Hatton is on a similarly upward trajectory. The 25-year-old winner of October's Alfred Dunhill Links Championship came desperately close to a second title in Dubai as he and Fitzpatrick dominated the final day. It's exciting moving forward and hopefully there will be many more occasions like this, Hatton told BBC Sport. There are a few lads that are doing really well at the moment and I'm sure in the years to come that we'll be pushing each other forward. Two such players, Chris Wood, 28, and Andy Sullivan, 30, represent England in this week's World Cup at Melbourne's magnificent Kingston Heath layout. Scotland's Russell Knox, 31, is also there and these are some of the players taking over from the generation of Lee Westwood, Luke Donald and Ian Poulter. With Rory McIlroy, still only 27 and at number two in the world, there is plenty of cause for optimism for UK golf. Don't be surprised if Fitzpatrick soon hits further heights fuelled by confidence from his stellar Dubai triumph."}

The 27-year-old admits his 2016 major efforts were a disappointment in what he feels was otherwise a good season. McIlroy has also targeted Colin Montgomerie's money list record after watching Henrik Stenson succeed him as European number one on Sunday in Dubai. Next season I just need to make sure the majors match up to what I am doing outside of them, said McIlroy. McIlroy, who has four majors to his name, failed to genuinely threaten to add to that tally in the year's four biggest events. He recorded two top-10 finishes and two missed cuts in this year's majors and described his putting as pathetic after making an early exit from the US PGA for the first time in his career. My major championship performances haven't been what I wanted, but if you take the majors away I feel like I have played pretty well and had a good season, added the Tour Championship and overall FedEx Cup title winner. He relinquished his European number one status to Open champion Stenson at the season-ending DP World Tour event at Jumeirah Estates over the weekend. And the three-time European money list winner revealed he has the record eight titles of Scotsman Montgomerie in his sights. When you see someone do something you have done before and have not quite achieved this year, of course you want to do it again, said the Northern Irishman. I want to win the Race again, I have got a few more years and it would be nice to pass Monty. That will be a nice little target to aim for and hopefully I can get my fourth next year. I know if I win tournaments and play well in the big events that these things sort of happen in the process."}

Hull started the final round with a one-shot lead ahead and shot six birdies in her bogey-free round for a six-under-par 66 at the Florida course. It's wicked to do it at 20, she said. It feels good to be joining the winners this year. World number one Lydia Ko was tied for 10th, while England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff finished tied for 36th. Scotland's Catriona Matthew finished in 46th place. Hull had been tied with Ryu after 16, but the Korean missed her par putt on the 17th as Hull birdied the hole to take the lead and complete a two-shot swing. Both players then parred the last as Hull took the title, in the final tournament of the season. The world number 29, who finished seventh at the Rio Olympics, had a bogey-free weekend, with 12 birdies and 24 pars in her final 36 holes and wins $500,000 (£404,891) in prize money. I just feel pretty good where I am at the moment, added Hull. I feel like I am mentally good. I feel relaxed. I think that's the key for me. If I come into a week relaxed I feel good.

World number four Stenson was 12 under and shared ninth place, regaining the European Tour crown he won in 2013. Fitzpatrick, 22, one behind overnight, birdied the last for a 67 to finish 17 under and win his third tournament. Tyrrell Hatton bogeyed the last for a 68 and was second, with overnight leader Victor Dubuisson four adrift. World number two Rory McIlroy, who needed to win the tournament and Stenson to be outside the top 45 to have any chance of winning the Race to Dubai for a third successive year, had seven birdies and an eagle in a closing 65 and also shared ninth. Sweden's Alex Noren, six strokes behind overnight, would have claimed the $1.25m bonus prize for winning the European Tour money list prize had he won the tournament, but he could only post a 71 and finished eight under. Masters champion Danny Willett needed at least a top-four finish to have any chance, but dropped to joint 51st place after a third-round 76, and he finished with a 70 to tie for 50th, 16 strokes off the pace. Fellow Englishman Hatton, who secured his first European Tour victory at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews last month, looked set for another when he holed a bunker shot for a par at the 17th to retain a one-shot lead. But his final drive found the stream meandering through the 18th fairway and he took six. Fitzpatrick, however, who made his Ryder Cup debut this year, played a masterful shot from a greenside bunker at the last and then holed a breaking putt from four feet for victory. The Sheffield golfer is now expected to move into top 30 and he said: It's happened so fast it's difficult to take in some of the time, but this week has been a special one.

{"id":662,"title":"Tiger Woods: What now after his latest setback?","class":1,"body":"So it is now a lack of form rather than fitness holding back Tiger Woods in his fight to compete for the first time since August last year. His withdrawal from this week's Safeway Open came as a shock, given his commitment to the event only last Friday. And his decision to skip the California tournament has prompted inevitable torrents of wild speculation over his future. Some are saying he is finished, others claim the 40-year-old is suffering stage fright. Respected Golf Channel pundit Brandel Chamblee suggests Woods is in a decline similar to the one suffered by Seve Ballesteros. And it is sad that such an iconic figure remains unable to compete after 14 months away from the game recovering from multiple back surgeries. But it does feel as though there is a considerable over-reaction to Woods' decision to miss the PGA Tour's season-opening tournament. So much unfounded speculation surrounds the 14-time major champion and this is compounded by his secretive ways which have spawned an industry in conspiracy theories. So let's try to look at the facts. The Safeway Open was the perfect tournament to target for his comeback. Woods owed an appearance to the event (previously known as the Frys.com Open) after being given a release to play in an exhibition event in Turkey four years ago. As PGA Tour events go, it is relatively low key and played on a straightforward course at the Silverado Resort. Woods has been getting stronger and felt he would be ready to play. When he officially entered the event last Friday, it was the PGA Tour rather than Woods' website that broke the news. This is a change from the norm and the player's reluctance to trumpet his return suggests doubts remained even while his entry forms were being signed. Another break from the Woods' modus operandi was his statement of September 7, when he outlined his intended comeback schedule. It is rare for him to detail his calendar but he identified Silverado, the Turkish Airlines Open and and his own World Challenge event in the Bahamas. Woods said he couldn't wait to compete again but added a significant caveat: My hope is to have my game ready to go.… It is now clear that his play is currently not of the requisite standard. He just didn't feel like his game was where he wanted it to be to be competitive, said his close friend Notah Begay. The former Tour pro, who acts as an unofficial spokesman for his illustrious mate, also suggested Woods has not been able to put in enough practice to make his game sharp enough. This could be because the player's recovering but aging body is not up to the intense range regimes of old or it might just mean he still has a long way to go to return to his former standards. Who knows? We can only speculate but what we do know is that such is his celebrity, he cannot make a quiet comeback. This week he would have played the pro-am with basketball star Steph Curry and was to be paired with Phil Mickelson for the first two rounds. Back in 1997 former tennis world number one Andre Agassi had fallen off the cliff in his career and needed to find a way back. His return began at an anonymous Challenger Event with a first prize of $7,200 and next to no-one watching. When Canadian golfer Graeme DeLaet underwent similar back surgery to Woods in 2011 he made his comeback at the rather understated Melwood Prince George's County Open. Woods does not have the option of a return away from the spotlight against players of a somewhat lesser standard. And wherever he comes back, he knows every shot will be analysed to the nth degree. It goes with the territory when you have been the planet's pre-eminent sportsman, but the stark reality is that he is now the world's 786th ranked golfer and it is a very long way back from such a position. This is not the first time he has taken himself out of the firing line. At the beginning of last year he suffered a bout of destructive chipping 'yips' as he missed the cut in Phoenix and withdrew mid-tournament at Torrey Pines the following week. That was in early February and we did not see Woods again until the Masters two months later. The media centre went on 'yip watch' from the moment the four-time champion strolled on to the Augusta practice range. Yet, on a course that puts the biggest demands on short-game sharpness, Woods delivered a polished display with his wedges and collected a creditable top 20 finish. This is a man who won a US Open on one leg back in 2008, his last major victory. If nothing else he is a fighter, as we saw with that extraordinary triumph. Now he is embroiled in a battle to save his career. Pulling out of the Safeway Open is an embarrassment but not the end. I will continue to strive to be able to play tournament golf, Woods insisted. I'm close, and I won't stop until I get there. On that he deserves to be believed."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":663,"title":"Duncan Stewart: The unknown Scot aiming to win golf's World Cup","class":1,"body":"There was quite a choice for Russell Knox, you'd have thought. Richie Ramsay or Martin Laird would surely have been worth consideration. How about Marc Warren? Or maybe Stephen Gallacher... Instead, Florida-based Knox chose someone he knew well to join him in the two-man Scotland team at the lucrative World Cup of Golf in Melbourne next month. Knox, as Scotland's highest-ranked player, sitting at 19th in the world, had the privilege of choosing his playing partner. In selecting Duncan Stewart, 309th in the rankings, he will have beside him on the Kingston Heath course not just someone who knows his game, but a friend from their days in the Highlands. We got together at the age of 13 or 14, Stewart, now 32, told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound. We played junior opens and played for the district together and from there we blossomed into good friends and hopefully good team-mates in November. Scotland's old pals' act Knox told the PGA Tour website that, whether the Scots win the World Cup or finish last, we're going to talk about this until we're dead. I feel like this has the potential to change Duncan's life, said Knox, a year younger than Edinburgh-based Stewart. I feel like he could easily be in my shoes and vice versa, and if he was in my shoes, he would've picked me. Stewart's career mirrored his friend's for a spell. Having been recommended to the coach by Knox, who was already ensconced Stateside, he left Grantown-on-Spey to join the Jacksonville University Dolphins golf team in Florida. Stewart showed the greater promise of the duo at that stage but it was after they graduated that their paths drifted. His dad's American and his parents moved over in 2005 to Jacksonville, said Stewart of Knox. I stayed out for half-a-year, three-quarters of a year after we graduated, maybe May 2008. Things didn't quite go my way so I decided to pursue it more in Europe. Driving...but not on the golf course Having turned pro in 2007, Stewart's career has since been on the brink of collapse as he struggled to make a living on the European Challenge Tour. From 2008 to 2012 he made less than £2,000 in prize money. Asked if he ever regretted coming back to Scotland, given the success of Knox in America, Stewart said: There's no right or wrong thing to do. I've got an amazing family at home and everything happens for a reason. In recent years he has supplemented his income by driving a delivery van. Last winter was bizarre, he continued. My son was born on 31 October and I didn't touch a club for over two months. I did it [driving a delivery van] the previous winter as well. It's not the most amazing money but at that time of year you're not playing tournaments; you've just got to do what you do to get by. Now everything's turned on its head. I went from possibly not playing again next year if things didn't go well this year, to things looking very good and the European Tour card is secured for next year. It's quite bizarre, really. I can't wait to get there and do Scotland proud. Knox, who just missed out on making the European team for the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine, and his old pal from Scotland's North District amateur team will be trying to emulate Colin Montgomerie and Marc Warren's World Cup win in 2007. A question of comfort Stewart sees no reason why he and Knox cannot win the tournament, which has an $8m prize fund, despite raised eyebrows over Knox opting for a lowly ranked team-mate. As Russell said, it was kind of an obvious choice for him, he said. He wanted somebody he was comfortable with and obviously I'm playing quite well this year, so it ticked all the boxes. Any time you get the chance to represent your country it is going to be massive. The big thing is we're very comfortable in each other's presence and comfortable in the format. If we can get comfortable straight away and playing well there's no reason why we can't go and win the World Cup for Scotland. Stewart's fortunes are on the up, though in golf terms his income is relatively modest. His biggest pay cheque to date is 24,750 euros for finishing tied for fourth at the Kazakhstan Open earlier this month. He spoke to BBC Radio Scotland from an airport runway in China. He had just earned 898 euros for being tied for 49th place at the Hainan Open, cut to two rounds because of poor weather. In the coming week, he competes in the Foshan Open, also in China. Looking ahead to the World Cup, Stewart said: Last place is $28,000 each. Regardless of what happens it's going to be a very good week. We are going to go there and enjoy it and hopefully the result will be good at the end of the week. If it's not, we're going to have a great time together and push on from it. On Thursday and Saturday it's alternate shot and Friday and Sunday's it's better ball. I think we've got a very good chance in that format. This will be the most pressure I've been under. Hopefully, with the season I've had and knowing I'm playing the European Tour next year I can really try to push on. It's going to be great."}

At Sunday's foundation board meeting in Glasgow, Wada announced that the second part of the independent report, compiled by Professor Richard McLaren, is to be released on 9 December. Sir Craig Reedie, who has been re-elected as Wada president for a second three-year term, said he was confident Wada was making progress with Russia. The facts are that the McLaren commission indicated that there had been breaches of the code involving the Moscow lab and the ministry of sport, said the 75-year-old Scot. To that extent, that's the scale of the issue we have to deal with. I'm really, really keen to move forward. We need to have Russia compliant. Wada also announced proposals to seek greater powers to impose sanctions, as well as a new whistleblower programme aimed at protecting and encouraging athletes or officials who seek to highlight doping. What we started today was a roadmap on compliance, added Reedie. People have been saying to us that non-serious compliance needs non-serious sanctions - and that serious non-compliance needs serious sanctions. There is quite clearly a feeling within the athlete community that this should be done. There is much work to be done. It will take massive consultation before we get to the finished article. The body said at its board meeting in Glasgow that people are still at risk from cyber-hackers who are trying to access athletes' medical records. A hacking group known as Fancy Bears has been releasing records of therapeutic use exemptions, which allow athletes to use otherwise-banned drugs because of a verified medical need."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":666,"title":"Sir Craig Reedie: World Anti-Doping Agency president fights on despite criticism","class":1,"body":"World Anti-Doping Agency president Sir Craig Reedie has insisted sport can recover from a dreadful period. Wada was heavily criticised by Olympic officials for its handling of the Russian doping scandal in the build-up to this summer's Rio Games. Reedie's future at the agency has been called into question just days before he stands for re-election. But the 75-year-old Briton told BBC Sport he would fight on as the integrity of sport is at stake. Tensions over Wada's attempt to get Russia banned from the Rio Olympics were laid bare at this week's general assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC). There was irritation from a number of national Olympic committees, said Reedie, who is also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Just before Rio they would rather sport had not been involved in accusations of the breaching of rules by the Russian authorities, and I understand that, so I had to deal with it and I did deal with it. IOC president Thomas Bach told BBC Sport this week he has no regrets about letting Russia compete at Rio 2016. But ANOC president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah - an influential powerbroker in the Olympic movement - has called for a neutral leader to take charge of Wada. Reedie is due to stand unopposed for a second three-year term at a Wada board meeting this weekend. He had been told he had the IOC's support. I've spent 15 years of my life working with Wada, he said. I don't think it's a particularly good idea if I walk away from it simply because it's getting difficult. We've been faced with a difficult situation. I think we're going to come through it, and we have to. The integrity of sport is at stake. The Olympic movement is bracing itself for the release next month of a second independent Wada report by professor Richard McLaren into Russian doping. His first report was damning, revealing a systematic cheating programme in the country across many sports. If, about three and a half years ago, when I was invited to apply [to be Wada president], somebody had told me this would have happened, it maybe isn't the kind of job that you would volunteer for, said Reedie. That having been said, there are serious issues involved here. The past has been pretty dreadful. I'm really hopeful that once we get the second part of the McLaren report out of the way, we can draw a line under the past and move forward. We have to get the Russian anti-doping agency properly compliant again and we need to look at what Wada is currently doing, and see if we can do it better. Wada's board meeting in Glasgow this weekend could be pivotal in the debate about how to better protect clean sport following the recent Russian scandal. Many within the anti-doping community want Wada to be strengthened, with greater independence and sanctioning power. However, the sports movement appears reluctant to hand Wada more authority, with Bach suggesting he wants a new Wada-run body to take on responsibility for testing as well as regulation.

{"id":667,"title":"Usain Bolt: What is the world's fastest man really like? ","class":1,"body":"Most people know that Usain Bolt is the fastest human on Earth. But most people have absolutely no idea how that feels. What is it like to command a frame of muscle and bone so perfectly conditioned that, at the bang of a starting pistol, you move so explosively that you leave the world behind? The remarkable thing about Bolt is that even his peers are not in a position to know. So what is it like to be Usain Bolt? And, as fast as the burst from his sprinters' blocks, the 30-year-old responds: Awesomeness. This is a man very comfortable in his own skin. Sitting in a restaurant he owns in Jamaica's capital Kingston, his home since he was 16 years old, the busy market streets and city noise reflect the media frenzy around his every move. Inside, everything is calm as he lopes slowly down the stairs. He allows his long, powerful body to adjust to the contours of a chair. How on earth does a man who is 6ft 5ins ever get out of the blocks? Staying motivated Bolt is here to talk about his documentary 'I A Bolt' - a behind-the-scenes look at his life and journey to superstardom. He wants it, above all, to inspire everyone to be the best they can possibly be. The hardest thing is to motivate yourself, he says. I talk to myself… especially when I'm in training and I don't want to do it anymore, I say 'If you wanna be a champion you gotta go, get up'. I say 'You're gonna lose. You don't wanna lose. So let's finish this'. The desire to motivate derives from the need to identify what every talented performer, especially someone as gifted as Bolt, hides: the sacrifices they make to reach their goals. People always say to me 'Usain, it looks so easy.' It's not easy... it's a lot of work, you just don't see it. And all the injuries and stress that I go through and what I'm thinking…. all these things I just want to share with the world. Back to Bolt's roots To really understand the world's fastest man, you have to leave Kingston and head to where it all began. There are a special few who have the ability to transcend their sports. Baseball's Babe Ruth, football's Pele, basketball's Michael Jordan and boxing's Muhammad Ali all come to mind. But how much did growing up in Pigtown, Bauru, Wilmington and Louisville have to do with the charismatic brilliance of their famous sons? The residents of the small village of Sherwood Content, hugged by wooded hills in the north of the island, are in no doubt: no Sherwood Content, no Usain Bolt the superstar. This secluded part of the countryside is three hours drive west of the capital but tracking down Bolt's Aunt Lilly isn't hard to do - she has 'Welcome Aunt Lilly' painted on the side of her house. She has a theory that the secret of her nephew's success is really down to her cooking. Breaking in and out of patois, she says that his speed comes from the yam, the dumpling and the pork... he's a man who really love food. Young Usain would pop by Lilly's house before going home from school or track events. No one listening to Lilly could fail to believe in the magical power of her meals. She never doubted that her nephew was special but we didn't know what was ahead of him. When asked about Bolt's unique 'triple triple' - winning three gold medals in three consecutive Olympics - she says: Well, I knew he would do it adding cos he said he was gonna do it. 'He was a sore loser' Bolt's sporting education began at Waldensia Primary School, a short walk from the house where his parents still live. His former teacher, Sheron Seivwright, points out that he always commanded attention. I don't know what his parents fed him on but he was quite energetic, could run very, very fast at his tender age, she says. Seivwright lives opposite the small, colourful school, a mural of Bolt in his famous 'lightning Bolt' pose is visible from her window. During Thursday 'games time', she remembers watching Bolt win races against older children. On the rare occasions someone beat him, he was a sore loser. She remembers: He would cry. Always cry. And I would rub his head and say 'no, man, you can't cry. One day you're gonna be a great runner'. When asked how she feels watching him race now, Seivwright's reserve falls away. Every time I hear his name or I see him run, [I get] goose pimples. I scream, I yell, I jump up and down. I can't believe he's such a great legend, a great hero. I'm so very, very proud, she says. And that's it: he is a world superstar, but Jamaica's champion. He's the man who not only brought them dancing, screaming, leap-up-and-down joy, but also unbridled, smiling pride. Back in the restaurant, I tell Bolt that a family member had told me that all the Bolts are superstars. He instinctively identifies my source, Auntie Lilly, I bet, adding, But yeah, we're cool people."}

The 33-year-old will go up against Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt and South Africa's 400m star Wayde van Niekerk. The women's award is between Ethiopia's 10,000m champion Almaz Ayana, Jamaican sprinter Elaine Thompson and hammer thrower Anita Wlodarczyk from Poland. The awards will be presented in Monaco on 2 December. The three athletes in each category were shortlisted from an original list of 10 announced last month following a vote of representatives from all sections of the sport and members of the public. Farah secured a historic 'double double' by retaining both his 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic titles in Rio. Bolt sealed the 'triple triple' in Rio, winning his third Olympic title in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay while Van Niekerk became the first man to run sub-10 seconds for the 100m, sub-20 for the 200m and sub-44 for the 400m, breaking Michael Johnson's 17-year world record on his way to Olympic gold. Paula Radcliffe, in 2002, was the last British athlete to win one of the IAAF's end-of-year awards while the last Briton to win the men's award was triple jumper Jonathan Edwards in 1995, the year in which he jumped 18.29m - still the world record."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":669,"title":"Manchester United news: Jose Mourinho aims fresh dig at Arsène Wenger following Arsenal draw","class":1,"body":"Jose Mourinho criticised the record of his old rival Arsène Wenger following Saturday’s 1-1 draw between Manchester United and Arsenal. Having seen a late Olivier Giroud header deny his side three points, Mourinho claimed in his post-match press conference that the draw had felt like a defeat and he had finally lost against Arsène. The Portuguese, who nevertheless remains unbeaten in the league against Arsenal, later made a point of noting that his rival had failed to build a team to be champion since 2004. I said yesterday at the press conference, Mourinho told ESPN Brasil. The Arsenal manager hasn’t won a championship in 14 [sic] years. I haven’t won a championship in 18 months. He, in 14 years, failed to build a team to be champion. I’ve been here for four months. And the demand is only for me and not for others. It must be because of the career I’ve made, because I got to the clubs and always won right away, he added. Mourinho’s United remained six points behind fourth-place Arsenal following the draw, having shared the points for the third consecutive league game at Old Trafford. The former Chelsea manager cited a lack of preparation time as the reason behind his side’s sluggish start and preached the importance of ‘stability’. And this is a more difficult reality, because it is an extremely difficult competition, with teams being prepared for a lot longer, with excellent players, with excellent coaches. Manchester really live in a period that needs stability. A stability that the club wants to give me, a stability that the club gives me, a stability that the fans give me, but that the press does not accept very well."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":670,"title":"Arsenal news: Arsene Wenger ready to rest Alexis Sanchez with winter break in effort to avoid burnout","class":1,"body":"Arsenal could face the busy festive period without star striker Alexis Sanchez after it emerged that manager Arsene Wenger is keen to give him a winter break in an effort to prevent the Chile international suffering from burnout. Sanchez has proven to be Arsenal’s most important player this season so far, having scored six times in the Premier League this season along with two goals in the Champions League. With their place in the last-16 for the Champions League already secured, Arsenal still have reason to deploy a full-strength team against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday as they battle the Parisian side for top spot and a supposed easier draw in the knockout stage, with Sanchez expected to lead the line once again. The 27-year-old has been moved to a central role this season and has flourished as a result, but Wenger has already spoken of his concern that Sanchez could suffer from playing too much football in a short space of time. According to the Daily Mail, Wenger will look to address this concern by giving Sanchez some extra time off during the winter, despite Arsenal already struggling to keep pace with Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table. All three sides have more wins that Arsenal this season, with the Gunners drawing four of their 12 matches this season to see them slip three points behind the Blues. The latest setback saw Manchester United not only come within minutes of victory at Old Trafford on Saturday but also dominate Wenger’s side, and the Frenchman was also fortunate not to see Sanchez suffer any further injury after he returned from international duty with a hamstring knock that left him a doubt for the match until the teams were announced. It appears that Wenger will rest Sanchez in the coming weeks in an effort to ensure that he remains fit through the crucial run of fixtures in January, February and March, although that will mean that the Gunners are without their first-choice striker heading into the festive period if Wenger decides to leave him out ahead of the new year."}

I told him Arsenal was not the game for you, said Mourinho. I don't think he needs 10 or 20 minutes from the bench. He needs less pressure and better conditions for him to express his qualities.

However, Ronaldo is believed to have responded to Koke with a jibe of his own, with the Euro 2016 winner reported to have replied: A f*ggot with a lot of money, you b*****d. The allegations have been reported by Spanish radio station Cadena Cope as the fallout from Real’s comprehensive derby victory continues to intensify, with Koke and Ronaldo believed to have clashed in the changing rooms after the match at the Vincente Calderon on Saturday evening. They also collided on the pitch during a typically heated 90-minute exchange that saw the pair go head-to-head late in the match, with Ronaldo’s performance in the match doing the talking for him as his hat-trick ensured Real remain top of La Liga. Reports in the Spanish media claim Ronaldo and Koke were at loggerheads once again in the doorway to the away dressing room, while they add that Ronaldo’s Real teammate Marcelo was also involved in a verbal exchange with Atletico defender Juanfran, in which the Brazil international is alleged to have joked at Juanfran’s penalty miss in last season’s Champions League final between the two Madrid clubs. Juanma Castano, a reporter for Cadena Cope, claims that Juanfran repeated his homophobic slur when prompted by one of Ronaldo’s teammates, to which Ronaldo responded angrily and warned him of repercussions when they next meet. Ronaldo is alleged to have said: If we see one another in Madrid, let's see what I'm going to do. The three-time Ballon d’Or winner, who is the heavy favourite to win this year’s award, also taunted Koke by questioning his side’s bottle after they lost both the 2014 and 2016 Champions League finals to Real."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":673,"title":"Leicester vs Club Brugge match report: Claudio Ranieri's Foxes progress to the last-16 as group winners","class":1,"body":"Their title defence may be misfiring but the fairytale Premier League champions continue to justify their status in the Champions League. After five of their six group matches, they are through to the knock-out rounds as group winners. It was not quite as comfortable as they might have hoped after sweeping to a two-goal lead inside half an hour after a bright and confident start against the team they had beaten 3-0 in Belgium in September. Brugge rallied after time and Jose Izquierdo's goal gave Michel Preud'homme's team a chance to wrestle back the advantage that Shinji Okazaki and Riyad Mahrez had given Claudio Ranieri's side. But Leicester worked hard and with discipline to protect what they had and with Porto held in Copenhagen their 13 point is enough to ensure they top Group G regardless of what happens when they travel to Porto on 7 December. The evening could hardly have started any better for Leicester, for whom the inclusion of Andy King for Daniel Amartey was the only change from the side beaten at Watford in the Premier League last Saturday. They were in front inside five minutes after their first meaningful attack, a classic Leicester goal from a move that began deep in their own half. Marc Albrighton, who had scored an identically timed goal to launch Leicester's campaign in Belgium in September, swept a pass upfield in search of Jamie Vardy, who had left back Christian Fuchs running with him to pick up a sublime flick from his teammate. Fuchs drove forward along the left before releasing a cross that perfectly bypassed three defenders before Shinji Okasaki met it at the near post and hooked the ball past goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle. The stadium was suddenly an explosion of noise, which can have done little for the confidence of the Brugge players, who were still looking for their first point in the Champions League despite performing well domestically. Where Leicester have worries on that score, Brugge arrived here in fourth place in the Belgian First Division after winning six of their last nine matches. Their chances of gaining anything here receded further when Leicester's lead doubled in the 29th minute. The visitors had enjoyed some good possession, enough to suggest they might find a way to draw level, but then a trip by Dion Cools on Albrighton just inside the box on the left gave away a penalty, which Riyad Mahrez converted for his fourth goal in the group matches. It was already shaping up to be Leicester's best win at home in the competition, having beaten their other two group rivals with a single goal. With Kasper Schmeichel sidelined by the broken hand he sustained in Copenhagen two weeks ago, responsibility for carrying forward Leicester's unblemished record of clean sheets rested with Ron-Robert Zieler, making his Champions League debut.  The German was not seriously tested until three minutes before half-time, when Jose Izquierdo found the space for a diagonal shot towards the right-hand corner. Zieler responded effectively enough, diving to his left to punch the ball away. He and his teammates must have felt comfortable with their night's work as half-time arrived but that changed when the seventh minute of the second half brought the end of Leicester's perfect goals against record as Jose Izquierdo suddenly fired Brugge back into the game with a stunning goal. Breaking from the halfway line, the Colombian forward played a neat one-two with his strike partner, the former Middlesbrough and Burnley front man Jelle Vossen, before outpacing Fuchs with a scorching run down the right that he ended with a clean strike into the top right-hand corner to which Zieler had no answer. Leicester now needed a third goal to ease any building apprehension. They thought they had it just inside the hour when Vardy backheeled a low cross from Fuchs past Butelle. It looked like the cheekiest of goals but the flag was up for offside, and correctly. Leicester City (4-4-2): Zieler; Simpson, Morgan, Huth, Fuchs; Mahrez (Schlupp 68), Drinkwater, King, Albrighton (Amartey 78); Vardy, Okazaki (Gray 68).

{"id":674,"title":"Second former footballer speaks publicly about sexual abuse claims at Crewe Alexandra","class":1,"body":"Steve Walters has become the second former professional footballer to speak publicly about sexually abuse claims by Barry Bennell while at Crewe Alexandra. Walters, who became Crewe's youngest-ever player when he made his professional debut at the age of 16 years and 119 days, made the claim to The Guardian. The 44-year-old’s story follows that of Andy Woodward, who was sexually abused by Bennell while playing for Crewe during the 1980s. Bennell was sentenced to nine years in prison in 1998 for 23 charges of sexual offences against six boys aged between nine and 15, one of them being Woodward. The former youth team coach was jailed again in 2015, sentenced to two years in prison for another historic offence involving a 12-year-old boy in Macclesfield. Woodward waived his right to anonymity and spoke publicly about Bennell’s abuse last week in an attempt to encourage other potential victims to come forward. Since Woodward’s interview, at least six people have contacted the police. The Football Association have also set up a helpline for potential victims. Prior to the interview with Walters, who was not part of the 1998 case against Bennell, Crewe chairman John Bowler broke the club’s silence on the matter. When things come out of the blue you want to make some inquiries from within, he told The Guardian. There is no doubt we concur with what the FA have said and we are now looking at it from within and considering what our actions should be going forward. We are a proud club and when allegations are made that we didn’t take it seriously we want to reflect. I will be meeting with the directors to review the situation. I’m the chairman but we have a board of very dedicated people who are at the heart of what Crewe Alexandra are about. The club are yet to respond to Walters’ claims."}

PSG were furious at a flagrant lack of respect as Serge Aurier was barred entry to the UK owing to an outstanding conviction for assault. PSG issued a furious statement claiming that the Home Office had gone back on their initial approval of an entry visa for Aurier, a decision difficult to understand in the context of European law. Aurier is from Cote d'Ivoire, meaning that as a non-EU national he needs a visa to come to the UK. Due to a sudden about-turn by the British authorities, Serge Aurier has not been allowed to travel for the clash away to Arsenal, said the PSG statement. PSG is stunned by this incomprehensible situation that attacks the very integrity of the Uefa Champions League. PSG claimed that they initially applied for Aurier’s visa on 18 October and that three days later they were told that it would be successful. However, last Wednesday, 16 November, PSG were told that Aurier would not in fact receive a visa due to his conviction for assault from two months before. PSG said that they were told on Tuesday lunchtime, after the rest of the team had flown to London, that Aurier would not be allowed in. PSG considers this extremely tardy response as a flagrant lack of respect for the club, they said. PSG insisted that Uefa had total support for their position. The Home Office, while not commenting on the details of PSG’s claim, insisted that UKVI officials had been in touch with PSG throughout the process. We reserve the right to refuse a visa to anyone who is convicted of criminal offences, a Home Office spokesman said. Mr Aurier received a two month custodial sentence in September for assaulting a police officer. The immigration rules clearly state that non-EU nationals who have received a custodial sentence of less than 12 months within the last five years will be refused on criminality grounds. In September Aurier was sentenced to two months in prison and fined €600 for an altercation outside a Paris nightclub. Aurier was said to have elbowed a policeman in the throat when he was asked to be breathalysed after leaving a club. Aurier maintained his innocence, though, and appealed, which is why PSG were so incensed that he was still not allowed into the UK. PSG coach Unai Emery said that the Aurier was disappointed to not have been allowed into the UK. the club did everything in it's power for Serge to be amongst us tonight, Emery said. Every footballer wants to be involved in a fixture like this but ultimately the decision was not down to us. Of course it is disappointing for the player, he wanted to play in the match."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":676,"title":"Manchester City: Pep Guardiola laments Vincent Kompany's latest set-back ahead of Champions League clash","class":1,"body":"Vincent Kompany is one of the many for whom the end of 2016 cannot come soon enough. The Manchester City captain had already spent 37 weeks of the year out with a variety of injuries and now there is a fresh one to battle. His manager, Pep Guardiola, revealed that Kompany picked up a knee ligament injury during Saturday’s 2-1 win at Crystal Palace and will be out for several more weeks. Kompany is being treated by Ramon Cugat, the Barcelona-based doctor whose team treated him for another knee injury after he broke down after 10 minutes of the Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid. This is Kompany’s 35th separate injury since he came to Manchester City in 2008 and, given that Guardiola had serious doubts about his long-term prospects when he arrived at the Etihad Stadium, he is likely to step up the search for a replacement in the January transfer window. Thus far Kompany’s involvement in City’s Premier League campaign has been 116 minutes of football stretched over three matches. For a man who can be counted one of Manchester City’s great players, his career appears to be closing amid pain and frustration. The latest setback would, Guardiola estimated, cost the 30-year-old a minimum of four more weeks and it remains to be seen whether the club will think it worth including Kompany in their Champions League squad when the competition reopens in February. As he prepared to face Borussia Monchengladbach, Guardiola pointed out that Manchester City had not yet qualified for the knockout phase of the competition, although a draw against a side whose Bundesliga form has collapsed should get them there. He is sad about it, of course, said Guardiola of Kompany. I am sad. He is a good chap and it is a long time that he doesn’t play. He is in the best hands and Dr Cugat will make the treatment as soon as possible. I am told it is not a serious knee ligament injury. A serious knee ligament injury would be six months. This is weeks. This is Manchester City’s first outing in the Champions League since the night they took Barcelona apart at the Etihad Stadium. It was said to be the night that the modern Manchester City arrived as a major European force. As he mulled over that game in the team hotel in Dusseldorf, Guardiola was inclined to play the result down. Ilkay Gundogan, who grew up in Gelsenkirchen, around 30 miles away, was not so reserved. The man who seized control of the night said the 3-1 win over Barcelona was the result he and Guardiola’s Manchester City would always be judged by. It should be said that Barcelona have a fairly indifferent record in England. Beating Barcelona in September 1997 – a team that included Guardiola - did not transform the Newcastle of Kenny Dalglish. When he was asked whether Manchester City were one of the favourites for this season’s Champions League, Guardiola gave a little smile and said it might take a decade before they could be put in that kind of bracket. We were so pleased and happy when we beat Barcelona but it was just a game, said Guardiola, a man for whom a game is never ‘just a game’. But, given the history of the club, we cannot be considered favourites. Look at the Spanish teams, they have played more games over so many more years. Hopefully, it will be shorter than 10 years but Manchester City spent 40 years not playing in Europe and you need time to get back to that level – and we are talking about Barcelona, Real, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich. We have been fighting to do that since Abu Dhabi took the club over and we have been investing – like all big clubs do – to reduce the distance between us. But history is history. It speaks for itself and it counts for a lot. I want to qualify from the groups and then concentrate on the Premier League and on teams like Liverpool and Chelsea. The Champions League has meant we have played eight games more than them and that is a lot. It was not the first time he mentioned those two clubs in his press conference. Their freedom from European football is something Guardiola returned to. The Manchester City manager is a man who suggests things rather than talks openly about them and Liverpool and Chelsea appear to be the two clubs he fears most."}

To be top of the group - it is unbelievable, the Italian said after the 2-1 win over Club Brugge ensured they progress to the knock-out stages as winners of Group H. I'm very proud and happy for the fans, for the chairman, for everybody. It is another journey, to be in the knock-out, and whoever we play it will be a fantastic team, another fairytale. But our job (in the Champions League) is done for now and our mind must be on the Premier League.   We are very close to the relegation zone and we must play at the same level as the Champions League because when we want to do something we achieve something. Leicester's final group match against Porto on 7 December becomes a dead rubber with Porto unable to manage better than a goalless draw in Copenhagen and the knock-out phase does not begin until mid-February, giving Ranieri almost three months to concentrate on pushing his team up the table. Currently they lie 14th, just two points above the bottom three, and Ranieri believes his players are showing signs of a loss of confidence. You could see that tonight, he said. We were playing so well.  We had 70 per cent of the possession and we concede a goal on the counter attack - an Italian manager concede a goal on counter attack! From that point we allowed them a couple more chances.  We created some chances but we needed to stay calm. We finished well so it is okay, but we lack confidence because in the Premier League,  when something happens we concede a goal.  And tonight I think from their first shot at goal we concede. Brugge's second-half performance only increased the frustration being suffered by coach Michel Preud'homme, who has seen his Belgian champions lose all five of their group matches. Leicester played a fantastic first half and we played a fantastic second half and maybe with a bit of luck we could have scored a second goal, he said. You have to play 90 minutes to win a game and the first half for us was a disaster.  We showed them too much respect and that has been our problem in the Champions League."}

Jose Mourinho reunited with his former Inter Milan striker during the summer after Ibrahimovic elected to end his four-year stint in Paris when he contract expired at the end of last season. The pair won the Serie A title in their one season together at the San Siro and admitted the lure of working together again was enough to make him leave the Parc des Princes, despite United being not as strong as PSG. The team I signed for this summer is not as strong as the one I left, but when Mourinho called the decision was easy, said Ibrahimovic, speaking to Swedish newspaper Aftobladet. When he calls I have no problem coming, all we had to decide was when I was to be presented as Man United player. The rest, the financial deal, was not the difficult part. With all the new signings this summer people were getting all excited, but it has been four or five years that the club has not won the league or been in the top of the table. That is something we work on. It was about the challenge really, and I will never say no to a challenge. This is what I wanted – coming to one of the world’s biggest clubs, that has had troubles and not won much of late, and try the Premier League. That is the challenge. Ibrahimovic was speaking after winning Sweden’s Player of the Year award for the 10th consecutive year – and the 11th time overall – after missing United draw with Arsenal on the weekend through injury. Ma That result left the Red Devils sixth in the Premier League and nine points off leaders Chelsea, but Ibrahimovic is certain his side can get back into the title race. I hope so, I believe in what we do, he added. I know the capacity of this team, but it’s still a long way to go. With a bit of luck we should be able to do it."}

The friends snuck away from an official tour of the stadium on Friday afternoon and concealed themselves in a toilet cubicle until the following day’s 12.30pm kick-off. At one point during their overnight stay, somebody knocks on the cubicle door and kneels down on the floor to see whether anyone is in there, only to later walk away. The pair are then seen to emerge from the toilets the next morning and go out into the stadium, managing to watch at least part of Saturday’s 1-1 draw from the Stretford End. The two friends are then collared by security staff and detained. A caption on the near 20-minute-long YouTube video reads: We were interrogated and searched 2 more times, we gave all of our details. They completed all of the necessary background checks to ensure we didn’t pose a threat. We were then asked to explain how we managed to do it to ensure it doesn’t happen again! We were already searched when we came into the stadium, and as we didn’t pose a threat they released us! The two friends attempted a similar stunt at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium before the north London derby earlier this month, only to be caught by security. So after attempting to stay overnight in Arsenal football stadium and failing many of you asked us to attempt to sleep over in Old Trafford, reads the latest video’s description on YouTube. Against all odds with one of the best security in the world we decided to give it a go and see if we could last till morning to see Manchester united [sic] vs Arsenal! The security breach will cause significant embarrassment for United, coming just six months after Old Trafford was evacuated due to a bomb scare. The ‘bomb’ transpired to be a training device left behind by a security firm during a training procedure earlier that week, prior to the final game of the season against Bournemouth. Last week, Bournemouth’s supporters’ trust, The Cherries Trust, revealed that none of Greater Manchester Police, Trafford Council, Sports Ground Safety Authority or Manchester United Football Club had recorded a formal meeting to investigate how the safety breach was allowed to happen. Cherries Trust chairman, Tony Maycock, said: This is first and foremost about ensuring the safety of fans at a football ground. Manchester United failed to ensure that their venue was safe for the thousands of fans who travelled to Old Trafford in May.  Six months later, they appear to have shown no effort to make sure this won’t happen again."}

The former Manchester United youth team player picked out several members of Jose Mourinho's first-team squad for criticism while analysing his old club’s 1-1 draw with Arsenal. Dunphy told RTÉ 2fm: It was a spirited performance, but in the end they gave up a soft goal. David de Gea had nothing to do all afternoon, but for the goal the full-back walked past Marcus Rashford. Paul Pogba should have been giving him cover, he didn’t bother, he just stood there because he doesn’t really understand the game. When discussing United’s squad, Dunphy identified Ibrahimovic, Rooney, Memphis Depay and Marcos Rojo as players who are no longer good enough to make Mourinho’s starting line-up. I’d say Ibrahimovic has no more football in him, Dunphy said. Against the weaker teams they had to play at the beginning, I think he got six goals in seven games and they were important goals as well. But he’s way past his sell by date. He’s 35 now. He can’t really put in the work. The passing, scoring goals, his general play has been very, very poor. Rooney looks like he’s finally burnt out. He hasn’t been a first choice for Mourinho for a few weeks. And he’s never played in his correct position. When Mourinho arrived, one of the first this he said was that Rooney is a goalscorer, a number 10, and that’s where he’ll play. He hasn’t played there at all. I think you can forget Rooney in terms of saving the day for Manchester United. He was a marvellous player, but he’s not going to be that anymore. Where’s Memphis? He was another player they played a lot of money for, he added. There are picture of Memphis floating around Manchester in his Rolls Royce, which is one of a number of big cars he has. But he’s not playing any football. It’s a good job if you can get it. Dunphy, who has enjoyed a successful media career following his retirement from professional football, is known for his forthright punditry. The Irish broadcaster is also a biographer of Sir Matt Busby. Dunphy played for United's youth teams between 1962 and 1965, during the Scot's reign."}

Talks were ongoing between the Dons and Gerrard to replace Karl Robinson after the ex-England captain announced he would leave MLS side LA Galaxy in December when his contract expires. The League One side, who were also speaking to other candidates, will continue their search, while Gerrard’s future remains unclear. The 36-year-old has been linked with a playing role at Italian giants Inter Milan, as well as taking up a coaching role at either Liverpool or Celtic, where former manager Brendan Rodgers is in charge. He could also be in line for a role in Gareth Southgate’s new coaching set up with England, should he receive the job on a permanent basis, a role he could combine with any potential job at Liverpool. Reds manager Jurgen Klopp has always insisted Gerrard would be welcome back at Anfield whenever he wanted to return and it is understood informal talks are ready to get underway between the two parties. However, more formal talks are likely to have to wait until the New Year, with Liverpool involved in a tight title race over the busy Christmas schedule.

The former Liverpool legend believes the Spaniard can now lay claim to being one of the best No 10s in the league after he took his tally to four goals in 15 appearances under Jose Mourinho this season. The goal was also his 13th against one of the ‘big six’ clubs since he arrived in England with Chelsea from Valencia in 2011, more than any of his other playmaker rivals. Mata’s time at Old Trafford was expected to be over in the summer upon Mourinho’s arrival after the Spaniard sold him to United in 2014, only six months after returning to Stamford Bridge. However, his performances have arguably been the most stand-out from a United player this season and Carragher believes they have gone under the radar. Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: I think we're looking at one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. When we think of great No 10s, players who like to get in between the lines, players of his ilk like Ozil, De Bruyne, Coutinho, Silva and Hazard. We should be rating this man a lot higher. People always talk about assists with No 10s, but I don't care what position you play a goal is more important than an assist for me. He's getting more goals than any players in those positions, only Silva has more assists. I think the reason he doesn't get that credit the others get, he was Player of the Year in his first two years at Chelsea, then Mourinho comes in – the best manager in the world – and decides ‘not for me’."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":684,"title":"Manchester United news: Lay off Paul Pogba, the difference between great and mediocre has been Zlatan Ibrahimovic","class":1,"body":"Ahead of this season's Premier League campaign, Manchester United were looked upon in fear once again. A world record signing along with a world class manager, Jose meant business, or so we thought. Results are everything in football, after all, it's a results based business. You can play beautiful football, but if a rough and tumble style of football can overcome your footballing masterpiece, then perhaps it's not the masterpiece you once thought it was and that's been the story of most of United's season as of yet. Whether it's Mark Clattenburg, Tom Heaton or Olivier Giroud, there's always one more red-light on Jose Mourinho's road to success as United manager. There have been positives, though - Spanish duo Juan Mata and Ander Herrera's exquisite form have resulted in the pair becoming undroppable and Ivorian Eric Bailly's rise to the fore meant the centre-back drew comparisons with United greats such as Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand. However, United's failure to pick-up points this season has overshadowed Frenchman Paul Pogba's performances completely. The 23-year-old has created 21 chances in the Premier League for the Red Devils this season, scoring two of his own, and Pogba's performances in a United shirt this season have been exactly what the club were crying out for while under the reign of both David Moyes and Louis van Gaal. In the central midfield role, many have tried and many have failed. Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Wayne Rooney and Marouane Fellaini have all resorted to another position or even worse, to the bench. The perfect mix in midfield has been hard to find at Old Trafford in recent times but through Michael Carrick, Pogba, and Herrera, they looked to have found it. United's problem this season has been in the goals department. The incapability to kill games off has come back to bite them against both Stoke City and Arsenal this season, whereas against Burnley, despite Heaton's heroics, they couldn't find a way past the goalkeeper and again, dropped two valuable points at home. Pogba has been the centre of attention ever since his return to United this season, which is to be expected when you carry the world's most expensive player tag on your shoulders, but the public's perception of his performances in red is far from the correct one. The former Juventus midfielder has an 86% pass completion rate and out of 669 passes, 75% were forward passes. In Van Gaal's era at the club, the Dutchman's most heavy criticism was the 'boring' style of football United played, something that was not in the clubs DNA. Sideways passes were followed by backward passes, and the need for a creative midfielder was never higher. Pogba has added that in abundance and if ego-maniac Zlatan Ibrahimovic had been on form, both against Stoke and Burnley, Pogba could have been just short of an assist count in double figures. The eagerness of Pogba when carrying United forward has been sorely missed in recent seasons, and the strength Pogba possesses has resulted in him driving United forward time and time again, relieving pressure off of the back four and getting United out of danger - something the stats don't show you."}

Palace are without a win in five as the side continue to languish in the bottom end of the Premier League. The Eagles currently sit in 16th on 11 points, one point above the relegation zone. According to the Sun, the club’s board are running thin on patience and are prepared to show the 55-year-old the door should Saturday’s match end in defeat. It’s understood that Sam Allardyce is under consideration as a potential replacement but no approach has been made to the former England manager. Current Wales boss Chris Coleman is also allegedly being weighed up as an option. As a former defender at the club, the Welshman could be tempted by a return to the Premier League. But contrasting reports have suggested that the club are fully behind the Englishman, despite the fact the side have managed just five wins throughout 2016. Pardew held talks with the club’s major shareholders during the international break and flew to New York to meet American co-owners David Blitzer and Josh Harris where they addressed the side’s dismal run. He said the two Americans, who each bought an 18 per cent stake in Palace last year, are not looking for a short-term fix and are very supportive. Nonetheless, Pardew has admitted that Saturday’s game against Swansea is pivotal in our season. You cannot hide from that.

With Messi currently in contract limbo at Barcelona after reportedly rejecting their latest offer, City are growing in confidence at signing the 29-year-old, especially with their trio of Pep Guardiola, Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano all working with the Argentine at the Nou Camp in the past. Messi missed Saturday’s 0-0 draw with Malaga through illness, and The Mirror reports this morning that City are putting together a £200m move to tempt him to England where he will become the world’s highest-paid player, overtaking Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo who signed a new contract last week.  The report claims that City are willing to offer a fee of over £100m to Barcelona to part with the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, and when his wages and additional bonuses are taking into account, City will have to fork out over £200m to complete the deal. Messi has a £215m buy-out clause in his contract that expires in 2018, but with the club and player currently at a stalemate in negotiations, the Catalan side fear he could reach the summer with just 12 months remaining on his deal. That would lead to the club facing a huge dilemma in that they would have to sell Messi or risk losing a potential £100m-plus player for nothing, or bow to his demands and give him the contract that he desires. City are one of few clubs who are able to cater to Messi’s demands and, along with Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, would be able to tempt Barcelona into selling the Argentina international if he reaches next summer with no new deal in sight. United have already shown their intent in flexing their financial fire-power to sign world-record signing Paul Pogba this year for £89m, although reports suggest that the club would not rivals City to sign Messi if it were to cost as much as £200m."}

However, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is growing increasingly frustrated with Kane’s representatives, according to The Sun, as he refuses to break his strict wage structure. Tottenham have a policy not to pay any player a six-figure weekly salary which Levy is adamant he will stick to, especially given the new stadium that is currently being built adjacent to White Hart Lane. United have been keeping tabs on Kane’s development over the last two seasons but now they are monitoring the situation even closer, with Jose Mourinho wanting to line up a long-term replacement for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who only signed a one-year deal with the club, with the option of a second in the summer. Spurs are in no rush to sell last season’s Golden Boot winner, with Kane’s current contract not set to expire until 2020.

{"id":692,"title":"Boxing on TV: Sergey Kovalev vs Andre Ward, Claressa Shields vs Franchon Crews","class":1,"body":"One of the most eagerly anticipated fights of the year takes place in Las Vegas tonight, as two of the best fighters on the planet finally face each other live on Sky Sports. Both Andre Ward and Sergey Kovalev have won 30 professional fights against zero defeats, and each man has a claim to be the greatest light heavyweight on Earth. Kovalev is the more comfortable fighter at the weight, having been a world champion at light heavyweight since August 2013 when he travelled to Wales and dismantled Nathan Cleverly. The Russian has looked virtually unbeatable ever since, with dominant stoppage victories over the likes of Jean Pascal and Nadjib Mohammedi supplemented with points wins over Bernard Hopkins and most recently Isaac Chilemba last July. Much has been made of Kovalev’s fearsome power which has seen him earn 26 wins by stoppage, but the 33-year-old is a crafty boxer who can box to a disciplined game-plan if needed. His cerebral nature is another factor Ward will have to deal with as Kovalev seems impervious to pressure. Whether it was the decision to continue his destructive boxing style despite Roman Simakov dying three days after their 2011 fight, or traveling abroad to face Nathan Cleverly in Wales and Jean Pascal in Canada, Kovalev continually remains as stoic as as a statue. Despite being a year older than Ward, Kovalev has boxed exactly half the rounds of his decorated opponent, and has only gone past eight rounds twice. Conversely, Ward has completed the 12 round distance nine times in his career, a statistic which has led to complaints about a so-called ‘boring’ style offered by the American. That myth has led to the enigmatic becoming a fighter who should be so much more popular than he actually is. The 32-year-old Athens 2004 Olympic gold medallist is unbeaten since 1996, and has rarely looked bothered let alone threatened during his professional career. One-sided victories at super middleweight over impressive names including Carl Froch, Mikkel Kessler and Arthur Abraham established Ward as the man in that division, but an 18 month spell on the sidelines between 2013 and 2015 threatened to leave him as the forgotten man in boxing. He is what you what call a Sunday morning fighter, a boxer you want to marvel at with a cup of tea and the dog curled up at your feet, rather than a 5am Saturday night brawler. A comeback victory last year over the ludicrously chosen Paul Smith ignited Ward’s comeback, and two subsequent light heavyweight successes over Sullivan Barrera and Alexander Brand has established his talent at the higher weight class. If you consider pure boxing fundamentals, Ward has it all. An amazing jab to both head and body help to create many of his innovative attacks, while his sublime footwork and head movement enable him to stay unflustered and untroubled against attacking boxers. That movement will be key against the swarming Kovalev, who while not possessing the fastest hands in boxing, can change the course of a fight with one punch. This is more than just a boxer vs puncher battle because both men can utilise weaponry that goes beyond their obvious skills. When Ward sits down on his punches he has disarming power which can stun opponents, while Kovalev’s sense of timing and ring awareness is vastly underrated too. The bookmakers can barely split them, with Ward a narrow ⅘ favourite with Kovalev available outright at evens. Those anticipating Ward to fluster and eventually break down the Russian could be tempted by him to stop Kovalev between rounds 9 and 12 at 16/1, while those who believe the Russian can exploit Ward’s lack of ring-time against credible opponents can get him to win by stoppage at 9/4. The highlight of an underwhelming undercard in Las Vegas is the professional debut of two-time Olympic gold medallist Claressa Shields. Elsewhere, Isaac Chilemba meets the highly rated 11-0 Oleksandr Gvozdyk and the undefeated Maurice Hooker fights Darleys Perez at light welterweight. There is more boxing on television tonight at 8pm on BoxNation where Marco Huck defends his IBF cruiserweight title against Dmytro Kucher. Huck is one of the most entertaining fighters in boxing, and became a cruiserweight champion again in February after stopping Ola Afolabi in the tenth round. His opponent tonight is known to British fans for finishing Enzo Maccarinelli inside the first three minutes of their bout in June, and the Ukrainian has won by stoppage 18 times in his career. Expect Huck to assert his top-level experience with a stoppage victory at 13/8 odds."}

Groves said he was deeply concerned for the welfare of his opponent and did not discuss his performance at the post-fight press conference. Out of respect to Eduard Gutknecht and his family's privacy, I don't want to say too much but we are all deeply concerned to hear that he was taken to hospital after the fight last night, he said. I sincerely hope it is nothing too serious and I would like to send out all my support and best wishes to him and his family at this difficult time. At the same venue in March, English middleweight Nick Blackwell collapsed at the end of his stoppage defeat by Chris Eubank Jnr. He suffered bleeding on his skull and was treated at St Mary's hospital in Paddington where he eventually recovered, despite having to retire. More recently in September, Scottish welterweight Mike Towell died just 25 hours after losing to Dale Evans in Glasgow. He had suffered severe bleeding and swelling to his brain."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":694,"title":"Boxing on TV: George Groves vs Eduard Gutknecht, Paddy Gallagher vs Tamuka Mucha, Andrew Selby vs Jake Bornea","class":1,"body":"George Groves return to the ring on Channel 5 as he continues his quest to challenge for a world title for the fourth time. Consecutive stoppage defeats to Carl Froch and a disputed points loss to Badou Jack seemed to have set Groves back, but three victories in a row including a dominant display against Martin Murray has breathed new life into his career. In many ways, Groves is the Arsenal of boxing. His fans are loyal and tenacious, but too often prone to hyperbole. They think he’s the best in the world, a Thierry Henry figure of unstoppable awesomeness, but then he’s a flash in the pan Jose Antonio Reyes. He promised so much in his younger years, but has ultimately has failed to pull the trigger when it really mattered. And it all could have been so different. What if Jens Lehmann had not been sent off in the 2005 Champions League final? And what if Groves knocked Carl Froch down ten seconds earlier in their first bout? His opponent is Eduard Gutknecht, a 34-year-old German most known for two light heavyweight world title losses to Juergen Braehmer. Gutknecht is a solid boxer who may have a size advantage at super middleweight, but he’s the type of opponent that is tailor-made for Groves. The Englishman works best when fighting a cagey counter-punching style, and he also has the ability - sometimes at his disadvantage - to become involved in a tear up. Groves carries power as well, with 18 stoppages from 24 victories, but was taken the distance by Murray and Christopher Rebrasse in September 2014. This isn’t just a typical fight for Groves though. He’s still one of the most recognisable names in British boxing and thus is expected to perform well. Only a stoppage victory will do in terms of convincing people that he can still mix it at world level. The odds are fairly generous, with Groves 6/4 to win by knockout. If you fancy Gutknecht to finish the sometimes vulnerable Groves, odds can be found at 20/1. Groves’ stablemate Conrad Cummings features on the undercard in an intriguing test against Ronny Mittag, while amateur star Andrew Selby continues his professional career by facing Jake Bornea. Perhaps the most intriguing support bout on the bill comes at welterweight between Paddy Gallagher and Tamuka Mucha. Gallagher became one of the few fighters in history to lose twice on the same night when he suffered two Prizefighter defeats in 2014, but he will be looking to perform well against the undefeated Mucha."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":695,"title":"Manny Pacquiao fuels speculation of Floyd Mayweather rematch with cryptic social media post","class":1,"body":"Manny Pacquiao has fuelled speculation of a rematch with Floyd Mayweather after uploading a cryptic post to social media. The Philippine was comfortably beaten by the American in 2015, with both boxers announcing their retirement in the wake of the fight. But Pacquiao’s retirement was short-lived and earlier this month the 37-year-old returned to the ring to comprehensively outpoint Jessie Vargas. After promoter Bob Arum announced that a rematch with Mayweather was 75 per cent likely to happen, Pacquiao has now added to the mounting rumours with his latest Instagram post. The boxer shared a photo of himself wearing a new jacket, with images of the old foes fighting sewn into the lining. Accompanying the post was the cryptic caption Like my jacket? Mayweather has been retired since May 2015 and enjoys a remarkable 49-0 winning record, but the 39-year-old was present at ringside when Pacquaio claimed the WBO belt against Vargas on November 5. Speaking after the fight, Arum told ESPN: Like everyone else, I'm guessing there will be a rematch. He did come to the fight. I give it 75 per cent. Do I know it's gonna happen? No. Do I know if Floyd wants the fight? No. I know nothing more than the public knows at this point and what I observed. He added: It was so tense last time, but it won't be that way now because everyone can get along. Floyd came to the fight and he was very friendly with [Top Rank president] Todd [duBoef] and some of our staff.

{"id":696,"title":"No fix, no dive, no brown envelope, just one judge's poor call in Jamie McDonnell title defence","class":1,"body":"Nobody was given a brown envelope stuffed with cash as an extra payment for services rendered in Monaco on Saturday night. There was no fix, nobody took a dive and nobody was bribed in any way to deliver a crooked verdict in any of the fights. However, there was a truly dreadful score by one of the three judges in one of the two world title fights, but Robert Hoyle, the judge in question, would have slept like a baby in first class all the way back to Las Vegas, blissfully unconcerned about the final card he surrendered. He did nothing illegal, he was just hopelessly wrong on the night. A study of Hoyle's last 250 fights uncovers not one consistent error, no favours to certain promoters, no obvious like or dislike of particular fighters and nothing to suggest the full horror of his score in the Jamie McDonnell and Liborio Solis WBA bantamweight fight.  McDonnell, who was defending his title for the fifth time, let the tiny Solis bully him too often and at the final bell it was tight, very tight. McDonnell looked like he knew he had lost, but all three judges voted in his favour. One judge gave it by four rounds, which seemed too wide, a second by two rounds and then Hoyle delivered his remarkable score giving the fight to McDonnell by six rounds. Eddie Hearn, the promoter of the show and McDonnell's promoter, said that he thought McDonnell had just nicked it. McDonnell never nicked it, but Solis left the ring convinced he had been robbed.  It is just the latest blip by a member of the elite fraternity of men and women that circle the globe, dining out in fancy restaurants, staying in the best hotels, flying in the best beds in the sky and then sit down at ringside to judge boxers that are promoted by the men that lavishly cater to their needs. There was no need to send Hoyle back to Las Vegas with a brown envelope, just a reassurance that he would be requested again the next time a wonderful European jolly takes place. It is a perfectly legal system, tested over decades and everybody in the business knows that promoters will try and negotiate to get certain judges and referees and refuse other officials once a fight is agreed. There is always a compromise, but it is rare that a fight takes place and a promoter openly declares his displeasure at the selection of one or more of the men and women judging at ringside. It is not illegal to have the same referee, the same kind judges in place; the onus is on the visiting boxer's team to scream and shout and demand a change. Solis, who lost a world title fight in Japan earlier this year, is from Venezuela and has no clout. Hopefully, he will get a rematch, get paid again, but next time McDonnell will box like he is six inches taller and make easy work of a hard fight. There was an attempt at change once by a man called Big Jon Robinson, who worked as an official for the IBF in the Eighties and in the Nineties founded his own sanctioning body. The WBU was based above a flower shop in Hackney and Robinson had strict rules for all of his officials; they were not allowed any social contact with the promoter, they dined together, travelled together, avoided booze and remained aloof at all times. The WBU had some golden years before Robinson, who was once Britain's fattest man, died. It would be wonderfully convenient if a high-ranking judge or referee simply stepped forward with evidence that he had been paid to fix a fight. In the last fifty years a few officials have been successfully prosecuted for taking bribes from promoters and managers who paid in the hope that their boxers would secure a high ranking or a title fight. The FBI filmed and taped the men that administered the IBF back in the early Nineties with one hapless fixer taking cash out of a sock and paying it to the man that ran the New Jersey-based sanctioning body.  The boxing business can be a desperate business with enough rogue operators, chancers, conmen, addicts, boozers and fiends all involved that it is a miracle nobody has crossed the righteous line with a concrete tale of corruption. There are men that would sell their child's puppy for a place at the table, but are unable to offer any evidence of a fixed fight.  On Saturday night Hoyle got it horribly wrong and he should now be placed on leave for a year and then made to attend some type of refresher course for judges. If such a thing existed it would be a good way to bring the rival sanctioning bodies together and Bob Arum, who has been promoting since the Sixties, believes it is long, long overdue. Do these guys really know what they are looking for? said Arum after a wayward score in a world title fight in Las Vegas at the start of the month. In 1980 Arum was left furious by another judge when Vito Antuofermo lost to Alan Minter for the middleweight world title in Las Vegas. It was a split decision in Minter's favour, with one judge going for him by three rounds after 15 rounds and one voting for Antuofermo by two rounds. It was a tight fight, but the third judge went for Minter by 13 rounds, scored one even and gave just one to poor Vito; the judge was Roland Dakin, who was British. Dakin scored the fight like a Minter fan and that must not be allowed to happen again, said Arum. Dakin, by the way, was forced to explain that Vito was not hitting with the correct part of the glove. On Saturday one man got it badly wrong, one man kept his title and another man suffered - it is not right, but it was not a fix. Sadly, not one thing will change and that is unfortunate for the anonymous fighters like Solis who get stitched up all over the world every weekend."}

The four-time world super-middleweight champion has forged a successful media career since, working as an analyst on Sky Sports, but rumours of a return to the ring have persisted. Eddie Hearn, who worked as Froch’s promoter, has now claimed that his former fighter is prepared to face Kazakhstan’s Golovkin, who is rated by many as the world’s best pound-for-pound fighter. Hearn told The Times: Carl texted me tonight and said, ‘What weight would Golovkin fight me at?’ and I said, ‘172lb [4lb above the super-middleweight limit]’ and [Tom] Loeffler [Golovkin’s promoter] said ‘170’, Carl has got wound up, added Hearn, who met with Loeffler in Monaco this weekend.

Cuba’s 25-0 Luis Ortiz is one of the most powerful punchers in the world, and the 37-year-old makes his European debut against veteran Malik Scott in Monte Carlo. At 37, time is not on Ortiz’s side, but the Cuban has looked impressive in recent knockout victories over Tony Thompson and Bryant Jennings, and will be looking to defeat his third American opponent in a row. Despite his fearsome record, there are both technical and moral issues over Ortiz, with his stamina a question mark along with a 2014 drug test failure for steroids. Matchroom have snapped him up despite the performance enhancing drugs, and they could not have chosen a better opening opponent than Scott. The American has an impressive 38-2-1 record, but has only fought twice in the past two years, with both of his defeats coming in slightly suspicious circumstances. A July 2013 loss to Dereck Chisora occurred after he failed to rise for the ten count, while he was knocked out in one round by Deontay Wilder a year later. Scott is a crafty and cunning boxer who has been a professional since 2000, but he folds under pressure, and that will undoubtedly come in abundance from his Cuban opponent. Ortiz is a huge 1/16 favourite with the bookies, leaving Scott a 10/1 underdog. Take a look at the 11/4 odds for Ortiz to finish the fight between rounds five and eight as he is most dangerous in the middle rounds. From Cuba to Doncaster in Monaco, as Jamie McDonnell defends his WBA bantamweight title for the fifth time against 34-year-old Liborio Solis. McDonnell has quietly become one of Britain’s most decorated fighters, with the 30-year-old not tasting defeat since March 2008. Two 2015 victories over Tomoki Kameda gained McDonnell a worldwide reputation, and he is a heavy favourite against his Venezuelan opponent. Solis has only lost once in five years, and looked somewhat impressive in that defeat earlier this year to Japanese sensation Shinsuke Yamanaka. Speed and accuracy will be key in this fight however, which are two attributes McDonnell possesses in great amounts. For those betters looking for value, have a look at McDonnell by stoppage. The Doncaster man has won three of his last five fights by TKO, and seems to be developing power as his career continues. Liverpool’s Stephen Smith has his second world title opportunity of 2016 in Monaco, but the 31-year-old faces a difficult challenge against in-form American Jason Sosa. Smith was outclassed in his April effort against IBF super featherweight champion Jose Pedraza, and is hoping for better luck in his quest for the WBA title. Sosa has developed into a dangerous boxer however, and is a far cry from the fighter who won just two of his first five fights. His record knockout victory over Javier Fortuna earned him his world title, and that came after his scintillating draw with the undefeated Nicholas Walters. Although Sosa’s recent pedigree is impressive, he is great value for betting at 8/11 to win outright, with Smith available at evens to become the second sibling from his family to become world champion. Elsewhere on the card in Monaco, Martin Murray returns to face undefeated German Nuhu Lawal, while French amateur star Adriani Vastine continues his professional career."}

Instead, the pair are likely to fight early next year with the IBF title, should Joshua prevail against Molina, and the WBA super title both scheduled to be on the line. Ortiz was signed by Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom Boxing, who also represent Joshua, and called out the 27-year-old, with Joshua is keen to touch gloves with Cuban-born boxer. I see how that is going to unfold. That's another fight, for me, that is no problem, Joshua told Sky Sports. Hopefully I defeat Klitschko and then I can fight Luis Ortiz. I will be watching him for sure because he is a competitor in the division that I could face sooner or later, so I have to put him as a priority. If we fight Ortiz, it would be a good scrap because I like fighting southpaws. I've got a powerful right hand that I could whip into the body or straight to the head. It will be a good challenge and a good name to have on the record at some stage, but first let's focus on The Drummer Boy, Eric Molina. Ortiz, nicknamed ‘King Kong’, faces Malik Scott in Monte Carlo this weekend but wasted no time in challenging the biggest names in the heavyweight division. I'm willing to fight anyone, any champion, any place, any time. I'm ready for anyone: Joshua, Wilder, Klitschko. I know I can beat all of them.

A lot of his shots came on pick-and-pops where both Portland defenders went with the ball, or where Love’s man just flat-out lost him at the arc and couldn’t recover. That said, Love hit some tough fade-aways and made plays in the post. Once he started to see the ball go in nothing was going to stop him.

But patients with early dementia due to Alzheimer's didn't seem to get much benefit from the drug, the company that makes it said. Patients treated with solanezumab did not experience a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline compared to patients treated with placebo, drug maker Eli Lilly and Co said in a statement.

Related: Dementia Rates Might be Declining Just this week, researchers reported that dementia rates appeared to be falling in the U.S. But the number of people reaching age 65 and at higher risk of dementia is growing, so even if rates fall, the number of people with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia can still grow. There are just a handful of Alzheimer's drugs on the market now, all approved more than a decade ago. They include Aricept, Namenda and Exelon, and they can treat symptoms for a while but do not affect the disease itself. Companies have been betting on a new generation of magic bullet drugs -- solanezumab, aducanumab and gantenerumab. They are engineered proteins that specifically attack amyloid. While today's results are a setback for the amyloid hypothesis, there are several other anti-amyloid drugs still in clinical trials that work in different ways. The results of the solanezumab EXPEDITION3 trial were not what we had hoped for and we are disappointed for the millions of people waiting for a potential disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease, said John Lechleiter, president and chief executive officer of Lilly. We will evaluate the impact of these results on the development plans for solanezumab and our other Alzheimer's pipeline assets.

{"id":704,"title":" Abortions Hit New Low in U.S. ","class":1,"body":" The number and rate of abortions tallied by federal authorities have fallen to their lowest level in decades, according to new data released Wednesday. The latest annual report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, incorporating data from 47 states, said the abortion rate for 2013 was 12.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years. That is down 5 percent from 2012, and is half the rate of 25 recorded in 1980. The last time the CDC recorded a lower abortion rate was in 1971, two years before the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision that established a nationwide right for women to have abortions. Abortion was legal in some states at that time. The CDC tallied 664,435 abortions in 2013 from the 47 states, down 5 percent from 2012 and down 20 percent from 2004. The CDC does not receive abortion data from California, Maryland and New Hampshire — and thus its total is less than the widely accepted current estimate of more than 900,000 abortions per year in all 50 states. Related: Ohio Abortion Law Made Women Less Safe Back in 1990, when California was supplying data, the CDC recorded a peak of more than 1.4 million abortions. The CDC's latest findings meshed with an Associated Press state-by-state survey conducted last year — with extensive data from 2014 — showing that abortions had been declining in virtually every state since 2010. There were big declines in conservative states passing laws to restrict abortions and also in more liberal states that protected abortion rights. Related: Europe's Abortion Fight The CDC report suggests there are several factors behind the abortion decline, including a sharp drop in adolescent pregnancies, expanded coverage of contraception costs by health care plans, and increased use of effective, long-lasting contraceptive methods such as intrauterine devices and hormonal implants. Among the CDC's detailed findings: Women in their 20s accounted for more than 58 percent of abortions and had the highest abortion rates. Young women and girls aged 19 and under accounted for 11.7 percent of abortions. Two-thirds of abortions were performed within the first eight weeks of gestation, and nearly 92 percent by 13 weeks. Only 1.3 percent were performed after 20 weeks — a point at which many anti-abortion activists want a federal abortion ban to be imposed. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to support such a ban if legislation reaches his desk.State abortion rates varied widely, from 3.6 per 1,000 women age 15-44 in Mississippi to 24.3 in New York. Mississippi is among a handful of states with only one functioning abortion clinic. Medical abortions — generally using the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol — accounted for about 22 percent of abortions; surgical procedures accounted for nearly all the others. About 15 percent of women who obtained an abortion were married. About 60 percent had previously given birth to at least one child."}

Dogs were first trained to imitate human actions on command, Fugazza's team wrote in their report, published in Current Biology. Then they were trained to simply lie down after any command. The idea was to trick the dogs into forgetting that they had been trained to imitate the trainer. These findings show that dogs recall past events as complex as human actions. We then tested whether dogs recalled the demonstrated actions by unexpectedly giving them the command to imitate, instead of lying down. So for instance, a trainer would tap an open umbrella, then take the dog behind a screen for a while, return the dog to the room, where it would lie down. Then the trainer would give the unexpected command Do it. Many, but not all of the dogs would repeat the action -- walking up to the umbrella and tapping it with a paw. There's a video of one experiment here. Even though the dogs could not have been expecting that they would be asked to imitate a trainer's actions, they could. The actions were odd, such as hitting an umbrella or walking around a bucket, so the dogs had to have remembered what the people did, the researchers said. These findings show that dogs recall past events as complex as human actions even if they do not expect the memory test, providing evidence for episodic-like memory, the team concluded. So be careful what you do in front of your dog."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":707,"title":" Zika Virus Damages Babies' Brains After Birth, Doctors Report ","class":1,"body":" Babies born looking normal and healthy after a Zika infection are developing smaller-than-normal heads months later, doctors reported Tuesday - a bad sign that shows the virus continues to damage a baby for weeks or months. That means that if a pregnant women gets infected with Zika, her baby could be at risk not only in the womb, but long after birth. Assessment of a Series of 13 Infants with Congenital Zika Virus Infection without Microcephaly at Birth CDC And it's one more unpleasant surprise from the Zika virus, once thought unremarkable and now showing it can wreak havoc in ways never seen before. Dr. Vanessa Van der Linden, the pediatric neurologist in Recife, Brazil, who sounded the first public alert about Zika, examined 13 babies that appeared to have been infected with Zika in the womb but who were born looking unaffected. This report documents that microcephaly at birth is not an essential hallmark of congenital Zika syndrome. It turns out they were not unscathed. Among all infants, head growth was documented to have decelerated as early as 5 months of age, and 11 infants had microcephaly, Van der Linden and colleagues report in a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Assessment of a Series of 13 Infants with Congenital Zika Virus Infection without Microcephaly at Birth Zika virus has been proven beyond all doubt to cause microcephaly, the medical name for a smaller-than-normal head. It's caused when the brain of a developing fetus is damaged and shrinks, causing the skull to either collapse or to grow slowly, also. It also causes other damage to the brains and bodies of babies. Van der Linden's team has been watching many babies born after the mothers tested positive. They focused on 13 in particular. All infants had positive tests for Zika virus, they wrote. The children had other problems, also. Ten had trouble feeding, the researchers reported. Van der Linden has reported this before, and says Zika-affected babies often suffer from painful reflux. Seven had epilepsy - another common diagnosis - and almost all of them had a stiffening of the limbs called hypertonia. They make good eye contact, which can lead parents to believe they aren't as badly affected as they really are, Van der Linden says. This report documents that microcephaly at birth is not an essential hallmark of congenital Zika syndrome, the team wrote. Assessment of a Series of 13 Infants with Congenital Zika Virus Infection without Microcephaly at Birth. CDC Infants with normal head circumference at birth have brain and other abnormalities associated with congenital Zika syndrome and might develop microcephaly after birth. These findings demonstrate the importance of early neuroimaging for infants exposed to Zika virus prenatally and the need for comprehensive medical and developmental follow-up. It's not clear what's happening. Zika could be causing a long-term infection in the brain or it could damage immature cells in the womb, that then do not go on to develop into normal tissue as they should as the baby grows after being born. These findings demonstrate the importance of early neuroimaging for infants exposed to Zika virus prenatally and the need for comprehensive medical and developmental follow-up.Zika has spread across Latin America, the Caribbean and is causing smaller outbreaks in south Florida. Some countries have reporting matching epidemics of microcephaly and other birth defects. In the United States, the CDC reports more than 4,200 cases of Zika, nearly all carried by travelers from other areas. Florida reports more than 200 locally-acquired cases, spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquitos that thrive in Florida. Florida officials cleared on area of Miami Beach where Zika had been spreading. The newly cleared area, which is about three miles, is between 28th to 63rd streets. The last known person contracted Zika in this area on September 27th, the state health department said in a statement. The remaining area of active Zika transmission in Miami Beach is about 1.5 square miles between 8th and 28th streets. In Florida, 160 pregnant women have been infected with Zika. More than 1,000 pregnant women in the U.S. have been infected. Health experts say their babies will need to be monitored for years. There's no cure for Zika and the brain damage it causes is permanent. The CDC says pregnant women or those who could become pregnant should avoid Zika zones. All of Miami-Dade remains a yellow area and pregnant women are eligible for Zika virus testing. All pregnant women in the United States should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure during each prenatal care visit, the CDC advises."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":708,"title":" Cultural Factors Complicate Zika Prevention in American Samoa ","class":1,"body":"While the Zika virus is well documented in South and Central America, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the mosquito-borne disease known to cause severe birth defects is also spreading in the U.S. territory of American Samoa, a group of islands in the South Pacific with a population of approximately 55,000. And despite extensive prevention and education efforts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, American Samoa may see even worse outcomes than expected due to economic and cultural factors, according to health officials and anthropologists. There are currently 54 officially reported Zika cases in American Samoa, with at least 21 confirmed in pregnant women, and no cases of microcephaly yet, according to Scott Anesi, the territorial epidemiologist with the American Samoa Department of Health. However, the actual number of infections is likely to be much higher — approaching 1,000 since the outbreak — he said. This is due to the fact that not everyone with Zika reports symptoms or gets tested in the region, which has only one hospital and four health clinics. And because there are no local laboratories to test for the virus, results can take up to seven weeks to come back from U.S. labs. We're just now getting confirmed case results from the end of summer, Anesi told NBC News. Since the outbreak began last year, health organizations have received over half a million dollars from the federal government to standardize strategies for educating populations at risk for the virus, which can also be transmitted sexually. We want to avoid stigmatization and are trying to make sure that those who are pregnant don't feel isolated. The strategies include the distribution of condoms and insecticides, peer-to-peer education efforts in villages, and offering free prenatal care across the territory. Within the last three months, local clinics have seen an 80 percent increase in women seeking care during their first trimester, Anesi said. All pregnant women who have sought care — now totaling 870 — are tested for the virus, given supplies of insecticide and condoms for the duration of their pregnancy, and followed closely by health officials. But many factors challenge the efforts to reach people outside of the prenatal healthcare system, Anesi said. Prior to the complete subsidization of prenatal care this past summer, the majority of pregnant women in the territory only came to clinics during their third trimester. Women who were in their first trimester last spring when the outbreak began are just now beginning to give birth. We will get a good sense of the penetration of the virus shortly, Anesi said. Microcephaly will be caught as soon as the baby is born, but the department is now also looking at previous births and screening babies regularly for a whole host of developmental issues that can be caused by the virus. Furthermore, the public health advisory messages about prevention are not easy to carry out in the remote, import-based market. Mosquito repellant can cost as much as $8.50 per bottle, while the minimum wage is just $4 per hour, and average individual income is $10,500 per year, according to Anesi. Prof. Michaela Howells — an anthropologist who teaches at the University of North Carolina Wilmington — has researched women's health in American Samoa and studied recent Zika prevention efforts by the federal government. She said that the Zika problem is not only compounded by poverty. Due to widespread conservative Christian values, public discussion of condom use and family planning is minimized in American Samoa. For instance, there is no sex education available in public schools.Access to condoms can also be challenging to groups of people who are expected to not be having sex, including unmarried individuals and those who are underage, she told NBC News. There is concern that having condoms widely available will expose young people to inappropriate sexual information and encourage pre-marital sex. In her work, Howells found that initial Department of Health efforts to distribute condoms over the past summer failed outright, and the supplies were left in the back rooms of clinics. She also noted that the first versions of educational materials about Zika transmission intended for use in local villages did not include images of Samoan people, were not translated into local languages, and explicitly described sexual behavior, so they were rejected by village leaders. The biggest issue was that the materials were not culturally appropriate, Anesi said. Working with the Department of Samoan Affairs, the Health Department eventually created an educational program that was approved by village leaders. But there are other issues that may prove unsurmountable. If a pregnant woman has a confirmed Zika infection, she has no access to abortion, which is only legal in the territory if it will save the mother's life. American Samoan women can fly to Hawaii to terminate their pregnancies, but many cannot afford the trip. If women in the territory start having babies with microcephaly and other Zika-induced symptoms, Howells predicts that the crisis could be exacerbated if public health officials do not incorporate knowledge of Samoan culture into treatment and education options. The reality is that we are about to have a large number of disabled children entering into systems globally, but we don't have the infrastructure for them, she said. Samoans value large extended families, however, disabled children provide an additional social and financial stress on already stretched communities. . . this may disproportionately impact the mothers of affected children, leading to life-long economic deficits for these families. Anesi said the Health Department is working on this. We want to avoid stigmatization and are trying to make sure that those who are pregnant don't feel isolated, and we are building our social services and education capacity so that children affected by Zika will get education and assistance, he said. Howells says that medical anthropologists have been advocating for the integration of culturally sensitive approaches to public health since the 1950s, but the Zika case in American Samoa demonstrates that this is still a pressing issue. She and her colleagues are calling on public health organizations to work closely with local communities to build cultural competency in order to help Zika campaigns succeed. Outside programs are most effective only once they have obtained the support of local medical officials, chiefs, and churches, she said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":709,"title":" Dementia Rates Might Be Declining, New Study Finds","class":1,"body":" Rates of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia appear to have fallen considerably since 2000, and better education may be partly responsible, researchers reported Monday. Better treatment for diabetes and cardiovascular disease may also be helping, the researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Elderly woman covering face with her hands. Dr. Kenneth Langa of the University of Michigan and colleagues studied records from 21,000 people with an average age of 75. While 11.6 percent of Americans aged 65 and older had dementia, based on standardized tests, the rate fell to 8.8 percent in 2012. More years of education was associated with a lower risk for dementia, and average years of education increased significantly, they wrote. Rising levels of education among U.S. adults over the past 25 years may also have contributed to decreased dementia risk. In 2000, the average amount of education was 11.8 years — just short of a full high school education. By 2012, the average was 12.7 years. Our study, along with prior studies, supports the notion that 'cognitive reserve' resulting from early life and lifelong education and cognitive stimulation may be a potent strategy for the primary prevention of dementia in both high- and low-income countries around the world, they wrote. And while obesity, a lack of exercise and poor diet can all raise the risk of Alzheimer's, rates went down as more people got heavier, developed high blood pressure and diabetes, Langa's team found. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's Association says more than 28 million baby boomers will develop the disease between now and 2050, and the cost of caring for them will consume nearly 25 percent of Medicare spending in 2040. Research has shown that increased physical activity, eating a heart-healthy diet, social engagement and keeping the brain active with puzzles or games can help prevent Alzheimer's or at least delay it, and a whole industry has arisen out of that research, with mixed success. The findings fit in with other recent reports that have shown a fall in dementia rates. But the Alzheimer's Association says that doesn't necessarily mean fewer people with Alzheimer's. There is an important difference between prevalence rate (number of people with the disease divided by the total population) and the prevalence number (number of people with the disease), the group said in a statement. Although these recent findings indicate that a person's risk of dementia at any given age may be decreasing slightly, it should be noted that the total number of Americans with Alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to continue to increase dramatically. Nonetheless, it's welcome news in an aging world. There is no cure for dementia, and trials of various treatments have been far from successful. Treating other diseases associated with aging may help. There's plenty of evidence that the same damage that happens as blood vessels get clogged and stiff may underlie dementia. Related: Exercise May Help Alzheimer's Intensity of treatment for diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol level has increased with more patients achieving treatment goals, and a significant decline in the vascular complications of diabetes such as heart attack, stroke and lower-extremity amputations, suggesting that there could be a 'spill-over' benefit of a decline in the vascular-related risk for dementia, Langa's team wrote. Intensity of treatment for diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol level has increased. Rising levels of education among U.S. adults over the past 25 years may also have contributed to decreased dementia risk. The proportion of adults 65 years or older with a high school diploma increased from 55 percent in 1990 to 80 percent in 2010, while the proportion with a college degree increased from 12 percent to 23 percent, they wrote. It's not clear what better education does, but experts note there may be several effects. Better-educated people may have a better ability to adapt to the lost brain function caused by dementia; they may be healthier in general; and they may have better medical care. People who are underweight had a higher-than-usual risk of dementia, the team found. It's possible that weight loss is an early symptom of dementia, Dr. Sanjay Asthana of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health said in a commentary accompanying the study. There is evidence that weight loss may precede the onset of dementia by many years, Asthana and his colleague Ozioma Okonkwo wrote. Dementia can affect the sense of taste and smell and may cause people to eat far too little, they said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":710,"title":" 3-D Scan Lets Parents and Doctors Really See Babies in Womb ","class":1,"body":" Brazilian researchers have fused virtual reality with a new type of 3-D scan to let doctors and parents look at a developing fetus from all angles — even the inside. The idea is to help doctors search for defects that might need immediate treatment, either before or after birth. But other experts say they can see the scan become a pricey toy for wealthy parents-to-be who want something different from the standard blurry ultrasound image. 3D virtual model MRI view of fetus at 26 weeks. Maureen Morley / Radiological Society of North AmericaThe Food and Drug Administration says one ultrasound is enough to make sure a developing fetus is healthy. But more might be necessary if there's reason to believe there is an abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is far more expensive and difficult to do than ultrasound. It's usually only done if there is a real medical question. Dr. Heron Werner of the Clínica de Diagnóstico por Imagem and colleagues in Rio de Janeiro used MRI, advanced computer programs and Oculus Rift to create virtual images that could be navigated in virtual reality. It provides fetal images that are sharper and clearer than ultrasound and MR images viewed on a traditional display, Werner said in a statement. The 3-D fetal models combined with virtual reality immersive technologies may improve our understanding of fetal anatomical characteristics and can be used for educational purposes and as a method for parents to visualize their unborn baby, said Werner, who presented the new technology at a meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. I'm not jumping up for joy on this one because I think we should use medical imaging only when it is medically needed. One video the team made takes the viewer up through the nostril of a fetus, through the sinuses and down into the throat.The physicians can have access to an immersive experience on the clinical case that they are working on, having the whole internal structure of the fetus in 3-D in order to better visualize and share the morphological information, Werner said. Visualization of internal structures at 27 weeks. Maureen Morley / Radiological Society of North America We believe that these images will help facilitate a multidisciplinary discussion about some pathologies in addition to bringing a new experience for parents when following the development of their unborn child. The idea of a new experience for parents worries Dr. Deborah Levine, professor of radiology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. The Brazilian images are beautiful, but do you need those beautiful images to alter your treatment plan? Levine told NBC News. What happened with 3-D ultrasound after it was developed (was) all these shops opened taking pictures for parents, with no medical information. FDA said ultrasound should be performed only when medically necessary, Levine added. Parents had started holding ultrasound parties, with unusual in-utero images going viral on social media. Those shops are still around, and they clearly go against prudent use of ultrasound in pregnancy, but people pay to have pictures taken of their fetuses, Levine said. It provides fetal images that are sharper and clearer than ultrasound and MR images viewed on a traditional display. The danger is that that both prolonged ultrasounds and prolonged MRIs can generate heat that can be harmful to the fetus. At $1,000 or more a pop for a fetal MRI, Levine doesn't see much potential for 3-D MRI parties. While the Brazilian model is technically feasible, it would not really be available to the average parent, she said. I'm not jumping up for joy on this one because I think we should use medical imaging only when it is medically needed."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":711,"title":" The Fight Against AIDS Stigma Is Far from Over, Activists Say","class":1,"body":" Peter Staley was at the top of his game when AIDS took off in New York City in the 1980s. He was a Wall Street bond trader and didn't think the rumor about a disease affecting gay men was anything he needed to worry about. He certainly never could have predicted that it would consume his life. I was a closeted gay man, Staley, 55, told NBC News. I was completely disconnected from the established but mostly closeted gay community that existed in New York that was doing the early struggling against this new epidemic.Gaetan Dugas died of AIDS in 1984. Rand Gaynor Now the HIV pandemic is more than 30 years old, and a new study out this week has put what one expert calls the final nail in the coffin of the idea that a single flight attendant carried HIV across the U.S. Instead, the study shows the virus probably arrived in New York City from the Caribbean around 1970, spreading to San Francisco in 1976 and then to the world.Related: Genetic Study Shows HIV Came to New York in 1970 The report clears the name of Canadian Gaetan Dugas, who died in 1984 after helping Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigators track down HIV.It's shocking how this man's name has been sullied and destroyed by this incorrect history. He was not 'Patient Zero' and this study confirms it through genetic analysis, said Staley, who is currently teaching political activism at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Many Americans expressed horror at the image of an attractive, young, gay flight attendant flying around the world spreading a deadly virus through hundreds — by his own description — of sexual liaisons. The case cast the HIV epidemic even more strongly as a punishment for what many viewed as a sinful lifestyle. Sean Strub isn't surprised by the findings. Strub, who founded POZ magazine, is another survivor of the early AIDS epidemic who understands the stigma then and now has little to do with scientific reality. The neglect and the governmental indifference started long before the epidemic was recognized, Strub told NBC News. From then-President Ronald Reagan on down, no one sounded an alarm about a surge in deaths from a mysterious infectious disease. Reagan's press secretary Larry Speakes openly joked about it. The nonchalance allowed the epidemic to fester. It didn't set off any alarm bells to a young closeted gay man in New York in 1983. And for that I am furious, Staley said. I mostly likely became infected that summer. Staley studied political activism on the streets. America was just letting thousands of its citizens die because of bigotry and hatred, Staley said. America was just letting thousands of its citizens die because of bigotry and hatred. Strub and Staley both learned they were HIV positive in 1985.

Related: Actor Rock Hudson's Death Shifted AIDS conversation Staley at first worked as a bond trader by day and an activist by night. He joined a new group called the AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power (ACT UP) but got sicker and sicker and finally quit his job. The next week, I got arrested. I did my first demo with ACT UP, Staley said. I got 10 arrests during my time in ACT UP. We became the movement of our age. We became the Occupy, the Black Lives Matter of the 80s.

Staley, infected at the beginning of the HIV epidemic in New York in the mid 1980s, quit his job as a Wall Street bond broker and has been a prominent advocate for testing and treatment ever since. Sean Black / Staley The articulate, passionate and highly educated leaders of groups such as ACT UP forced a change in U.S. policies and transformed the research agenda. By 1990, the NIH (National Institutes of Health) was spending over a billion dollars a year on AIDS research, Staley said. We guilt-ripped the whole country into finally reacting. Now there are more than two dozen HIV drugs. While there's no cure for HIV, cocktails of these drugs can control it almost completely, and they've been reformulated into once- or twice-a day pills. People who take them can control the virus so well they almost never infect anyone else. Related: Daily Pills Protect People Against HIV Strub was pulled back from the brink himself, with a ravaged immune system and covered with lesions from Kaposi's sarcoma, when researchers learned they could combine HIV drugs for powerful effect in 1996. It transformed the world for HIV patients, who no longer faced certain death. Most of us didn't think we'd live to see the fruit of our activism, Staley said.While we have incredibly effective medical treatments, we don't have a pill to cure stigma.HIV research has gone mainstream and work on a vaccine gets funding and attention. But Strub and Staley say their fight is far from over. While we have incredibly effective medical treatments, we don't have a pill to cure stigma, said Strub, who is 58. And HIV-related stigma is worse today than it has ever been.Now Strub fights against criminalization of HIV patients as director of The Sero Project. Today, with disclosure, you risk losing your job. You risk partner violence. Women fear disclosing for fear of losing her children, said Strub. Strub's group fights laws that make it a crime for an HIV-positive person to have sex with anyone without disclosing it — laws they say that have been abused by angry ex-partners, who can accuse HIV patients who have no way of proving whether they disclosed. These laws, and a continued high level of discrimination among the general public, have driven the HIV epidemic underground, Strub says. People resist getting tested for fear of being prosecuted later. The evidence is these laws are harming public health, he said. Infections are at an all-time high among gay men, he added. The rates are rising among young gay men of color. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirm this. Today, with disclosure, you risk losing your job. You risk partner violence. The CDC reports that, at current rates, one in six men who have sex with men will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetimes. Gay and bisexual men in Southern cities are at the highest risk. We are not surrounded with the same kind of death and dying that was such a part of our daily lives. But that has helped erase it from the public's consciousness, Strub said. It isn't fashionable any more. But it is still very much a crisis. And many communities have been utterly neglected.Related: Gay, Bisexual Black men have 50 Percent HIV Risk Staley says the worsening political divide in the United States has taken the epidemic in new directions. The stigma is as bad as ever, he said. I call it Red AIDS and Blue AIDS. In mostly Democratic areas of the country — large cities in the Northeast and California — state health departments are pushing widespread HIV testing and treatment that have pushed new infections down. Staley said Washington, D.C., has seen a 40 percent drop in the past decade, while San Francisco has seen a 50 percent drop in the past decade. It is back like the 1980s again, where apathy and ignorance and stigma are just letting the epidemic rage on. In these blue areas of the country that are using the current scientific tools, we are seeing great progress. It is the red areas, especially the deep South, where the epidemic is either flat or getting worse, he said. Related: Southern, Urban Gay Men More Likely to Have HIV Republican-led states have fought some of the innovations proven to slow the spread of HIV and other infections. For instance, Indiana bans needle exchanges, although last year Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican now running for vice president, issued an executive order allowing temporary needle exchanges after an outbreak of HIV among injecting drug users in his state. Related: CDC Says Urgent Action Needed in Indiana It's frustrating when you have these tools and large parts of the country are not using them at all, Staley said. Lives are being lost because we just don't have the money and the political will to make it work. In the United States, more than 1.2 million people have HIV, and about 50,000 people are newly infected each year. It is back like the 1980s again, where apathy and ignorance and stigma are just letting the epidemic rage on, Staley said. I am an AIDS activist still and trying to finish the job we started in the late 1980s."}

They're what Thanksgiving Day is all about, but they sometimes seem in short supply after an election that frayed nerves and divided families. And each news cycle brings another array of headlines that test people's resolve. Nicole and Christian have seen a much different America, one filled with kind, loving and selfless people. From hugs and stuffed animals to donations and messages of support, the parents have been left in awe. Donations to their GoFundMe page to cover the boys' medical expenses have skyrocketed from about $50,000 before the surgery to nearly $300,000. Nicole McDonald laughs with son Anias as he recovers from separation surgery. Nicole McDonald laughs with son Anias as he recovers from separation surgery. The parents don't quite understand the outpouring. They wonder: Why us? Why our boys? But a nice note from a single stranger can turn an excruciating day -- one filled with tears -- into a more optimistic one. The messages come almost daily via Facebook or in the mail. Most carry similar themes: I think about your boys and pray for them every day. When you're just about running out of gas, it's the constant fuel that not only feels good because people care so much, it rejuvenates me in a way that I can't explain, Nicole says. Christian says he appreciates people's prayers more than anything. I know God hears prayers, he says. I think our prayers did influence God to help out. And that is their message this Thanksgiving: Use the positivity shown to their boys and roll that energy into doing something good for others. In their case, the parents have asked that donations be made to a friend whose child is in need of a kidney transplant. So much has been given to their family, they want to pay it forward. Instead of seeing the ugly hearts of people, I get to see the best hearts of people all the time, Nicole says. And it shows me continually that most people are good. We get this perception that most people aren't, but what I'm seeing is so amazing to me. Nicole and Christian McDonald with 3-year-old son Aza and the twins before surgery. Nicole and Christian McDonald with 3-year-old son Aza and the twins before surgery. In no way has their journey been easy. Nicole, 31, and Christian, 37, moved with the twins and their 3-year-old son, Aza, from their Illinois town of 5,000 to the Bronx to be near the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center. They quit their jobs and gave all their attention to their children. Seemingly every second of every day has been spent thinking about the twins, first before the surgery and then after. When we do something, we're going to do it fully and with our whole heart and to the best of our ability, Nicole says. And if that means sacrificing self for as long as we need to give our children the chance they need to thrive in life, then it's the best thing I've ever given up myself for.Adds Christian, We've really served our boys a lot and basically put our lives on hold for our boys and put them first. There have been many firsts since the 27-hour surgery ended on October 14: the first time the twins slept in separate beds. The first time they saw each other face to face. The first time they were held. Holding each child separately was surreal and beautiful for Nicole. Jadon was the first one she held. He just got quiet, and I just rocked him, and it was great. Great isn't even the right word. I don't know a word, she says. New life, apart: Conjoined twins separated in marathon surgery Anias was different. He was crying and fussy one night about 6 p.m. when she first held him, putting him on her shoulder. When that did little to calm him, she moved him into the crook of her arm.He stopped crying instantly, and he looked up with me with those two huge brown eyes and just watched my face. I rocked him back and forth. I could feel his whole body just loosen. When they were conjoined, the twins were confined to a single bed. When one child needed to be consoled, Nicole found it hard to give him her full attention. Her eyes would shift back and forth, and she could never focus on one baby. She thought of that as Anias -- who has struggled more than Jadon since the surgery -- fell asleep in her arms. I was singing to him, and I was able to just focus on his face, and his eyes would flutter, close and then pop open to make sure I was still there. He was just as amazed with me as I was with him. Yet between the moments of firsts have been moments of anguish. The boys have battled infections, fevers and seizures. Infections near Anias' brain forced doctors to remove the skull cap they had fashioned out of the boys' conjoined skull. His scalp is now the only thing covering the top of his head. He will eventually undergo more surgery to have a new skull cap inserted, but that is years down the road. Until then, he will wear a protective helmet. Separated twins: After hardest surgery, the quickest recovery The parents try to focus on the positive. Both boys are progressing faster than any other craniopagus twins who've undergone surgery. Both are beginning to show signs of their old selves: Jadon, the rambunctious one, and Anias, the contemplative one. Mom spends almost all her time in their room. Dad tends to 3-year-old Aza, does the laundry, fetches groceries and makes sure the bills get paid. As if worrying about the twins wasn't enough, Aza recently got hand, foot and mouth disease. That forced his parents to be away from the twins for five days to make sure Jadon and Anias didn't get sick. Nicole, Christian and Aza went to Boston, to visit a city they had never been to before. Nicole is actually thankful Aza got sick: It gave me time with him for a change. On Thursday, at the family's temporary Bronx home, Nicole will prepare a donated turkey and other traditional Thanksgiving favorites. Her grandparents will join them for the feast. They won't dwell on their worries. They'll emphasize their gratitude. When you're in huge rough patches of life, you can either focus on the tough, or you can find the things to be grateful for, Nicole says. And in doing so, we're able to get through it in a positive way. Their wish this day is that America will do the same."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":713,"title":" Eli Lilly's promising Alzheimer's drug fails in clinical trial","class":1,"body":" (CNN)A large trial of a drug to treat dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease has ended in failure after people receiving the treatment showed no significant improvements to those taking a placebo. The failure of the much anticipated drug, which showed promise in earlier results, is being seen as a disappointing setback, but not the end of hopes to fight the disease.On Wednesday, US drugmaker Eli Lilly announced that the Phase 3 clinical trial of its drug solanezumab did not progress as planned. Patients treated with solanezumab did not experience a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline compared to patients treated with placebo, the company said in a statement. Almost 47 million people live with dementia worldwide and that number is expected to double every 20 years to reach 131 million people in 2050, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is estimated to account for 60 to 80 percent of dementia casesCan you avoid Alzheimer's?Can you avoid Alzheimer's? While two well-established risk factors for Alzheimer's are genetics and aging, there is hope that adopting healthy brain life habits might delay or prevent the appearance of Alzheimer's disease, the association says. Here are some tips: Stay physically active to maintain good blood flow to the brain and encourage new brain cells. Eat a brain-healthy diet low in fat and cholesterol.Stay social to reduce stress levels and maintain healthy brain cell connections. Stay mentally active to strengthen brain cells and the connections between them. More than 2,100 patients diagnosed with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's participated in the multi-national trial, called EXPEDITION3, which began in 2013. In a statement, Lilly's chairman, president and CEO John C. Lechleiter said the company was disappointed for the millions of people waiting for a potential disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease. He added that the results would be evaluated to determine the impact on its other potential Alzheimer's drugs in the pipeline. The company's share price dropped more than 10% on the New York Stock Exchange after the announcement. More details are expected to be announced on Thursday. How Alzheimer&#39;s destroys the brainHow Alzheimer's destroys the brain 01:38Attacking amyloid plaques Like other anti-amyloid drugs, solanezumab was designed to reduce the build up of amyloid plaques on the brain, which are thought to contribute to the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease. The results now bring that underlying biology into question. The failure of this trial is something that could be another step back for the amyloid theory, said Professor Bryce Vissel, Roth Fellow and Director of the Centre for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). However, while disappointing, the results will spur the scientific community to examine other potential cures for the disease, he said. Game shows that ability to navigate declines at young age One could call it the beginning of a next generation of efforts for treatment for Alzheimer's, he said. We're getting a much deeper understanding of the disease and a more robust approach to curing it. Ultimately, this will bring about approaches to solve the disease within our lifetime. Dr Mark Dallas, Lecturer in Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience at the University of Reading agreed. While this is disappointing news, we will have to wait for the full data set to see if there are any nuggets of information that provide insight into the lack of effect of solanezumab, he said. It's another setback for the Alzheimer's community, however the information we obtain from these setbacks is vital in our common goal of generating a novel treatment to tackle Alzheimer's disease. Is new Alzheimer&#39;s drug a &#39;game-changer?&#39; Vissel said attention had now turned to the next big trial of a drug called aducanumab by Biogen, which works by attacking plaques from another angle. The drug showed promise from preliminary results announced in September, though final results are still a while away. For many, the failure of Lilly's solanezumab trials wasn't surprising. There is still no convincing evidence that shows a clear relationship between amyloid deposition and deficits in cognition in humans, said Professor Peter Roberts from the University of Bristol. US dementia rates drop 24% All we really know is that evidence of amyloid deposition begins up to maybe 20 years before the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This might be a good indicator, but does not prove causality. This is disappointing but not a great surprise, added Robert Howard, Professor of Old Age Psychiatry at UCL who believes the decades of failed drug trials highlight the challenge that still lies ahead. What we have learned from several decades of research and hundreds of failed Alzheimer's disease trials is that no matter how promising the basic and early phase data, all that really matters is the results of these late phase effectiveness trials. The US Alzheimer's Association said it hoped ongoing tests for solanezumab and other anti-amyloid agents would continue.These other programs have different ways of acting on the amyloid pathway and some are also addressing the disease at a much earlier stage when these drugs may still prove to be effective, it said. As populations increasingly live into their older years, the need to tackle the problem remains. Dementia is society's biggest health challenge and we've seen time and again that developing effective treatments is incredibly difficult, said Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive of Alzheimer's Society. This is only one drug of several in the pipeline and they aim to tackle dementia in different ways, so we should not lose hope. Dementia can and will be beaten."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":714,"title":"  South Korea scandal: Can Viagra help with altitude sickness? ","class":1,"body":" High-altitude mountaineers and a biochemistry expert told CNN Viagra was sometimes used by climbers to avoid altitude sickness, although its usefulness has yet to be clinically proven. Veteran Australian mountaineer Andrew Lock, who has climbed all 14 of the world's 8,000 meter peaks, told CNN he first heard of climbers discuss using Viagra for pulmonary edemas about 10 years ago. A pulmonary edema occurs when there is an accumulation of fluid in the lungs at altitude, making it hard to breath and potentially leading to death. Climber: Mount Everest a very dangerous place Climber: Mount Everest a very dangerous place 05:15 The benefit in terms of climbing is if someone is suffering altitude sickness ... that particular drug will help you dilate those blood vessels and carry that fluid away from the lungs, because if you don't get that fluid out you can actually drown in (them), he said. Lock said while the primary cure for a severe pulmonary edema was to descend, Viagra could help slow its development until you climb lower. I've carried it myself for that purpose, he said. New Zealander Guy Cotter, chief executive of mountain climbing guide company Adventure Consultants, said he knew the drug had been tested at high altitudes but didn't believe the results had proven to be negative or positive. We joke that the best use of Viagra on an expedition is to stop the blokes rolling out of bed at night, he said. Medical opinion divided According to the Institute for Altitude Medicine's website, altitude illness can refer to three different problems: acute mountain sickness, high altitude cerebral edema and high altitude pulmonary edema. For a pulmonary edema, the institute said while Viagra is sometimes used for treatment, it hasn't been proven conclusively to help. Speaking to CNN, biochemistry lecturer at Australia's Murdoch University, Dr Garth Maker, said from a molecular mechanism perspective, Viagra could be potentially used to treat altitude sickness. It dilates the blood vessels therefore you get a drop in blood pressure. So there is certainly a basis for it (but) from what I can see the general consensus is that it's very much a 'maybe' at the moment, he said. Maker said there were other more commonly used drugs for altitude sickness. South Korea&#39;s President Park Geun-Hye speaking at the presidential Blue House in Seoul on November 4, 2016.

{"id":715,"title":" The villain in your fridge: 5 ways to avoid food poisoning","class":1,"body":" (CNN)Most people have experienced that unfortunate feeling in their gut making them run in search of the nearest bathroom. The cause was most likely a delicious meal the previous day -- now deeply regretted in hindsight. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 48 million Americans -- 1 in 6 people -- get sick from foodborne illnesses each year, with 128,000 hospitalized and 3000 dying from consuming contaminated food.In reality, the numbers are likely to be much higher as most people don't visit their doctor due to bouts of diarrhea -- they instead prefer to suffer in silence. But if people become complacent with their eating and hygiene habits, the number of infections will go up courtesy of multiple bacteria growing wildly in foods before they're eaten. We've put together six common sense ways to avoid food poisoning and the key bacteria behind it -- a crib sheet to keep to hand in the kitchen. 1) Don't leave your food out Food left out at room temperature for hours at a time -- be it at home, a cookout (barbeque), a party, or a restaurant buffet -- is a prime source of food poisoning. The spores and toxins released by bacteria commonly found on food can flourish at this temperature. How long can you eat those leftovers? [The spores] thrive in the 'danger zone' of 40-140 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 60 degrees Celsius), says Gabrielle Judd, a registered dietician with the University of Maryland Medical Center. Judd works with transplant patients whose reduced immunity puts them at greater risk from infections -- increasing the importance of them eating wisely. The main spore-producing bacteria are Clostridium perfringens -- among the most common causes of food poisoning in the United States. Another culprit multiplying and producing toxins at room temperature is Bacillus, found commonly in rice, soups, sauces and leftovers. Judd refers to these bugs as cookout bugs as this is a typical situation where food is prepared and left out for hours at a time. Food should not be out for more than two hours at a time, she says. On the plus side, infections with these bacteria are unlikely to hospitalize you, but instead leave you poorly for 24 hours. For this same reason, cases of illness often go unreported. So as spring approaches and brings with it potential for weekend cookouts, don't forget to use your refrigerator. 2) Be wary of raw poultry How to cook a Thanksgiving turkey At least half of all raw chicken carcasses carry significant levels of campylobacter, says bacteriologist Andrew Roe from the University of Glasgow, who states more than 500,000 cases of food poisoning in the U.K. are caused by these chicken-loving bacteria. This group of bacteria cause the majority of foodborne infections in the developed world as the bacteria are prevalent in the food chain itself. Four out of five cases [of food poisoning] are from contaminated poultry, says Roe. Poultry expands beyond chicken, with infection also common in other commonly consumed birds with which people may be less vigilant in terms of hygiene.Turkey and duck are often highly contaminated with Campylobacter so the advice would be to treat them exactly as you would chicken, says Roe. Judd adds that food borne illness likely comes from improper thawing/preparation of meats. Not just prunes: foods to help you get regular Luckily, infection is usually self-controlling, meaning people don't get severely ill but instead recover over time. This low harm associated with infections is why the bacteria are not prioritized for removal from the food chain -- unlike salmonella which chickens in the UK are now all vaccinated against. The solution? Wash your hands when handling poultry, avoid contaminating surfaces and thoroughly cook your meat. Basically, avoid any risk of raw meat entering your body. The best way to avoid infection is to make sure all chicken is cooked thoroughly [and] you have good kitchen practices, says Roe. 3) Learn the perils of minced meats Chicken is not the only villain among the animal kingdom. Roe advises to step away from your burger if there is any suspicion about its status as cooked -- minced meat can be a potent source of infection. Step away from the burger: Why a &#39;Western&#39; diet is bad for your health Mince products are inherently more risky, says Roe. The danger lies in the grinding together of meat -- and the increased likelihood of surface bacteria mixing deep into your meat -- unlike with a piece of steak. A steak is an intact piece of meat. Any contamination will be on the surface, says Roe. Cooking a steak well on the outside therefore reduces your chances of infection, even if it remains rare inside. But with minced meat the bacteria are mixed into the blend. This applies to any form of burger, be it gourmet or a simple slider handed out as a canapé. With ground meat the outside mixes up with all the meat and contaminates the rest, agrees Judd. Burgers -- a cook-out favourite -- combined with the uncontrolled heat of a barbeque through intense, uncontrolled, flames bring a high risk of being cooked on the outside, but raw in the middle.People can be quite flippant, but these are the times you're increasing your risk, says Roe. The solution? If you love your burgers, make sure you eat them well-done Be prepared to reject food if not cooked thoroughly, says Roe 4) Don't forget to wash your fruit The first thoughts when assigning blame to a bout of food poisoning commonly go towards meat and poultry, but your fruits and vegetables aren't as safe as you think. Five ways to eat yourself healthier A 2013 study by the CDC found that 46% of foodborne illnesses in the U.S are caused by fruits, vegetables and nuts. Leafy vegetables were found to cause the most illness, accounting for 22% of all cases in the study -- aided by the fact that bacteria, like E. coli, can live within the leaf tissue itself There's less perceived risk [with fruits and vegetables] so people are more blasé, says Roe. Many forms of bacteria are found naturally on the surfaces -- or skins -- of fruits and vegetables which need washing off before consumption. If not, that slice down the middle can bring those surface bacteria deep down inside the fruit. Judd advises the same rules be applied to all foods with outer skins or rinds -- such as oranges, watermelons or cucumbers. Most people wash off an apple but with melons assume they don't have to, says Judd. When cutting or peeling such foods, bacteria on the surface can easily spread inside. If peeled and washed thoroughly you can reduce your risk quite significantly, adds Roe. 5) Reheat your leftovers properly The risk of reheating rice is a common myth propagated as a means of food poisoning -- linked with bacillus bacteria found commonly in paddy fields and likely to be present in those rice grains. The bacteria are killed when the rice is cooked, but their spores stay alive and flourish if then left out at room temperature. The spores grow back into bacteria, says Roe. The solution? Rice should be steaming hot when reheated, to ensure any returning bacteria have died. These rules apply for reheated food in general to prevent any new bacteria from thriving -- both on your food and in your intestine. Illness comes from improper management of leftovers, says Judd who also advises not to keep leftovers for more than 3 to 4 days. If you're served something that's inadequately hot...be brave enough to say you're not happy with it, says Roe. Have you got the (healthy) guts to make a stand."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":716,"title":" The doctor on the front line of the migrant crisis ","class":1,"body":" (CNN)For 25 years, Dr. Pietro Bartolo has greeted the waves of migrants who land on the shores of Lampedusa, a tiny Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea. He looks the migrants in the eye, discerns who needs medical attention and deduces how he can help ease their suffering. And no matter the circumstances, he does his best to make jokes that help them forget their burdens for a moment. Photographer Stefano Schirato discovered Bartolo and his story in the Oscar-nominated documentary Fire at Sea. It shows the contrast between Lampedusa's 6,000 inhabitants and the migrants from Africa and the Middle East hoping for a new life in Europe. The doctor is tirelessly passionate about his work. He is the director of the island's health services, but he has spent the majority of his time and efforts aiding migrants. Even before the politics and thinking whether it is right or not if these migrants come to Italy, you should see with your own eyes the inhuman conditions in which they arrive, Bartolo told Schirato. And the dead, the women, the burned and the children who die at sea. The first thing you must do is to help them not to die. The rest are details. As he documented Bartolo's story, Schirato noticed that Bartolo never seems overwhelmed by the fact that he's usually the only doctor in these situations. He also performs autopsies on those who have died, gathering DNA so family members can identify them. He continues undeterred to go on the front line, Schirato said. The only thing he often wonders is, 'Why (has) nobody ever asked me if I needed a psychologist?' Bartolo also opened a center for those with schizophrenia and behavioral issues and manages it with psychologists and psychiatrists. Schirato realized that it was born out of an act of love because Bartolo's brother, who was mentally disabled, suffered from the same issues. Schirato aimed to remain invisible as he shadowed Bartolo from day to day. He wanted to tell the story in stark black-and-white images, which Schirato finds fitting for the various migrant projects he has worked on. Rather than describe the landscape in color, he wants to capture the range of emotions. He has been following the migrant crisis for the last two years, hoping that his lens can help others see the personal stories amid an anonymous crowd. He believes that his images zoom into an infinite and indefinite human flood. All this leaves you so angry, it leaves you with emptiness in your gut. A hole, Bartolo says in the trailer for Fire at Sea. The Italian Chamber of Deputies has asked Schirato to exhibit his work showcasing the refugee crisis. Although this was an emotional project for the photographer, he enjoys witnessing the lives of people who are passionate about what they do. Being with Pietro was like looking inside an epochal tragedy, much bigger than me, Schirato said. And to live it, to be personally involved. I cried with him for the stories of children who died, and at the same time, I was impressed by his hospitality and authenticity. Stefano Schirato is an Italian photographer based in Pescara, Italy. You can follow him on Facebook."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":717,"title":" Why your child doesn't wear a seat belt on the school bus ","class":1,"body":" (CNN)Parents in Chattanooga, Tennessee, are mourning the deaths of at least five children whose lives were cut short when their school bus smashed into a tree and split apart on Monday. The 24-year-old driver, who police said has been cooperative and talking to investigators, has been arrested and charged with vehicular homicide. As the investigation continues, many people across the country are left with questions -- such as, could lives have been saved if the school bus were equipped with seat belts? At least 5 dead in school bus crash At least 5 dead in school bus crash 01:14 There's no federal mandate that requires children to wear seat belts on school buses, and only six states -- New York, California, Florida, New Jersey, Louisiana and Texas (PDF) -- have laws requiring school buses to be equipped with seat belts for passengers. The American Academy of Pediatrics has long recommended that passenger seat belts be installed on newly manufactured school buses. The National Safety Council also has made similar recommendations, said Deborah Hersman, its president and CEO, on CNN's New Day on Tuesday morning. That's the best protection that we can give our kids. It's what they're used to in cars, Hersman said. We know that there are very few fatalities involving children on school buses every year -- they are a safe form of transportation -- but anything that we can do to make them safer is really our responsibility. Some experts say that buses are already considered to be safe and that adding seat belts can be costly. Although nearly 500 children and teens die each year in car accidents during school travel hours, only about four are killed while riding school buses during those same hours, according to a 2014 report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (PDF). U.S. has highest car crash death rate, despite progress, CDC says The average incremental cost of equipping a large school bus with seat belts would be between $7,346 and $10,296, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated at a public meeting last year (PDF). A lot of it has to do with the communities that are responsible for replacing or buying those school buses, Hersman said. I do think that you have to follow the money. We're talking about a couple thousand dollars for each new bus that's purchased. Yet the NHTSA argues that the addition of three-point seat belts could help make school buses even safer, reducing the average number of lives lost annually in school bus crashes from four to two. In 2011, the Department of Transportation decided not to pursue a proposed rule requiring the installation of three-point seat belts on school buses nationwide, said Richard Williams, former director of the regulatory studies program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Installing seat belts on buses is not free, and requiring their installation might mean reducing funding on other critical safety aspects, such as crossing guards for those children who do walk to school, Williams said. But this is a decision each community must make for their own children, he said. There are very, very few deaths of children from school bus accidents, and there may be other expenditures that will be better investments to reduce risk. A comparable -- non-fatal -- crash In 2014, a school bus in Anaheim, California, slammed into a light pole and trees, splitting open on its left side, while carrying students home from El Rancho Charter Middle School -- strikingly similar to this week's crash in Chattanooga. In both incidents, the drivers were 24 years old, conditions were clear and dry, and the buses turned over on their sides. However, the bus in the California crash was equipped with seat belts, and no one died. The proper use of seat belts by student passengers in that crash reduced the severity of their injuries, the National Transportation Safety Board noted in its highway accident brief report (PDF).But now, in the wake of the Chattanooga tragedy, Williams calls for a conversation that's much broader than the seat belt debate. School bus safety is critically important, and that is why we must study all possible avenues for making buses safer rather than limiting the conversation to seat belts, Williams said. It's also important to focus on safe driving and ensuring that all drivers, particularly school bus drivers, are properly screened and trained."}

Jessica Whelan, of Clayton-le-Moors, England, was 4. I feel both sadness and relief in informing you all that Jessica finally found peace at 7 o'clock this morning, wrote her father, Andy Whelan. No longer does she suffer, no longer does she feel the pain of the physical constraints of her body. Now my princess has grown her angel wings and has gone up to play with her friends and loved ones. She will now watch down over her little brother and ourselves until one day we are reunited again. More than 100,000 people had signed up to get updates of Jessica's battle with neuroblastoma after she was diagnosed in September 2015, and they followed along as she underwent treatment for the disease. But it was a black and white photo her father posted in October that seemed to affect people the most. In it, Jessica can be seen with tears rolling down her cheeks, her eyes closed as her body tenses upward in pain. With this photo I do not mean to offend or upset. I do mean however to educate and shock those that see it in it's context, he wrote. Perhaps by seeing this photo people not in our position will be made aware of the darkness that is childhood cancer, perhaps these same people may be able to do something about it so that in the future no child has to suffer this pain, so that no parent has to bear witness to their own flesh and blood deteriorating daily. Neuroblastoma, a cancer that is typically found in children age 5 or younger, most often forms in adrenal glands, but can also be found in the neck, chest or spinal cord. If this photograph only serves as a purpose to make people think twice about this evil and put into perspective what it does to a child then it has achieved its purpose, her father wrote. Research needs to be done, cures need to be found, too long now has this been allowed to happen. Please I beg of you, as a heartbroken father, it is too late for my daughter, but childhood cancer needs to be cured. No family should have to go through this hell."}

So it's fair to say that the task of finding acceptable healthy options from BK's menu is a bit challenging. Red, fried and processed meats aside, there are a few items that stand out in terms of their healthfulness, so much so that we mentioned those options for more than one category. For example, the garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken is one of the healthiest options on BK's menu, along with the protein-rich Tendergrill chicken sandwich. Regardless of meal type, the Tendergrill chicken is always a better choice than the Tendercrisp chicken, which is fried. And then there's the veggie burger, for those who want to avoid meat. Healthy fast food switches that will surprise you Healthy fast food switches that will surprise you 01:22 We recommend steering clear of bacon, found in many of the chain's cheese-containing burgers, and other processed meats, such as sausage (found in eight of the chain's breakfast sandwiches) and hot dogs. And while the Whopperrito -- the newest addition to Burger King's menu -- may sound tempting, the mixture of beef and queso sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla offers about half a day's worth of saturated fat and sodium. If you want to splurge on fries or onion rings, choose the value size, which will make a much smaller dent in your daily calorie and sodium limits. For example, a large order of onion rings has 500 calories and 1,310 milligrams of sodium, or more than triple the calories and sodium than the value size portion, which has 150 calories and 400 milligrams of sodium. For a healthier side dish, choose the sodium-free applesauce for just 50 calories. As with other chains, avoid sugar-sweetened beverages. The smallest size, a 16-ounce soft drink, contains about 40 grams or 10 teaspoons of sugar. A 40-ounce cup has more than 100 grams, or more than 25 teaspoons. According to the American Heart Association, women should limit added sugars to no more than 6 teaspoons of sugar per day and men about 9 teaspoons. US dietary guidelines recommend a limit of 10% of calories from added sugars; on a 2,000-calorie diet, that translates to 12½ teaspoons. Below are the best Burger King options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu. We break it down by our picks for kids, athletes, drivers, vegetarians and vegans, as well as low-calorie, low-sugar, low-salt, gluten-free and low-carb options. Our picks: Chicken Nuggets King Jr. meal (4 pieces) with ketchup, applesauce and fat-free milk When it comes to kid-specific lunch and dinner, choices at Burger King include chicken nuggets, a hamburger or a cheeseburger. The chicken nuggets are lowest in saturated fat: A four-piece serving has 2 grams of saturated fat, compared with 3 grams for the hamburger and 5 grams for the cheeseburger. A packet of kid-friendly ketchup for dipping is a welcome alternative to some of the higher-sodium sauces and has fewer sugars than the barbecue sauce. Chipotle&#39;s menu, as curated by a nutritionist We like the fact that the King Jr. meal comes with applesauce and a choice of a beverage, though we highly recommend the fat-free milk over the apple juice, which has 20 grams (5 teaspoons) of sugar. You don't have to deny your child dessert, but be smart: The vanilla soft serve ice cream cone has 140 calories and 3 grams of saturated fat and is a better option than the chocolate fudge sundae, with 270 calories and 5 grams of saturated fat, or the vanilla milkshake, with 580 calories and 10 grams of saturated fat. Our picks: Morningstar Veggie Burger without mayo, ketchup or pickles and garden side salad without croutons and dressing For those who want a meat-free meal, Burger King offers a Morningstar veggie burger (like the one found in supermarket freezers), topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, ketchup and mayo. But the condiments come at a cost: With all of the fixings, the sodium count registers at 1,060 milligrams. If you take away the mayo, ketchup and pickles, you can slash 240 milligrams of sodium. Add a garden side salad if you desire, but skip the croutons and dressing, which add even more sodium to the meal. Our picks: Garden side salad without cheese or croutons and with Golden Italian dressing, applesauce and French fries (value size) Aside from French fries, hash browns and French toast sticks, there isn't much to choose from when it comes to vegan options at Burger King. Though the veggie burger may be a welcome option for vegetarians, the same cannot be said for vegans, as the patty contains eggs and milk. You could theoretically fill a bun with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and romaine, but be prepared to be hungry soon after, as it won't provide much protein. The best we can recommend is a garden side salad (without cheese, croutons or egg-yolk-containing ranch dressing) with a side of applesauce. And if you feel like splurging, go for value size fries. Our picks: Tendergrill chicken sandwich without mayo; or veggie burger without mayo, ketchup and pickles; or garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken, without dressing Believe it or not, there are many low-calorie items at Burger King. Our favorite is the Tendergrill chicken sandwich without mayo. It has only 320 calories, but we really like the fact that it delivers 32 grams of protein and will keep you satisfied long after the meal, which is especially important if you are limiting calories. Panera Bread&#39;s menu as curated by a nutritionist The veggie burger without mayo, pickles and ketchup is another appealing option, with 300 calories and 21 grams of protein. (Although the ketchup and pickles don't contribute many calories, cutting them brings the sodium count down by 170 milligrams.) And if you are willing to part with salad dressing, the garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken has only 320 calories and 36 grams of protein. If part of your enjoyment of salad includes the dressing, use only half a packet. BK's Lite honey balsamic dressing is one of the lowest, at 120 calories per packet. Note: Don't look at calories in isolation, as some of the least healthy items on BK's menu are also some of the lowest-calorie options. A bacon cheeseburger has fewer than 300 calories, but it has less protein and more saturated fat than the Tendergrill chicken sandwich without mayo or the veggie burger. And we don't recommend processed meats like bacon or a grilled hot dog, which has only 310 calories. If you are in the mood for a burger, go for a Whopper Jr., which has about half the calories of a regular Whopper. Our picks: Garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken, with a half packet of ranch dressing; or chicken nuggets (6 pieces) with ranch dipping sauce The garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken has just 1 teaspoon (or 4 grams) of sugar and is one of the lowest-sugar items on BK's menu. Though it comes with Lite balsamic vinaigrette dressing, the dressing appears to contribute 3 grams of sugar for every 2 tablespoons. We recommend the ranch dressing instead, which has only 1 gram of sugar per packet (use half the packet to limit sodium intake). The chicken nuggets are also sugar-free; however, steer clear of the barbecue dipping sauce, which has 2½ teaspoons (10 grams) of sugar per serving. The ranch, buffalo and zesty onion ring dipping sauces are lowest in sugars. Each has 1 gram per serving, though the ranch is lowest in sodium of the three sauces. We were tempted to include the original chicken sandwich without mayo, as it is also one of the lowest-sugar options on the menu, but it has close to 1,000 milligrams of sodium, even without the creamy condiment. Our picks: Whopper Jr. without mayo, ketchup and pickles; or chicken nuggets (4 pieces), garden side salad without croutons and dressing; and applesauce There's something to be said about junior sizes. They are guaranteed to have fewer nutrients across the board, compared with their regular-size counterparts. And in the case of sodium, that's a significant savings. A regular Whopper sandwich has 810 milligrams of sodium, but when you order the junior size, the count is cut by more than half, down to 390 milligrams, making it one of the lowest-sodium meals on BK's menu. Taking away the mayo, ketchup and pickles brings the sodium count down further, from 390 to 230 milligrams. Another low-sodium option is the four-piece chicken nuggets, at 310 milligrams, though we recommend skipping the sodium-laden dipping sauces. Pair them with the garden side salad to add some vitamins, but skip the croutons and dressing for a significant sodium savings. Though fries and onion rings are sodium saboteurs, you can enjoy a cup of sodium-free applesauce as a snack. For the gluten-sensitive Our picks: Garden grilled salad with Tendergrill chicken and without croutons and with Lite honey balsamic dressing; or Whopper Jr. without bun Burger King cautions that although some of its foods may be free of gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, rye and oats, they are not intended for those with celiac disease, due to the risk of contamination. Even French fries, while gluten-free, may be fried along with gluten-containing foods. When it comes to meals without gluten, the options are pretty much limited to burgers without buns and salads without croutons and meat patties. Smoothies are available too, but they will max you out on added sugar for the entire day. We like the garden fresh salad with Tendergrill chicken (minus the croutons). The Lite honey balsamic dressing is one of the lowest-calorie dressings and is gluten-free. Our picks: Flame-grilled chicken burger without mayo and pickles, fat-free milk or low-fat chocolate milk For those who make spin classes, jogging or going to the gym a regular part of their weekly routine, the flame-grilled chicken burger is a welcome alternative to a beef burger and offers a balanced combination of carbs and protein to fuel and repair muscles during workouts. We omitted the mayo and pickles to bring down the sodium count, though if you perspire a lot, you can afford more sodium, as some of the mineral is lost in sweat. To drink, choose low-fat milk, which offers even more protein and carbs, along with bone-building calcium. And if you are running long distances, the low-fat chocolate milk will give you even more carbs to replenish muscles. Our picks: Big fish sandwich, without tartar sauce and with half the bun; or Tendergrill chicken sandwich without mayo If you are on a road trip, you might be eating away from home at least for a day or two. Whether you're visiting friends, looking forward to a weekend getaway or even attending an out-of-town business conference, our guess is that you may be surrounded by high-calorie indulgences when it comes to foods and drinks. So we couldn't pass up the fish sandwich at Burger King. After all, it's rich in heart-healthy omega-3 fats and relatively low in calories and saturated fat, especially when you skip the tartar sauce. The sodium is on the higher side, but you can save some milligrams by taking off the top of the brioche bun and eating the sandwich open-faced. For longer trips, choose the Tendergrill chicken sandwich without mayo, with 32 grams of protein to keep you satisfied and focused. For the carb-conscious Our picks: Tendergrill chicken sandwich without bun; or cheeseburger without bun; plus garden side salad with ranch dressing and without croutons When you look beyond burgers, sandwiches, fries and onion rings, you won't find many low-carb options on Burger King's menu. The foods with the fewest carbs include the chicken nuggets -- a six-piece serving has 16 grams (four pieces have 11 grams) -- and the garden grilled chicken salad with Tendergrill chicken, which also contains 16 grams of carbs, without the dressing. If you want to keep your carb consumption at a minimum, your best bet is to order the Tendergrill chicken sandwich and toss the bun. You'll save on sodium too, as the brioche bun for the chicken sandwich has more than 300 milligrams. Another low-carb option is the bun-less cheeseburger. Pair either with a garden side salad, minus the croutons, and choose the ranch dressing, which has only 2 grams of carbs per packet. Our picks: Original maple-flavored oatmeal; or egg and cheese Croissan'wich Once you eliminate processed breakfast meats, high-sodium biscuit sandwiches and oversized portions, there isn't a whole lot to choose from on BK's breakfast menu. We like the heart-healthy maple-flavored oatmeal best because it's low in sodium and saturated fat. If you prefer more protein at breakfast, we recommend the egg and cheese Croissan'wich, though avoid adding ham, which brings the sodium count to 1,000 milligrams, as well as sausage or bacon, which boosts sodium and saturated fat. Whatever you do, skip over the ultimate breakfast platter, which appears more appropriate for a group, as it comes with scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage, a biscuit and three pancakes. It has over a full day's worth of sodium. We also recommend avoiding the Egg-normous burrito, which has a whole day's worth of sodium and saturated fat."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":720,"title":" Outsmart the food companies to become a healthier, savvier eater","class":1,"body":" (CNN)Like many people, I crave something sweet after every meal, no matter how full I am, to the point where it feels like an addiction. A colleague told me it wasn't an addiction, but a habit. Still, the thought lingered: Do we experience true food cravings, perhaps as a result of an addiction, or is it simply out of habit? And who's driving that habit -- me or the food companies? It's actually both: It's human nature for consumers to develop habits and seek out foods that satisfy our intense cravings. And so companies create products that meet people's sensory needs. Food companies are interested in selling products that people want, said Gail Civille, founder and president of Sensory Spectrum, a consulting firm that helps companies learn how sensory cues drive consumer perceptions of products. They run tests with consumers and ask them, 'How much do you like this one? Or that one?' The companies are trying to figure out what consumers want, and then they do testing to make sure the product has those elements in it -- and people like salt, fat and sugar. It's no surprise that food companies would aim to give consumers what they want in an effort to optimize sales. But the process behind product development is quite sophisticated. For companies, the key is finding a food's bliss point. Discovering the 'bliss point' The key for companies is finding the bliss point of a food, or the product formulation you like most, according to Howard Moskowitz, an experimental psychologist who did pioneering work on bliss points and their role in product development when he was optimizing menus for soldiers in 1971. He's since helped major food and beverage companies such as Dr Pepper and Prego find bliss points for their products. Starbucks&#39; menu, as selected by a nutritionist He offered this example: Let's just look at coffee with milk. Make some coffee, and pour it into seven cups. Start with no milk, and add a certain amount, such as you'd find in the tiny plastic containers at a diner. Do this so you have zero, one, two, three, four, five and six added containers. The one at the left has no milk; the ones to the right have six different but increasing levels of milk. One of these is the 'tastiest' for you. This is your bliss point. How does bliss point play out behind the scenes, when it comes to product design and development? For new products, like pickles or pasta sauce, the company may systematically vary the ingredients and test these variations. It's not just one ingredient alone, but a set of them. Some ingredients appear at different levels. Others appear in different types (such as flavoring A or flavoring B). The careful product developer makes the combinations, tests them and builds a mathematical model showing how the ingredients interact to drive liking, Moskowitz said. The bliss point -- that's at the top. Sometimes, there are different bliss points, or 'optima,' say for people who like strong 'dark roast (coffee) brews' and those who like the regular or weaker 'lighter brews.'  Bliss points have been discovered for many foods -- even hummus and orange juice -- in order to appeal to consumers' sensory preferences. And this can help explain why, over time, foods evolve to have more sweetness. The mindful way to distract you from your cravings Each generation of food marketers wants to increase acceptance, and the easiest way to do this for many foods is to add sugar, Moskowitz said. But it's a slippery slope. You add just a little bit each time, so over the course of a decade, there's a bigger change. Thus, foods like condiments, tomato sauce and bread -- foods that we might not necessarily think of as sweet -- often contain added sugars. Tomato sauce can have 12 grams, about 3 teaspoons, of sugar per half-cup. That's more than you would find in a chocolate mini doughnut. Barbecue sauce can have 16 grams of sugar -- or 4 teaspoons in a 2-tablespoon serving -- more sugar than the amount in four chocolate chip cookies or eight sugar wafers. It's no wonder our palates have evolved to the point where we don't necessarily know what natural sweetness is anymore: Our taste buds have been, to some degree, externally manipulated over the years. Heading off food burnout Although bliss point may be used to find how much pulp an orange juice should contain or the optimal amount of fat for the tastiest ice cream, it has other applications, too. Bliss point has also been used to figure out at which point during a consumption period a person is most sated. But the two applications don't necessarily work together, because the same sensory characteristics that make your taste buds most excited can run the risk of burnout with each additional bite. The concept, known as sensory specific satiety, refers to a temporary decline in pleasure derived from consuming a certain food. The result, according to a study in the journal Appetite, is a decrease in a person's liking and desire for a specific food after eating it. Your coffee habit may be genetic The more powerful your experience with the first couple of bites, the less satisfying each additional bite is, said Brian Wansink, director of Cornell University's Food and Brand Lab and author of Slim by Design. The result: You get bored of eating relatively quickly. When you eat salted caramel ice cream, the first two bites are incredible. But then there's a big jump by the time you get to bites six and seven. ... By then, you may be saying, 'Eh, this wasn't as good as it was initially.'  Interestingly, sensory specific satiety can be thought of as a human protection element -- and a way the body adapts in order to avoid sensory overload, according to Civille, of Sensory Spectrum. Imagine stepping slowly and carefully into a very hot bathtub. At first, you feel HOT, HOT, HOT! But then your body adapts to the hot temperature in order to protect itself from having too much stimulation, as the brain cannot process all of the messages at once, Civille said. In the case of food, adaptation results in fullness. Despite this scientific reality, the notion of sensory specific satiety doesn't stop companies from prioritizing taste experience, with the hope that you won't be able to stop after just one bite. Companies are developing products for that initial 'Oh, my goodness!' with the first couple of bites, Wansink said. And even if the level of sensory satisfaction drops, if you start high enough, it won't necessarily matter. The seventh and eighth bite of the salted caramel ice cream will still be pretty good, he said. You're still far ahead of the grapefruit. How the sugar industry sweetened research in its favor In order to extend the amount of time it will take before you get bored of eating a food, its maker may include ingredient variety -- for example, making a raisin bran with yogurt puffs or oatmeal clusters. Wansink explains how: If you mix popcorn with M&Ms, you can eat a lot more than you would if you ate either food alone, because the M&Ms counter the salty flavor of the popcorn, and the buttery popcorn counters the sweetness of the M&Ms. Civille agrees. Without texture and flavor variety, you become full or burnt out. Any new input is not interesting. This phenomenon helps explain why kids -- and adults -- can say I'm so full after a meal but still have room for dessert. Dessert is sweet and interesting. No wonder I need my sugar fix, even when I'm stuffed from a larger-than-usual meal. Perhaps I'm not truly addicted to sugar, but rather, my body has succumbed to the science of sensory specific satiety. Becoming an empowered eater The psychology that goes into finding a bliss point and coping with sensory specific satiety is significantly helpful for companies' bottom lines, but the practical takeaway can have implications for consumers' health, particularly when foods and beverages are consumed in excess. Changing kids' palates -- which already prefer sweet tastes -- toward sweetness can lead to weight gain, obesity and other health problems. In a world of such abundance, how can consumers become more educated and make the right choices? Here are some tips and tricks to help become savvier, healthier eaters: Distracted by doughnuts: How your brain works against your best intentions1. Find a food mantra. What if we could find the messages to repeat to ourselves, almost like self-advertising, to get us to eat healthily? asked Moskowitz. In fact, that's what the bliss point pioneer is working on now: messages that work for consumers. The science is of words, but it's still looking for the bliss point. But now the bliss point is the combination of messages that a person will find compelling. You might ask yourself, Am I really hungry? Do I really want this food? Or am I bored or stressed? External motivation works too, he says. Many people will remind themselves of goals, like, 'I want to look good in a dress for my daughter's wedding.'  2. Have a decent breakfast. It will help you avoid cravings, especially sugar cravings. If your blood sugar is low (from skipping breakfast), you're going to start eating anything and everything, Civille said. But a bagel with nothing on it? You'll be hungry again by 10:30. The key is to manipulate your own body's cravings by giving it the right kinds of foods to start with, she said. And different foods may work better for different people. If I eat a bowl of oatmeal at 6:30, I'm not hungry until lunch. 3. Wean your palate. You can change your palate to crave less sweet, salty, fatty foods. Once people learn to like skim milk, whole milk is too much for them, Wansink said. One of the ways you can make it happen, he says, is to make sure you pair the product that contains less sugar, salt, fat, whatever -- with something that you do like. Let's say you drink way too much Coke. You tell yourself you're going to drink Diet Coke instead, but you hate the taste of diet soda. So you pair it with something you do enjoy, like taking a walk. By doing this, he says, you don't experience the switch to diet soda as such a sacrifice, and eventually you will like it more. Or try making the switch from a sugary cereal to a more protein-rich breakfast. Something as simple as pairing cheese or ketchup with eggs can make a protein-rich breakfast more appealing, and eventually, you won't even crave the sugar. How to end your sugar addiction 4. Add fat. You should have some fat in your diet, because fat is interesting and satiating. It holds flavor and releases the flavor in a different way than a water-based system, Civille said. Consider the difference between a teaspoon of vanilla extract in heavy cream (that's so good!) versus skim milk (awful). The satiety and satisfaction that the fat offers will ultimately allow you to eat less. Spread peanut butter on apple slices or top a mixed green salad with a vinaigrette dressing. 5. Choose portion-controlled snacks. Here's a case where package design (think 100-calorie packs) may be more costly, but they help you eat less, because they slow the pace of eating. Having to open up three 100-calorie packs to get 300 calories of chocolate takes a longer time to eat and makes you less sated than if all 300 chocolate calories were in front of you, Wansink said. The result: People usually give up -- and consume fewer calories overall. To save money, buy snacks in bulk and make your own portion-controlled snacks at home using small plastic bags. 6. Drink a glass of water. Having a glass of water with you all the time is one way of dealing with sensory specific satiety, Civille said. The sense of fullness reduces hunger and keeps us hydrated. Often, we eat when we, in fact, are thirsty or dehydrated. 7. Choose cheese over chips at a party. People immediately go to the bowl of chips, but you should be looking for the more protein-rich appetizer, which will give you more satiety, Civille said. A cube of cheese, shrimp or even a slider is a good choice. 8. Don't go food shopping on an empty stomach. When you go to the supermarket hungry, you buy things that you crave ... and those are typically not good choices, like ice cream, doughnuts and cookies, as opposed to buying more vegetables, Civille said. Wasnick agrees. You buy more of the ready-to-eat convenience food, the stuff you can eat in the parking lot, he said. Here's food for thought: Simply eating a piece of fruit 30 minutes before going into a grocery store can significantly change your purchasing habits for the better. Even just a piece of an apple before you leave -- or even a sample of one -- dramatically increases how much fruit you buy and decreases the amount of junk food, Wansink said. 9. Divide your cart in half. An easy thing that we've discovered is the half-cart rule, Wansink said. Divide your cart in half with a coat, purse or briefcase. The front half of the cart is reserved for fruits and vegetables. The back half of the cart is for whatever else I want. Simply doing this increases the amount of fruit and vegetables people buy by 25%-30%. 10. Distract yourself. There's a really neat study we did: We had people only eat a quarter as much of a snack as they usually eat in the afternoon, Wansink said. So let's say you usually eat eight Hershey's Kisses, and we gave you two. We found that 15 minutes later, people rated themselves as equally full, satisfied and happy -- and less guilty! But here's the important part: After they had their first two bites, they had to put the food away -- they couldn't stare at it -- and they had to do something (active) for those 15 minutes to distract themselves, like cleaning the office or returning phone calls. They could not sit at the computer. The results were encouraging. All they could remember is that they still tasted that chocolate, apple pie or potato chips -- and they realized they didn't deny themselves anything. But getting their minds off of the food was key. They realized they can have what they enjoy -- as long as they can distract themselves enough to not think about it."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":721,"title":" 1 in 4 US children lacks proper health care, report says","class":1,"body":" Dr. Irwin Redlener, who co-authored the report, sat down with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday morning to reveal the details. He said he hopes it will convince Donald Trump and members of his administration to not repeal and replace Obamacare, as the President-elect has pledged to do. We still have about 20 million children in America, even with insurance, who are not getting the kind of health care that they need, said Redlener, who is president of the Children's Health Fund and a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University. That's really a big problem. It would have been for any administration, but we're concerned now because there's some threat that if we do eliminate the Affordable Care Act, we'll put millions of children at risk. The report finds that 3.3 million children in the United States are uninsured but says they are not the only ones facing barriers to health care. Many children are insured but live in places where they can't get to doctors. There are children who live in extreme shortage areas, Redlener said. They live in counties or communities where there's less than one doctor for every 3,000 people. They're living in communities where there is no affordable transportation to allow parents to take the kids to the doctor even if they want to. Redlener, who supported Hillary Clinton in this month's presidential election and was going to be part of her transition team, said the focus needs to be on getting doctors to underserved areas and fixing the transportation system, rather than on changing the insurance system. He told Cuomo that he is reaching out to Trump's administration and thinks it will be receptive. There's been a lot of talk about fixing our infrastructure, he said. Well, in some ways, children are human infrastructure. We need investments in children, at least as much as we need investment in our physical attributes. Watch New Day weekdays at 6am-9am ET.

{"id":722,"title":" Deaf-blind twins share special relationship","class":1,"body":"(CNN)Deutsches Taubblindenwerk Fischbeck is a quiet place, a German facility where more than 100 deaf-blind people live together. Before photographer Marlena Waldthausen even lifted her camera there, she spent a few days observing the residents, trying to find a way to tell their stories without knowing how to talk to them. Deaf-blindness can be isolating. For many people in Fischbeck, communication is difficult. Most of the deaf-blind people there have little or no 'real' relationships, Waldthausen said, and she was afraid that she couldn't say what she wanted to tell them. Spending time with residents, she wondered, what would be left of her own life is she could neither see nor hear? But on the second day of her visit, she crossed paths with a set of twin brothers. Rolf was guiding Jörg, she remembers, and they were laughing and joking. I just really liked them from the first moment I saw them, said Waldthausen, who is based in Berlin. What I found so special about them was their almost symbiotic relationship, this 'blind' understanding. Jörg and Rolf Fischer were born deaf, and Jörg lost his eyesight due to diabetes. Rolf, who also has diabetes, can still see a little out of one eye. At 49, they live together in Fischbeck and travel home on weekends to spend time with their parents. They love their routine, Waldthausen said, and handle many parts of their lives independently -- dressing, making their beds and having meals on their own. Caretakers accompany them to activities like swimming or horseback riding. In the afternoons and evenings, they might drink coffee, play with dogs, rest or watch TV -- Rolf will get close so he can watch, then report back to Jörg. They communicate through tactile sign language; they take each other's hands and form signs with the hands and arms of the other. Although they struggle with sensation in their hands because of diabetes, they also use the Lorm alphabet, where every letter corresponds with a point on the palm. A series of strokes and taps can share a thought. Their sign language is their own, though. Even their caretakers can't follow conversations between them, Waldthausen said. They might make loving gestures, or seem to hit each other, or pull their arms and fingers. And they are funny -- amazing humor, Waldthausen said. They give each other funny hairstyles, push each other around in a wheelchair or pretend to bite each other. I think they might forget a little about their situation when they are fooling around, Waldthausen said. Waldthausen struggled at first, feeling insecure about how to communicate with them. I couldn't smile, gesture or apologize in the way I am used to when I have to communicate with people that speak a language I don't understand, she said. So Waldthausen learned the Lorm alphabet and started a course in sign language. She spent months with the twins in 2015 and 2016, staying in rooms nearby and going on vacation with the family. Now, she can joke with them or talk about their trip to the zoo, or the sausages they ate for dinner. In one of her favorite moments, the twins attended a photojournalism exhibition that featured Waldthausen's images. She and their mother explained each one. They were so proud when people came and shook their hands, she said. That was a really nice moment for me after spending so many months with them, being able to make them experience the outcome of the project. People tell her the images moved them, she said, or made them feel warmly toward the twins just by seeing them together. She knows the feeling. It makes me happy (that) I could show something through the pictures that I myself experienced being with them, she said, and that I could make something visible that is usually not so visible.

{"id":723,"title":" Cancer immunotherapy trial stopped again after 2 more deaths","class":1,"body":" (CNN)After more patient deaths, Juno Therapeutics announced Wednesday that it is voluntarily putting its ROCKET trial on hold for the second time this year. The patients enrolled in this Phase II trial are adults with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, according to the biopharmaceutical company's website. We took this action after two additional patients in this trial experienced cerebral edema earlier this week, Juno CEO Hans Bishop said on a conference call this morning. One patient died Tuesday, and another died earlier Wednesday. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a type of blood cancer that can spread quickly through the body and, if left untreated, can be fatal within months. Cerebral edema is brain swelling caused by excess fluid inside the skull. Want to become a human guinea pig? Here&#39;s what you need to know In July, the trial was put on a clinical hold at the direction of the Food and Drug Administration. At that time, the company revealed three patient deaths, also the result of cerebral edema. According to Bishop, investigators pinpointed the likely culprit as the addition of fludarabine to the pre-conditioning regimen. Fludarabine is a chemotherapy drug used here as a one-time primer for treatment, used in an effort to increase the effectiveness of the experimental therapy. In this particular course of treatment, pre-conditioning consists of a heavy dose of chemotherapy to kill off existing cancer cells in order to give the new cancer-killing T-cells room to grow. It's like hitting a reset button to restart the immune system. But an unforeseen interaction between fludarabine and genetically modified JCAR015 cells proved to be lethal. After petitioning the FDA, Juno was permitted to continue the trial without the use of fludarabine. In August, the trial resumed, and 12 patients have been treated since, said Juno Chief Medical Officer Mark Gilbert on Wednesday. This includes the two patients who died this week after being treated last week. The FDA monitors all US drug trials and says fatal adverse events are extremely rare. Can your own immune system kill cancer?  Immunotherapy has been heralded as the new frontier in the war on cancer. It works by harnessing the body's immune system to fight cancer from within. But many of these cutting-edge treatments are still in the experimentation phase. A Phase II clinical trial is designed to test the effectiveness of a new drug or treatment. It typically follows a Phase I trial, which evaluates safety and side effects. Before a new drug or treatment goes to market, it must also pass through a Phase III trial, as outlined by the National Institutes of Health. Going forward, all options remain on the table for JCAR015, Bishop said Wednesday. The options include, among others: moving forward with JCAR015 in the current study under a modified protocol, beginning a new study or terminating the program. Juno's other ongoing trials, including JCAR017 cells, are not affected, according to the company. Any decision on how to move forward will of course need to be made, taking into account feedback from the FDA and our (Data and Safety Monitoring Board), as well as the treating physicians in the trial, Bishop said. He added that the patients in this trial often have no other options. Bishop said the company plans to provide a more thorough update in the next few weeks."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":724,"title":" Vitamin D doesn't prevent disease for most, study says","class":1,"body":"During the bleak winter months of short days and cloudy skies, many people may seek out the benefits of sunshine in bottle form and reach for supplements of vitamin D. Made naturally by the skin when exposed to sunlight, this vitamin is needed to maintain healthy bones, teeth and muscles and to prevent them from becoming brittle and at risk of fracture. But a review of evidence from clinical trials on the impact of supplements has found that attempting to get vitamin D through supplements is not so beneficial. We conclude that current evidence does not support the use of vitamin D supplementation to prevent disease, said Mark Bolland, associate professor of medicine at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in a statement. Bolland led the research with Alison Avenell, a clinical chair in health sciences research at the University of Aberdeen. According to the team, clinical trials have failed to show that supplementation reduces the risk posed by falls and fractures to bones and muscles. But they recognize that it may be beneficial in people who are at high risk, such as those in nursing homes and darker-skinned people living in colder climates.To those at risk, researchers do recommend supplements during autumn and winter but also suggest getting advice on how best to get vitamin D naturally. Vitamin D will protect people who are at high risk, Avenell said. Natural sources In spring and summer in the far regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, such as the northern US and New Zealand, people tend to produce enough vitamin D through sunlight on their skin and foods in their diet. The vitamin helps the body absorb calcium to promote bone growth. Getting enough vitamin D, calculated as 15 micrograms for ages 1 through 70 in the United States, also prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia -- bone softening -- in adults. We're taking about preventing these diseases, said Avenell.Americans take fewer multivitamins but more vitamin D, omega-3s But during autumn and winter, levels drop. It helps to eat the right foods, such as oily fish, egg yolks, red meat and liver, to keep levels high inside the body -- which not everyone can achieve adequately. Fortified foods, including milk, cereals and spreads, provide the most vitamin D in the American diet, according to the National Institutes of Health. In the US, vitamin D supplementation (through food) is higher, Avenell said. In countries like the UK, however, foods are not fortified as often, and supplements are therefore recommended. Until recently, recommendations were mainly to people at high risk of rickets and osteomalacia, but this summer, Public Health England advised that everyone take the equivalent of 10 micrograms per day.That's a big change, Avenell said. We don't think the evidence supports the necessity for that during winter. In a separate article, also published Wednesday, Dr. Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, argued that the recommended dose is backed by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which also reviewed the evidence. When the days are darker and shorter and sun exposure is minimal, people should consider a daily 10 microgram vitamin D supplement, as it's difficult to get enough through diet alone, he said in a statement. But Avenell's research argues that the supplements make no difference. They're unlikely to do any harm, she said. But in the adult population, supplementing at the Public Health England levels does not prevent falls or fractures. Research was also inconclusive on other benefits claimed to be associated with vitamin D. We didn't see any conclusive evidence of vitamin D protecting against other conditions like heart disease or cancer (either), she said. The pros and cons of vitamin D have long been debated, but with this review questioning their benefit -- except among those at high risk -- many experts have pushed back in fear of the consequences if people stop taking them. From the plague to polio ... 10 diseases you (wrongly) thought were gone Failure to address low vitamin D status during childhood, adolescence, for women of childbearing age and in the elderly could have serious long-term implications for public health, said David Richardson, visiting professor of food bioscience at the University of Reading. Action is needed now in the face of growing evidence of a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency. Martin Hewison, professor of molecular endocrinology at the University of Birmingham, agreed. It is clear that people in the UK are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, particularly in winter, he said, though he highlighted Avenell's point that supplements are particularly relevant for people at high risk of deficiency: those with darker skin from African, Afro-Caribbean and South Asian backgrounds; people who are confined indoors; and people who cover up their skin while outdoors. Hewison also highlighted various levels of confusion and unknowns that persist around the issue. There is still some debate about what levels of vitamin D count as deficiency, and this varies according to the disease being studied, he said. (But) the take-home message is that we need to know more about how vitamin D works before planning new clinical trials to assess its health benefits. In the meantime, Public Health England's vitamin D recommendations are conservative and sensible, and people should be following them."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":725,"title":" Thunderstorm asthma:' Deadly illness caused by freak weather","class":1,"body":" (CNN)An unusual combination of weather conditions leading to a freak illness known as thunderstorm asthma has left four people dead in Australia. Thousands of people were rushed to hospital Monday with breathing problems in the southern Australian state of Victoria as emergency services struggled to cope.Three were still in a critical condition Thursday, a Victorian Department of Health spokesman told CNN. During a four hour period Monday, Ambulance Victoria received more than 1,900 calls, or one call every four to five seconds. An extra 60 ambulances were deployed, as well as police and firefighters. Thunderstorm asthma occurs when a storm hits during a period of unusually high rye grass pollen, said Robin Ould, chief executive of the Asthma Foundation of Australia. When you have a perfect storm coming together (of) a very high pollen day, high humidity, and a thunderstorm, the grains of rye grass absorb water with the humidity and they break up into thousands of pieces, Ould said. Normally with rye grass the pollen would be trapped by nose hairs. When it breaks up it goes straight to the lungs. The pollen irritates the lungs' bronchial tubes, causing them to become inflamed and filled with mucus and making it hard for people to breathe. Pollen levels peak in late spring. When this combines with strong winds, rain and high temperatures, as it did in Victoria this week, it can lead to incidents of thunderstorm asthma. Though grass pollen is the most common known cause of thunderstorm asthma, attacks can also be triggered by excessive levels of tree pollen and fungal spores in the atmosphere. This will vary by geography, said Aziz Sheikh, Professor of Primary Care Research and Development at the University of Edinburgh, adding that pollen from olive trees, for example, was reported in a previous thunderstorm asthma event in Italy in 2010. Levels of fungal spores in the atmosphere typically peak during harvest, which can also be drawn up and broken down during large thunderstorms due to the rise in atmospheric pressure, according to Sheikh. Edward Newbigin, a professor of biosciences at the University of Melbourne, said that many of those affected in Australia this week may never have had an asthma attack before. I imagine it was absolutely terrifying, he said. Of more than 2,500 people surveyed by the university, 74% said they experienced asthma during the storm. Of those, 32% had never experienced an asthma attack before. One of the dead, 18-year-old Omar Moujalled, had just finished his final year of studies at Melbourne's Australian International Academy. 18-year-old Omar Moujalled was one of the victims of a &quot;thunderstorm asthma&quot; incident in Victoria, Australia on November 21, 2016. 18-year-old Omar Moujalled was one of the victims of a thunderstorm asthma incident in Victoria, Australia on November 21, 2016. His friend Shuayb Talic told CNN the news left him in absolute shock, denial, then horror. Omar was the fittest of the group, Talic said. We were discussing a gym meet up just a few days earlier. However, he did have asthma, and apparently it was so severe during the storm he could barely stand up to treat it. Apollo Papadopoulos, 35, and Hope Carnevali, 20, also died during the storm. Carnevali passed away in the arms of her family members after waiting more than 40 minutes for an ambulance, according to CNN affiliate 7 News Australia. The fourth victim was father-of-two Clarence Leo, 7 News Australia said, who died after an asthma attack early on Tuesday morning. Apollo Papadopoulos and Hope Carnevali died of breathing complications due to &quot;thunderstorm asthma.&quot;  Apollo Papadopoulos and Hope Carnevali died of breathing complications due to thunderstorm asthma. Thunderstorm asthma last struck Victoria in May 2010, having previously had several reports, according to Sheikh. But the condition is not limited to Australia. Experts say incidents of thunderstorm asthma have been seen in the UK, US, Italy and Canada, but the condition is very under reported, said Newbigin. Sheikh pointed out, however, that English-speaking countries are also countries with the highest prevalence of asthma. People with hay fever are particularly at risk, Newbigin said. He advised them to better manage your hay fever during the pollen season, by using antihistamines, eye drops and other medications. Though normally hay fever occurs in the nasal area, the freak weather conditions which cause thunderstorm asthma can drive the allergens deep into the lungs, causing a far more severe asthmatic attack. Anybody with severe or brittle asthma (a less common form involving severe but irregular attacks) is most likely to experience severe symptoms and need rapid treatment, said Sheikh, adding that smog days, pollution and smoking as other environmental triggers for an attack. They are much less likely to trigger it if there is good underlying asthma control."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":726,"title":" Woman with severe eating disorder wins right to refuse forced feedings","class":1,"body":"(CNN)A woman battling a severe eating disorder won the right to refuse forced feedings in a New Jersey court on Monday, according to her attorney. Judge Paul Armstrong announced that the court recognized her right to live free from medical intervention in an opinion delivered in Morris County Superior Court, according to attorney Edward d'Alessandro. Anorexic woman makes dramatic transformation The order came after state agencies moved to force the 29-year-old woman, referred to in court documents as A.G., to use a feeding tube, which would deliver liquid nutrition through her nose directly into her stomach, as part of her care. The legal battle was set in motion when her court-appointed guardian sought an order allowing her to enter palliative care, since feeding methods put in place over the summer led to heart failure, which she has now recovered from. The woman had recently ripped out her PICC line and had repeatedly refused further treatment, according to court documents. A PICC line is essentially an IV tube used to administer treatments such as chemotherapy or, as in this case, saline nutrition. The state's Department of Human Services and its Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services opposed the motion. Armstrong's ruling now means the woman can enter palliative care, where the goal is to relieve the symptoms of her illness and improve her quality of life, which was her wish. However, the state argued in a legal brief that This is in essence, permitting A.G. to die. The Department of Human Services referred questions to the state attorney general's office, which did not respond to a request for comment. When your daughter has anorexia The woman has had anorexic thoughts since the age of 5, according to court documents. With incidents dating as far back as her high school years, she has repeatedly refused to cooperate with treatment and has been hospitalized multiple times for her disorder. The disorder, involving both eating restriction and bingeing and purging, left her weighing only 60 pounds when she was admitted to the hospital this summer. The state argues that the woman is delusional, claiming that she suffers from a mental disorder that, among other things, includes a distorted view of reality, and a false view of her own weight and prognosis. In another area of its brief, the state writes as an example of her thinking that she believes any weight above 65 to 67 pounds is obese. Additionally, her guardian testified that the woman did not want a feeding tube because she did not want to get fat, according to court documents. According to d'Alessandro, the woman will still receive medication, counseling and pastoral support through her palliative care. My client is very grateful that the court recognized her right to self-determination and is allowing her to live free from intervention, d'Alessandro said."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":727,"title":"Prescription drug reactions send more older Americans to the ER","class":1,"body":"(CNN)We are a nation of prescription drug users. In any given month, half the population -- an estimated 48% -- take at least one pharmaceutical medicine. One possible downside to what are often helpful medications is made clear in a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. One out of every 250 Americans visited the emergency room because of a drug reaction each year in 2013 and 2014, researchers estimated. This is an increase from 2005 and 2006, the last time drug reactions were studied. Estimates for children, teens and young adults remained the same. However, elderly Americans ended up in the ER at a higher rate during 2013 and 2014 than in the past, even when taking into account different population numbers during the two periods. About 35% of ER visits due to drug reactions occurred among adults 65 or older between 2013 and 2014, compared with just 26% during 2005 and 2006, the CDC estimates. Anticoagulants (blood-thinners for preventing blood clots), antibiotics (for infections), diabetes medicines, opioids (pain medications) and antipsychotics are the most common culprits, according to Nadine Shehab, a senior scientist in the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, and her co-authors. Life in recovery after prescription addiction The finding that the same drugs identified a decade ago continue to be common causes of emergency department visits for adverse drug events indicates that safety interventions should be focused on these drugs, Dr. Daniel Budnitz, the senior author of the paper and director of the CDC's Medication Safety Program, wrote in an email. Hemorrhages and severe allergic reactions The researchers looked into the reasons for emergency room visits in the United States during the 2013-14 period. Specifically, the team focused on drug reactions, including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements and vaccines. After analyzing data from 58 emergency rooms, they estimated how frequently the problem occurred on a national level and then compared that data to their estimates for the 2005-06 period. Based on 42,585 cases, the team estimates that four out of every 1,000 people in the United States went to emergency rooms each year because of a drug reaction during the 2013-14 period. More than a quarter (27%) of these patients had to be hospitalized. Should you tough out pain or take painkillers? Overall, the estimates indicate that blood thinners, antibiotics and diabetes drugs led to just less than half of the total ER visits. Among young children (5 or younger), antibiotics were the most common drug class leading to an ER visit: 56% of the total. Among older children and teens, antibiotics were the most common cause of an ER visit (32% of the total), followed by antipsychotics (nearly 5%). Slightly more than a third of all ER visits for drug interactions were by the elderly during the study period -- a nearly 10% increase since the last study. Older adults also experienced the highest hospitalization rates. Patients experienced hemorrhages (from anticoagulants), severe allergic reactions (from antibiotics) and hypoglycemia with neurological effects (from diabetes drugs). Budnitz explained that past studies have found about 30% of outpatient antibiotics are prescribed unnecessarily. The way to minimize the risk of a severe allergic reaction is simply to not prescribe antibiotics unless they are really needed. Gupta: Let&#39;s end the prescription drug death epidemic By comparison, diabetes drugs and blood thinners are lifesaving drugs for those who require them. The risk with these drugs is incorrect dosing, so doctors need to carefully oversee and manage patients taking these drugs. This is not a surprise, as overall medication usage has increased on a per-patient basis and the population is aging, wrote Timothy P. Ryan, founder of Sano Informed Prescribing, a health care technology company. Ryan said the data in the new study are a microcosm of a much larger medication issue. Patients are often cared for by multiple physicians, each having an incomplete view of the patient's drug use, he said. The authors of an editorial accompanying the article agree. Dangerous interactions In this fragmented health care system, clinicians often hesitate to discontinue medications because of lack of familiarity with the medication or patient, wrote Drs. Chad Kessler, Michael J. Ward and Candace D. McNaughton. They add that even when doctors are familiar with patients, it is difficult to coordinate medications for multiple conditions (for example, one patient has both heart problems and chronic kidney disease). Kessler, of Durham VA Medical Center in North Carolina, and Ward and McNaughton, both of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee, were not affiliated with the original research. In a study published last year in PLOS One, Ryan and his co-authors found an increasing number of patients who were prescribed multiple medications simultaneously. Additionally, they found that some patients were taking medications without their doctors' knowledge, and among these patients, some were combining drugs that are dangerous when used together. Why do Americans need to be aware of this issue? It's a largely unrecognized health issue, Ryan said. Americans are increasingly overmedicated. He added that fixing the system will require changes in both the health care system and its patients."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":728,"title":"The 'surprising' way food ads sway preschoolers' snacking habits","class":1,"body":"(CNN)Snack commercials that kids see on television may be more persuasive than you might think. The food advertisements that children as young as preschool age view while watching their favorite shows can sway them to overeat even when they're not hungry, a new study suggests. The small study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday, is the first of its kind to weigh the effect that food advertisements have on preschoolers' snacking habits, said Jennifer Emond, lead author of the study and an assistant professor in the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College. Until now, most studies have examined that effect among school-age or older children. Yet highly palatable, unhealthy foods are heavily advertised to kids as young as 2 -- primarily on TV, Emond said. Overall, our research suggests that exposure to food ads can prime eating behaviors in young children that tells children to respond to external signals instead of listening to their own internal signals of fullness and hunger, she said. That learned response may set children up for developing poor eating habits that contribute to obesity. Snacking habits hacked The study involved 60 children, ages 2 to 5 years old, who were shown a 14-minute segment of Elmo's World from the show Sesame Street. Half of the children watched the segment embedded with a mix of food advertisements, while others watched the segment embedded with a mix of department store ads. Kids and Obesity Before viewing, all of the children were provided with snacks to eat and were surveyed on how hungry they felt. Then, while viewing the segment, the children were provided with two snacks: corn snacks and graham snacks. The same corn snacks provided were featured in the food advertisements shown to some of the children. The researchers found that the preschoolers who watched the segment embedded with food ads consumed more calories in snacks on average than those who watched the department store ads. Additionally, the children who watched the food ads ended up eating more of the advertised corn snack than the graham snack -- even if they had never eaten the corn snack before and, therefore, were not familiar with it. That was surprising because it demonstrated the powerful effect food advertising can have on priming potentially unhealthy eating behaviors at a young age, Emond said. Musicians popular with teens endorse mostly junk food, study finds Emond added that similar findings have been demonstrated among older children in separate studies. The researchers believe that this latest finding among preschoolers could be replicated in a larger sample size. Given the consistency in the findings across different studies and now among different age groups, we do think we are measuring a true effect, Emond said. Food ads on the brain Why might food advertisements have this effect on preschoolers? More research is needed to find a clear answer. However, it might have something to do with a reward system in the brain called the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, according to a study published last month in the International Journal of Obesity. Kids seeing more unhealthy snack ads, report says In that study, which involved about 200 children ages 9 to 10 years old, the researchers wrote that tasty snacks are known to activate that reward system in the brain. Further research is needed to explore whether seeing food cues in advertisements unconsciously signals children to eat in order to feel that rewarding sensation, Emond said. Importantly, we also know from our previous research that some children may have a genetic predisposition to respond to food ads. About 40% of all food and beverage ads that children and teens see on television are for unhealthy snacks, according to a 2015 report by the University of Connecticut's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity (PDF). Moms manipulated into buying their kids unhealthy food, study says Parents should not shrug off food marketing. These ads really do influence children, said Marlene Schwartz, director for the center and a professor of human development and family studies at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study. If the ads were for healthy foods, that would be an asset to parents, but when the ads are for unhealthy foods, they make parents' job harder, she said. Marketing may help kids eat healthier Indeed, food ads can be successful in encouraging healthy snacking, too. It turns out that marketing healthy foods in the same way as unhealthy snacks can nearly triple the likelihood of a child munching on fruits and vegetables, according to a study published in the journal Pediatrics this year. The superpowered secret to get kids to eat veggies There is no doubt that advertising affects children. But we should also recognize that everyone -- children, adolescents and adults -- are exposed to media of all sorts on a daily basis, said Andrew Hanks, assistant professor of human sciences at Ohio State University and lead author of that marketing study. The more parents know about the impacts of advertising on children, the more they can help their children prepare to process the messages in an appropriate manner, he said. If parents are going to make food readily available for their children, choose the lower-calorie snacks, such as cut-up apples or carrot sticks. Many children's television programs are now offered ad-free through various services, said David Just, a professor at Cornell University who was a co-author of the same marketing study as Hanks. We think it is very important for parents to understand the impact that advertising of any kind has on their children, he said. Also, it is important for parents to be aware of what their children are watching and the types of ads their kids are viewing. And not only to be aware but to talk to them about what they see."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":729,"title":"New amputation procedure offers promise","class":1,"body":" (CNN)The world has watched in wonder as technologists unveil bionic arms and robotic legs. But just as these prosthetic advances offer hope to those who've lost limbs, the surgical side of amputations has largely stayed the same, a pioneering doctor said Monday.A first-of-its-kind amputation procedure, conducted in July, was shared during a news conference at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital in Boston. Dynamic-model amputation may allow the brain to interact with and power a prosthetic -- and sense where a limb is without the patient having to look. With a preserved relationship between muscles in concert with prosthetic innovations, Dr. Matthew Carty explained, patients may enjoy restored limb function in new and more natural ways. The idea of what could be possible was a welcome one for Jim Ewing, 52, who underwent the experimental procedure. An engineer by training, he liked the idea of being part of something visionary. About two years ago, Ewing, of Maine, fell 50 feet while rock climbing in the Cayman Islands. He landed on his left side and received multiple injuries, including a shattered ankle. No matter the excruciating work he did in physical therapy, severe nerve damage blocked meaningful progress. He could not walk barefoot. Stepping on a simple grain of sand would fire off sharp and stabbing pain. In shoes, he couldn't travel 100 feet without stopping in exhaustion and agony. He plowed through medical journals and researched clinical trials, but nothing suggested that his ankle could be saved. He couldn't bear to live with this sort of pain. A longtime climber, he reached out to Hugh Herr, a man he'd met 30 years before. Jim Ewing takes his first steps after his amputation. Jim Ewing takes his first steps after his amputation. Herr, himself a climber whose legs were amputated below the knees after he was rescued from a 1982 winter climb, had become head of biomechatronics research at the MIT Media Lab. Biomechatronics is a field that combines human physiology with electromechanics in developing bionic limbs. Ewing told Herr he wanted to know what life would look like if he decided to amputate his foot. Ewing said Herr told him of those who'd struggled for years, only to have their limbs amputated in the end. He also told him how surgeons had generally viewed amputation as a failure. Finally, Ewing said, he told me about the research he and Dr. Carty were doing. ... I was intrigued. Soon after meeting with Carty, director of the lower extremity transplant program at Brigham and Women's Hospital, he was sold. It's now been four months since I had my foot removed. It's been challenging. I won't lie, Ewing said. Nonetheless, he's 100% certain I made the right decision. 'The Ewing Amputation' A standard amputation cuts feedback between muscles, Carty said. But by creating a tendon pulley system through the Ewing Amputation -- as this new procedure will be called -- muscles can work in relation to one another, and patients can maintain a better connection to the nervous system and to the feeling of limb control. Carty has been collaborating with other plastic, vascular and orthopedic surgeons as well as Herr's team at the MIT Media Lab. His work was bolstered in 2014, when he was awarded the first Stepping Strong Innovator Award, established by the The Gillian Reny Stepping Strong Center for Trauma Innovation to fund projects in innovative trauma treatment and recovery. (Reny was 18 when her legs were critically injured -- and later saved -- during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.) Jim Ewing is rock climbing again after an experimental surgery that could change the future of amputation. Jim Ewing is rock climbing again after an experimental surgery that could change the future of amputation. On the MIT Media Lab team is Tyler Clites, a Harvard-MIT doctoral candidate in health sciences and technology. He shared a video to demonstrate how sensors on Ewing's left leg track the electrical activity in his muscles, showing results unseen in previous methods of amputation. Within the next few months, Clites said, Ewing should have wireless sensors implanted in his muscles, which will integrate with the robotic prosthetic being created for him. Ewing will be able to point and flex his prosthetic foot and rock his ankle from side to side -- a range of motion made possible by the new surgical approach. Without knowing the intricate details, Mike McLoughlin is intrigued by what Carty and the MIT Media Lab are doing. He's the chief engineer for the research and exploratory development department at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory. In this role, he serves as the principal investigator for the Revolutionizing Prosthetics Program. McLoughlin said his team has made similar strides with upper extremity prosthetics, using electrodes and computers to detect muscle movement and help the brain communicate with the prosthetic. People can imagine opening and closing their hands, for example, and see it happen. What's new here, McLoughlin believes, is the focus on lower extremities. What a hand does is complex, he said, and when we use our hands, we're generally aware of what we're using them for. With feet, we walk and run without thinking about them in the same way. With issues like balance and the need to hold significant weight, he said, what Carty and the MIT Media Lab are attempting involves a different set of challenges. It's a really exciting thing they're doing here, McLoughlin said. I'm anxious to see where they're going with it. A better quality of life Carty's procedure to restore the natural dynamic of limbs should work for both lower and upper extremities, the surgeon said. And though the team hasn't implemented a way to revise the procedure for those who've already experienced an amputation, he said, We have an idea of how that would work. Rather than see amputation as a failure, the result of throwing in the towel, he and others hope this procedure will help people view amputation as a choice, a possibility that may restore a better quality of life. That's certainly been the case for Ewing, who -- even though he hasn't gotten his final robotic prosthesis -- is already grateful. With his temporary prosthesis, he went on a 2-mile walk recently and has returned to climbing indoors. I'm even relearning how to run, though they don't want me running yet, he said. It's so liberating to be moving so quickly and easily. To be a part of this milestone experiment motivated him, he said. It gave him a chance to give back to society in a meaningful way. I literally fell into this situation, Ewing said. I consider it a great honor to have this new protocol bear my name."}

Dementia rates in people over age 65 fell from 11.6 percent in 2000 to 8.8 percent in 2012, a decline of 24 percent, according to a study of more than 21,000 people across the country published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. It's definitely good news, said Dr. Kenneth Langa, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan and a coauthor of the new study. Even without a cure for Alzheimer's disease or a new medication, there are things that we can do socially and medically and behaviorally that can significantly reduce the risk. The decline in dementia rates translates to about one million fewer Americans suffering from the condition, said John Haaga, director of behavioral and social research at the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the new study. Game shows that ability to navigate declines at young age Dementia is a general term for a loss of memory or other mental abilities that's severe enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease, which is believed to be caused by a buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain, is the most common type of dementia. Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia and occurs after a stroke. The new research confirms the results of several other studies that also have found steady declines in dementia rates in the United States and Europe. The new research provides some of the strongest evidence yet for a decline in dementia rates because of its broad scope and diverse ranges of incomes and ethnic groups, Haaga said. The average age of participants in the study, called the Health and Retirement Study, was 75. The study, which began in 1992, focuses on people over age 50, collecting data every two years. Researchers conduct detailed interviews with participants about their health, income, cognitive ability and life circumstances. The interviews also include physical tests, body measurements and blood and saliva samples. While advocates for people with dementia welcomed the news, they noted that Alzheimer's disease and other forms of memory loss remain a serious burden for the nation and the world. Up to five million Americans today suffer from dementia, a number that is expected to triple by 2050, as people live longer and the elderly population increases. The dementia therapy that can be cradled in your arms The number of Americans over age 65 is expected to nearly double by 2050, reaching 84 million, according to the U.S. Census. So even if the percentage of elderly people who develop dementia is smaller than previously estimated, the total number of Americans suffering from the condition will continue to increase, said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach, medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association. Alzheimer's is going to remain the public health crisis of our time, even with modestly reduced rates, Fargo said. Although researchers can't definitively explain why dementia rates are decreasing, Langa said doctors may be doing a better job controlling high blood pressure and diabetes, which can both boost the risk of age-related memory problems. High blood pressure and diabetes both increase the risk of strokes, which kill brain cells, increasing the risk of vascular dementia. Do brain-training exercises really work? We've been saying now for several years that what's good for your heart is good for your head, Fargo said. There are several things you can do to reduce your risk for dementia. Authors of the study found that senior citizens today are better educated than even half a generation ago. The population studied in 2012 stayed in school 13 years, while the seniors studied in 2000 had about 12 years of education, according to the study. That's significant, because many studies have found a strong link between higher educational levels and lower risk of disease, including dementia, Lang said. The reasons are likely to be complex. People with more education tend to earn more money and have better access to health care. They're less likely to smoke, more likely to exercise and less likely to be overweight. People with more education also may live in safer neighborhoods and have less stress. People who are better educated may have more intellectually stimulating jobs and hobbies that help exercise their brains, Lang said. It's also possible that people with more education can better compensate for memory problems as they age, finding ways to work around their impairments, according to an accompanying editorial by Ozioma Okonkwo and Dr. Sanjay Asthana of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Yet Americans shouldn't expect dementia rates to continue falling indefinitely, Haaga said. Although educational levels increased sharply after the World War II, those gains have leveled off, Haaga said. People in their 20s today are no more likely to have graduated from college compared to people in their 60s. We have widening inequality in health outcomes in the U.S., Haaga said. For people without much education, we've had very little improvement in health. The benefits really have gone to those with better educations."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":732,"title":"Game shows that ability to navigate declines at young age%","class":1,"body":"Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world. (CNN)A mobile game has revealed the navigational skills of people around the world in a bid to develop an accurate test for dementia. The smartphone game, called Sea Hero Quest, asks players to set sail on a global adventure in search of precious artifacts -- in the form of memories -- which can be collected at different locations around the world. As you progress through the game, scientists can use the data you generate to gain insight into your navigational abilities, which is one of the first skills people lose during the onset of dementia. What parents should know about the VR gear kids want Initial results, presented at the Neuroscience 2016 conference in San Diego on Wednesday, found that our navigational skills deteriorate from early adulthood and for the rest of our lives, not just in older age, as previously thought. More than 2.4 million people have played the game since its launch in May, generating the equivalent of more than 9,000 years of lab data. In addition to new insight into our navigational decline, the data revealed differences in spatial navigation abilities between genders as well as countries, with Nordic countries coming out on top. The goal was to identify the normal range of navigation skills among humans in general, throughout the world, and to then use this to develop a test or chart to profile people and spot dementia early through any deviance from the norm. This is the only study of its kind, on this scale, to date. Its accuracy greatly exceeds that of all previous research in this area, said Hugo Spiers, a neuroscientist at University College London, who led the research stemming from the game's data. The findings the game is yielding have enormous potential to support vital developments in dementia research, he said in a statement. Deviating from the norm The main finding from the game to date was the discovery that our ability to navigate declines as young as 19, which was the age when researchers began sampling, and continues to do so throughout life. This was highlighted by results from one particular aspect of the game in which gamers are spontaneously asked to shoot a flare in the direction they came from. Brain implant helps woman with ALS communicate Nineteen-year-old users were 74% more likely to shoot the flare accurately on average, but by the age of 75, this had been cut to 46%. We expected it to plateau, maybe in our 60s, but it was actually throughout our lifespan, Spiers told CNN. Men performed this particular task 10% better than women, according to Spiers, but the researchers think this may be down to differences in strategies, in terms of how each gender navigates the seas during the game as a whole -- to find and collect the memories as tasked. Another eye-opener was the differences in scores between countries. Some Nordic nations -- Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark -- were found to have notably better spatial navigation than participants from the other 189 countries. We're discovering some basic principles about humans, Spiers said, adding that this gender and cultural insight all feeds into identifying global norms and when people may be deviating from them due to dementia. How big a problem is dementia?Despite being potentially preventable in one-third of cases, it's estimated that someone develops dementia globally every three seconds. In 2015, more than 46 million people were living with dementia worldwide, according to the World Alzheimer Report 2015 (PDF).The condition is a collection of symptoms, such as memory loss, difficulties in thinking or problem-solving, and reduced ability to navigate. It is caused by diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Dementia is increasingly becoming one of the greatest medical challenges we face globally, said Hilary Evans, chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK. It is a disease you can prevent. ... It's not an inevitable part of aging. Despite the high numbers affected, an accurate test for the condition remains unavailable. But this could be about to change -- depending the next stages of data analyzed from Sea Hero Quest. (The game) can tell us, how do people get lost? Spiers said. Fundamentally, people with dementia -- Alzheimer's dementia -- struggle to navigate, and on a scientific level, we don't know enough of how people navigate to help really pin down what's going wrong, he said. The team has completed one round of its data analysis and will continue to reveal more insight as it comes. All data are anonymous and available only to researchers at University College London.Think yourself thin - can VR technology fight obesity? Step one is establishing this live database of, how do people navigate? ... That gives us the tool to develop that diagnostic, said Spiers. The website that knows what doctors don't Next, researchers will test the game on people known to have Alzheimer's dementia to see whether they can identify any key differences in they subjects' spatial navigation. They then imagine a scenario in which people suffering from dementia can be identified early -- by playing the game -- and given relevant drugs to stop the disease taking full hold of their mind. You could give them (the game) and monitor if the drug is effective in a really powerful way, Spiers said. Next step: Brain imaging In the next stages of the project, Spiers would also like to have volunteers play the game while having their brains scanned in order to see which parts are active and link this to patterns seen in the population worldwide. I hope to collect neuroimaging data from people playing this game to really understand how the circuits are activated as people play the game, he said. This is not the first use of mobile games to crowdsource data for scientists. Cancer Research UK has launched five games, including Play to Cure: Genes in Space in 2014, which obtained data as people traveled through space and helped identify codes and patterns along their way -- unwittingly. Sea Hero Quest became available on iOS and Android on May 4 and was created in a collaboration between Deutsche Telecom, Alzheimer's Research UK, scientists from University College London and the University of East Anglia, and game designers Glitchers. These new insights into how humans navigate have only come as a result of a new kind of collaboration in dementia research, Evans said. A health challenge as complex as dementia demands we approach studies innovatively."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":733,"title":"UK teenager wins battle to have body cryogenically frozen","class":1,"body":" London (CNN)A British teenager who died of cancer has been cryogenically frozen in the United States after winning a court case before her death. The girl -- who can't be identified and is referred to only as JS -- suffered from a rare form of cancer and expressed a hope to be brought back to life and cured in the future. She died on October 17 but details of the case at London's High Court were not allowed to be made public until now. In his judgment, obtained by CNN, Mr. Justice Peter Jackson said the girl had expressed her desire to be cryogenically frozen. What is cryogenic preservation? She wrote: I have been asked to explain why I want this unusual thing done. I'm only 14 years old and I don't want to die, but I know I am going to. I think being cryo-preserved gives me a chance to be cured and woken up, even in hundreds of years' time. I don't want to be buried underground. I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they might find a cure for my cancer and wake me up. I want to have this chance. This is my wish. According to the judgment, the girl's parents are divorced and their relationship is very bad. Her mother was supportive of her wish, but her father -- who had not seen his daughter face-to-face since 2008 -- initially was not. At the start of proceedings, the teenager's father, who also has cancer, wrote: Even if the treatment is successful and [JS] is brought back to life in let's say 200 years, she may not find any relative and she might not remember things and she may be left in a desperate situation given that she is only 14 years old and will be in the United States of America. How does the process of cryogenic freezing work? • The person's body is cooled using an ice bath as soon as possible after he or she is declared legally dead in order to prevent decay to the brain cells and other tissues. • The blood is flushed out and replaced with a cryoprotectant solution, or special non-toxic anti-freeze, to prevent ice crystals forming which would damage the cells. • The body is packed in dry ice for transportation to the place where the final cooling process and storage will take place. • The body is then slowly cooled down to even lower temperatures over several days using liquid nitrogen. Here, physical decay essentially stops. • The body is placed in a storage tank filled with liquid nitrogen.• Keeping a body at such low temperatures is thought to keep cells, tissues and organs intact. • Only a handful of companies in the United States and Russia currently offer cryopreservation. • Proponents of the process say that future advances in science will allow the subjects of cryogenic freezing to be reanimated. • It's thought reanimation will enable any damage to cells to be repaired and fatal diseases to be cured. • But skeptics say that there is no objective evidence yet that a human body will survive cryopreservation with cells that will work again after warming. Sources: Cryonics Institute, Alcor However, he subsequently changed his position, saying he respected the decisions his daughter was making. The judge said this fluctuation in his views was understandable, adding, No other parent has ever been put in his position. But he emphasized he was not ruling on the science of cryonics, but rather on the dispute between her parents over who was responsible for the arrangements after her death. The judge also said there was no doubt the girl -- described as a bright, intelligent young person who is able to articulate strongly held views on her current situation -- had the capacity to start legal action. Over recent months, JS has used the internet to investigate cryonics: the freezing of a dead body in the hope that resuscitation and a cure may be possible in the distant future, he said. The scientific theory underlying cryonics is speculative and controversial, and there is considerable debate about its ethical implications. On the other hand, cryopreservation, the preservation of cells and tissues by freezing, is now a well-known process in certain branches of medicine, for example the preservation of sperm and embryos as part of fertility treatment. Cryonics is cryopreservation taken to its extreme. The judge ruled in favor of her mother and said the girl had died peacefully, knowing her wishes had been met. But he cautioned that hospital officials had had real misgivings about the way the process was handled on the day she died. The girl's mother was said to have been preoccupied with the arrangements after her death, rather than being fully available to her child, he said, and the voluntary organization which helped get her body ready for preservation was disorganized. The case was said by the judge to be the only one of its kind to have come before the courts in England and Wales, and probably anywhere else. It is an example of the new questions that science poses to the law, perhaps most of all to family law, he added. The case at the High Court in London was the first of its kind in England -- and possibly the world. The case at the High Court in London was the first of its kind in England -- and possibly the world. The cost of the procedure in the United States -- which the judge said was about £37,000 ($46,000) -- is being met by her maternal grandparents, he said, although the family is not well off. They chose the most basic arrangement, he said, which simply involves the freezing of the body in perpetuity. The Cryonics Institute, which is based in Michigan, said the body of a 14-year-old girl from London arrived at its facility, packed in dry ice, on October 25, about eight days after her death. The patient was then placed in the computer controlled cooling chamber to cool to liquid nitrogen temperature, a statement posted on its website said. The human cooling program from dry ice was selected and the time needed to cool the patient to liquid nitrogen temperature was 24 hours. The patient was then placed in a cryostat for longterm cryonic storage. The Cryonics Institute said the girl was its 143rd patient. Its website explains the process as a technique intended to hopefully save lives and greatly extend lifespan. It involves cooling legally-dead people to liquid nitrogen temperature where physical decay essentially stops, in the hope that future scientific procedures will someday revive them and restore them to youth and good health. A person held in such a state is said to be a 'cryopreserved patient', because we do not regard the cryopreserved person as being inevitably 'dead'. Can a whole body survive freezing process? However, some skepticism remains about the science of cryogenics. Barry Fuller, professor in Surgical Science and Low Temperature Medicine at University College London, said that cryopreservation has many useful applications in day to day medicine, such as cryopreserving blood cells, sperm and embryos. But, he said, cryopreservation has not yet been successfully applied to large structures, such as human kidneys for transplantation, because we have not yet adequately been able to produce suitable equipment to optimize all the steps. This is why we have to say that at the moment we have no objective evidence that a whole human body can survive cryopreservation with cells which will function after rearming."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":734,"title":"What is cryogenic preservation","class":1,"body":"  (CNN)Cryopreservation is the process by which any living cells, tissues, organs or entire bodies are protected from decay by storing them at extremely low temperatures. The idea is to preserve them for indefinite periods until the rest of science has caught up and technology is available to revive them, bring them back to life and maybe cure the condition that killed them in the first place. Such technology, however, does not yet exist. According to the Cryonics Institute, an US organization that offers the service, the fundamental goal is to give people a second chance at life and extend human lifespans. But scientists who work with cryopreservation on smaller scales for research purposes are skeptical. It is currently science fiction to suggest that a person could be brought back to life in the future even considering technological advances, Dr. Channa Jayasena, clinical senior lecturer in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, said in a statement. Cryonics has risks for the patient, poses ethical issues for society, is highly expensive, but has no proven benefit. If this was a drug, it would never get approved. That said, how does the process workHow does cryopreservation work? The process involves three key steps once someone has been declared legally dead, according to the Cryonics Institute. First, the body is immediately placed in an ice bath. At the same time, a ventilation mask is used to continue providing oxygen to the body's organs -- particularly the brain -- and the anticoagulant heparin and automated CPR are used to maintain blood flow. Body temperature is monitored to ensure a gradual reduction. A dummy is used to demonstrate the first steps of cryopreservation. A dummy is used to demonstrate the first steps of cryopreservation. Next, the body is vitrified, meaning its cells and organs are prepared for the ultra-low temperatures they will soon experience. This involves replacing the body's fluids with injected cryoprotective agents that act as an antifreeze, protecting the body from the damage of becoming frozen. Now that the body is prepped for the cold, the process of controlled cooling begins. This is the final step before long-term storage and involves slowly cooling the body further. The body is placed inside a protective insulating bag and then inside a cooling box where liquid nitrogen is fed in at a steady rate. This takes place slowly, over several days, until the body reaches a temperature of minus-200 degrees Celsius. Once fully cooled, bodies are stored in cryostats indefinitely. Once fully cooled, bodies are stored in cryostats indefinitely. Those offering the service stress the slow and steady rate of the entire process, to ensure the least risk of damage to a person's body. Either before or after the second stage, bodies may be transported to the nearest storage facility to complete the process. Once ready for storage, the body is put inside a liquid nitrogen vessel known as a cryostat. The vessels are not powered by electricity, so they are not affected by power outages. What is neuropreservation? Another, sometimes cheaper, option is neuropreservation, in which only a person's head is preserved on the assumption that information within the brain is the most important for a person to live again and that a new body could be cloned or regenerated. Why do people want cryopreservation? Companies offer the option of cryopreservation on the belief that science, technology and medicine will someday be able to revive patients and even cure or treat the diseases that killed them in order to give them a new chance at life. The Cryonics Institute believes it is allowing people to buy time until technology catches up and is able to fully repair and restore the human body. UK teenager wins battle to have body cryogenically frozen Major League Baseball player Ted Williams, who died in 2002, underwent neuropreservation. His head is cryogenically frozen, awaiting the day it can be attached to a new body and revived. The first person to be cryopreserved was Dr. James Bedford, a psychology professor at the University of California, who was cryonically suspended in 1967 at the age of 73 through Arizona-based Alcor. The company's former vice president Jerry Leaf, who died in 1991, is also frozen. Although only a handful of people have been cryogenically preserved, many more have joined the list to be suspended in liquid nitrogen upon their death. The Cryonics Institute alone has more than 800 members in the United States and more than 100 more worldwide. How much does it cost? The process is expensive. Fees start at $28,000 and go up to $200,000, paid upon death by either the patient or their insurance policy. Companies often also require membership ahead of the procedure and may apply surcharges for people outside the country. Does it work? Cryonics UK, a nonprofit organization, says cryopreservation cannot be guaranteed to work and that it's up to people who want to try it. Barry Fuller, professor in surgical science and low-temperature medicine at University College London, highlighted the benefits the process has had on a smaller level for scientific research. Cryopreservation is a remarkable technology which allows us to store living cells, almost indefinitely, at ultra-low temperatures, he said. It has many useful applications in day-to-day medicine, such as cryopreserving blood cells, sperm and embryos. But he added that this has not been proven viable for entire bodies, though he hopes it can be proved step by step, starting with organs. Cryopreservation has not yet been successfully applied to large structures, such as human kidneys for transplantation, because we have not yet adequately been able to produce suitable equipment to optimise all the steps, he said. This is why we have to say that at the moment, we have no objective evidence that a whole human body can survive cryopreservation with cells which will function after rearming. ... At the moment, we cannot achieve that.Clive Coen, professor of neuroscience at King's College London, is even more skeptical. Despite the claims made by cryonics companies, they've failed to demonstrate that the extraordinary mass of tissue that constitutes the human brain can be protected by the antifreeze that they try to pump through the body after death, he said. This tissue may indeed be safe once it's in liquid nitrogen, but it will have already sustained incalculable and irreversible damage during the preparatory processes. Coen questions whether revival will become a reality. Advocates of cryonics are unable to cite any study in which a whole mammalian brain (let alone a whole mammalian body) has been resuscitated after storage in liquid nitrogen, he said. The companies selling the packages focus on safe storage of the tissue and openly admit that there's no current procedure for resuscitation -- but they gloss over all the damage that's caused while they're preparing the tissue for storage."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":735,"title":"WHO ends Zika public health emergency","class":1,"body":"  (CNN)The Zika virus outbreak and related clusters of microcephaly are no longer a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization said Friday. This ends the declaration made by the organization in February due to the simultaneous spread of the virus and extraordinary clusters of microcephaly among babies born in areas where the virus was spreading. We are not downgrading the importance of Zika. By placing this as a long-term program of work, we are saying Zika is here to stay, said Dr. David Heymann, the chairman of the emergency committee on Zika virus and microcephaly, which made the announcement. WHO: Zika causes microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome In February, it was not known that the virus was the cause of the neurological birth defect. In April, the WHO said the virus definitely causes microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults. The source of the concern was not that there was Zika, it was extraordinary clustering of microcephaly that hadn't been seen before at a time when lots of infection was occurring, Heymann said. The declaration put into motion research, coordination and funding to answer that and many other questions about the virus, which was initially thought to be a mild mosquito-borne disease. Now it's known that in addition to the devastating neurological complications it can cause, the virus can be sexually transmitted.There is still a lot of unknowns here, which is why it's so important to have a multiyear plan and program in place, said Dr. Peter Salama, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program. First known sexual transmission of Zika virus in U.S. was eight years agoAlthough mosquito season has ended in some areas of the world and transmission of the virus has slowed, it is far from gone. This disease is like all endemic diseases that have a seasonal appearance, Heymann said. That is why the WHO's emergency committee recommended the change announced today, emphasizing that Zika is still a high priority. Now, the organization will create a technical committee to handle Zika research, vaccine development and other efforts going forward. A robust longer-term technical mechanism was now required to manage the global response, the committee determined. Fighting Zika&#39;s microcephaly in Brazil, one brain at a time Calling the WHO's action a reasonable decision, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, nonetheless said the organization should be prepared to re-examine the decision if, in fact, we have a resurgence of Zika in South America as we enter into the summer months of January and February in the Southern Hemisphere. Heymann said the WHO was prepared to do so. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that the move does not change the need to continue efforts to combat the virus and its effects. Zika infection continues to be a serious threat to pregnant women, babies born to pregnant women with Zika, and their families. There is still much to learn about the disease. We need to learn more about Zika and its associated complications of microcephaly and other brain abnormalities, such as when Zika infection poses highest risk to a fetus during pregnancy, and the magnitude of that risk, the statement said. As anticipated, the virus is continuing to spread around the world and is circulating in more than 60 countries and territories. Microcephaly and other neurological complications linked to the virus have been reported in at least 28 countries. Of the 2,300 confirmed cases of microcephaly, the majority have been in Brazil, where an increase in babies born with the condition was first seen last year. It's believed that this is only a portion of the actual number of such cases. Thus, the CDC said, It remains crucially important that pregnant women avoid traveling to areas with local transmission of Zika, because of the devastating complications that can occur in fetuses that become infected during pregnancy."}

{"id":737,"title":"Chinese scientists use gene-editing techniques in humans for first time","class":1,"body":"  Hong Kong (CNN)Chinese scientists have become the first in the world to use the revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique in humans. On October 28, genetically modified cells were injected into a patient at the West China Hospital in Chengdu with aggressive lung cancer, according to the scientific journal Nature. The team of scientists, led by Lu You of Sichuan University, extracted immune cells from the patients and edited them using CRISPR-Cas9. The technique knocks out a gene that normally acts as a check on the cell's ability to launch an immune response and prevents it from attacking healthy cells.The modified cells were then multiplied and re-introduced into the patients' bloodstream where, it is hoped, they will home in on the cancer and wipe it out. Liao Zhilin, who handles communications for the team, told CNN everything is going as planned, but would not go into details. He said information on the results and findings of the study would be released when they are ready. On China: Genetically modifying human embryos On China: Genetically modifying human embryos 01:44 Gene-editing CRISPR stands for clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats -- regular patterns of DNA sequences which can be edited out of genes. Cas9 is a type of modified protein injected into a body to work on the DNA, like a pair of scissors that can snip the genes. The technique is based on a decade-old discovery that certain bacterial cells can identify invading viruses and chop up their DNA. CRISPR-Cas9 adapts that technique to allow us to edit genes, removing harmful diseases and even allowing the creation of hybrid human-animal organs to fill the transplant gap. New space race Lu's team is not the only one working on using the gene-editing technique in humans. A planned US trial is due to start in early 2017, using CRISPR-edited genes to treat various cancers. I think this is going to trigger 'Sputnik 2.0', a biomedical duel on progress between China and the United States, which is important since competition usually improves the end product, Carl June, an immunotherapy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, and scientific adviser to the US trial, told Nature. In March 2017, a team at Beijing University hopes to launch three clinical trials using gene-editing against bladder, prostate and renal-cell cancers. One of the most important elements of CRISPR development in China is scale, Christina Larson, a contributing correspondent for Science magazine, told CNN in April. It's being deployed in many different ways, in many different labs. Safety Lu's team plans to treat 10 patients, and the main purpose of the trial is to test its safety. Patients will be monitored for six months to determine whether there are any negative side effects from the treatment. While Lu's trial has been welcomed by other medical practitioners, according to Nature, previous Chinese advances in gene-editing have not been so warmly received. Multiple trials on human embryos by Chinese scientists, while providing potentially live-saving insights into the treatment of HIV and other diseases, have raised ethical questions, particularly with regard to the future potential for so-called designer babies."}

(CNN)Calming activities such as yoga and meditation can be very effective stress relievers, especially when integrated into daily life. However, sometimes stress, like steam trapped under the lid of a boiling pot, needs a more powerful release. There's a common saying in sports for that type of release: Leave it all on the field. Athletes put it into practice by channeling their emotions into the fuel that powers their performance, leaving any and all anxiety, anger, frustration, etc., on the playing field. That's exactly the approach I take toward my high-intensity workouts when I'm looking to blow off steam. It's empowering and cathartic to direct and release my stress through an explosive outlet, such as kicking a heavy bag or slamming a medicine ball to the ground. Although many forms of exercise counter stress by boosting endorphins (our brain's feel-good neurotransmitters), recent research points to higher-intensity exercise offering increased mood-enhancing benefits. According to a study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders in August, moderate and high-intensity exercise demonstrated a greater beneficial impact than low-intensity forms. Build the right workout space for your home What's more, research shows that regular blood-pumping aerobic workouts can reduce your sensitivity to stress over time. Below, I've shared six of my favorite sweat-inducing, stress-releasing exercises. You can do them on their own or combine any or all as part of a HIIT (high-intensity interval training) workout, doing intervals of each exercise with a short rest in between. Don't forget to warm up appropriately prior to performing intense exercise. I always foam roll and do a brief breathing and yoga series for muscle activation and enhancing range of motion. The routine I featured in this article on morning yoga can serve as an effective warm-up.If you're new to high-intensity training, check with your doctor before beginning, and consider hiring a certified trainer for help learning how to safely perform the exercises. You'll only add to your stress if you hurt yourself! Remember that high-intensity exercise requires adequate hydration. Emerging research shows that dehydration can have a negative impact on mood and cognition. So don't counteract the positive effects of your workout; drink plenty of water before, during and after your training sessions. Because sweat-intensive workouts cause us to lose electrolytes that are essential for our bodies' neural and muscular processes and maintaining equilibrium, it's best to rehydrate with an electrolyte-enriched water or sports drink. Prevent back pain like a pro athlete There's nothing quite like taking out your stress on a heavy bag! It provides uniquely satisfying tactile and auditory stimulation that reinforces your sense of release with every kick and punch landed. Of course, not everyone has a heavy bag hanging in their garage gym, like I do. But most gyms and martial arts facilities offer kickboxing classes. If you've never kickboxed before, classes provide the opportunity to learn the techniques for executing different punches and kicks, like the roundhouse kick. When I kickbox, I generally go for three to five rounds of a two-to-one work-to-rest ratio: one minute on the bag practicing a series of punches and kicks, and then an active 30-second rest period of side-stepping or jogging around the bag. Sometimes, we need to push our limits to feel like we've exhausted all of our nervous energy. Tabata drills, created by Japanese scientist Izumi Tabata as a form of HIIT training, provide the perfect platform. The drills consist of the same exercise through eight rounds of 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest for a total of four minutes. Personally, I like to use pushups, but you can do any exercise in this format (e.g., jumping jacks, jumping rope, body-weight squats). If you try pushups, simply do as many as you can with good form for 20 seconds and then rest for 10. Repeat through eight rounds. Due to of the intensity of the drills, by the last couple of rounds, I often end up modifying my pushups by putting my knees down or widening my stance. Don't be afraid to modify the entire time to maintain form and avoid injury. Reboot your get-in-shape Have you ever slammed a door out of frustration? It feels good ... but not very productive. Slamming medicine balls is a much better alternative that also serves as a core-focused total-body exercise. Medicine balls are weighted balls used in a variety of exercises. Slams can be done from standing, kneeling or half-kneeling stances. You can slam the ball straight down, diagonally or rotating to the side. I do three to five rounds of 10 (five on each side) at a two-to-one work-to-rest ratio. Select a ball weight based on what you can safely raise overhead and slam hard enough to bounce and catch on each repetition. When I'm so stressed that I need to pound the pavement, I prefer sprinting over long-distance running. If you decide to sprint off your stress, make sure you add a light run to your warm-up. There's a speed-limit sign on one end of the street 100 yards from our house, so I jog up and back. Then, for my sprints, I perform five sets of 50-yard dashes halfway to the sign, resting in between for three or four times the amount of time I sprinted. Because of the energy system used for sprinting, it's necessary to rest much longer to replenish your body's resources for providing that kind of dramatic energy expenditure. Kettlebell swings Despite being an explosive strength exercise, the flowing, rhythmic nature of kettlebell swings feels like meditation in motion to me. That said, it took me a long time and a lot of practice to perfect my swing form. The flowing movement may look simple to execute, but don't be fooled! A complex series of stabilizing and mobilizing forces is required to safely and effectively swing a kettlebell. There are good videos for beginners to learn proper swing form. The standard starting kettlebell weight is 16 kilograms (about 35 pounds) for men and 8 kilograms (about 18 pounds) for women. I started with 8 kilograms and progressed to 16 kilograms. I practice five sets of 10 to 20 swings, resting for 30 seconds to a minute in between sets. Box jumps When the weight of stress is pulling me down, jumping (symbolically and literally) empowers me to defy that pull. I love box jumps, a form of explosive jump training known as plyometrics. Box jumps are exactly what they sound like: jumping up on a box. When you first start, be conservative with your box height. Twelve to 18 inches is a good starting height range. Don't try to go too high too soon, or your shins will pay for it as you inevitably miss your mark. The goal is not to achieve a high height for low reps but to jump repeatedly for higher reps with grace and control, landing softly each time. I usually practice three rounds of 10, resting for one to two minutes in between. Now that you know some ways to sweat out your stress, don't be afraid to metaphorically leave it all on the field. Go ahead and sprint out your frustrations. Punch and kick your fears away. And slam your stress to smithereens."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":739,"title":" Five yoga strategies to stress less","class":1,"body":"Dana Santas is a certified strength and conditioning specialist, experienced registered yoga teacher and mind-body coach known as the Mobility Maker. She's the yoga coach for the Toronto Blue Jays, Philadelphia Phillies, Tampa Bay Rays, Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Lightning and others in Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the Professional Golfers' Association. (CNN)After dealing with months of stress-inducing election drama, many of us are feeling understandably tense and anxious -- myself included. That's why I'm sharing five of my favorite yoga-based ways to tame tension and regain peace of mind. Because stress takes its toll both mentally and physically, yoga's mind-body approach can be very effective at reducing its impact. As a widely recognized stress-relieving practice, yoga has been shown to mitigate the body's physiological response to stressors. Its primary effectiveness is based on helping practitioners switch from their sympathetic fight or flight nervous system to their parasympathetic rest and restore nervous system. The following five strategies offer ways to leverage yoga's ability to calm the nervous system as well release physical tension and emotional unease. If you're looking to tame tension and find peace, give them a try. Practice a peaceful pause. When you notice yourself reacting to a stressor, like a negative news story or an overly opinionated friend or neighbor, it's helpful to have a means of regaining your sense of peace and composure. Practicing yoga breathing and mindfulness meditation have both been proven to dramatically reduce mental and physical stress; mindfulness meditation was even recently shown to relieve chronic back pain. Build the right workout space for your home The simplest way to meditate is by focusing on your breath. As the only aspect of our autonomic nervous system that we can control, breathing is truly a stress-busting superpower that grants us access to the physiological processes that make us feel stressed. According to Harvard Medical School's Dr. Herbert Benson, we can use our breathing to elicit a relaxation response, lowering heart rate, blood pressure and stress-hormone production. To put this into practice, sit comfortably with your eyes closed and focus on your breathing. Establish a count as follows: five-count inhale, seven-count exhale and three-count pause. Take a minimum of 10 breaths in this manner, but ideally, try to build up to four sets of 10 breaths. This should take about 10 minutes. Roll stress off your shoulders. Emotional stress manifests as physical stress, especially in the neck and shoulders. To release upper-body tension, from standing, clasp your hands behind your back and straighten your arms to the best of your ability as you look up, opening your chest, neck and shoulders. Hold the posture for a few breaths. Release and repeat. You can also shrug off shoulder and neck stress with some shoulder rolls and gentle head turns, like you are shaking your head no slowly. Think: stress -- no, no! Twist away tension. Because muscles work in chains, tension that starts in one area can quickly spread throughout our bodies, especially in our backs and hips. That's why I like to use a kneeling lunge twist that does double duty, twisting away back tension while releasing hip flexors (the muscles of the front of the hips). To do the posture, start in a kneeling lunge with your right leg forward and left knee down, with your left toes curled under. Place your left hand on the outside of your right thigh. Rotate your straight right arm behind you with your palm facing up. Turn your head to follow your right arm. Draw your right shoulder blade down to keep your shoulder from lifting and neck muscles off. Take three long, deep breaths. Repeat on the other side. If balance is an issue, begin with the left side of your body braced against a wall, so you can lean into it when needed. For added comfort, place a folded towel or mat under your back knee. Strike a power pose. Stress-induced anxiety can leave us feeling powerless. But research says you can pose your way back to a sense of power. Although its physiological effects are questionable, research still showed that a majority of participants reported feelings of power while holding an expansive pose. So, regardless of the hormonal impact, if you want to feel powerful, strike an open-body power pose by standing with your arms overhead or outstretched or, even better, with your hands on your hips like Wonder Woman or Superman. For an added sense of power, add a mantra or positive affirmation to your pose. Try one of these phrases that promote feelings of power: I am confident or I feel strong. Repeat it out loud several times or simply concentrate on it for a moment while you hold your power pose. Unplug, rest and recharge. One of the most important strategies for easing stress is to give our bodies and minds time to recover. There's no substitute for a solid night's rest, but sometimes even a short midday nap or 10 minutes lying down comfortably -- even if you're not sleeping or meditating -- can offer a profound recharge. We spend so much time plugged in, receiving a constant influx of news and messages, that any time we can spend unplugged is worthwhile. Lie down comfortably with a bolster or pillow under your legs and set a timer for a desired length of time; eight to 10 minutes is a good starting point. Make sure you are in a different room than your electronic devices, and they're set to do not disturb or turned off. Close your eyes. Notice your breathing and the sense of release and comfort in your legs as they rest on the bolster. If you'd like, you can focus on breathing exercises or meditation, but don't pressure on yourself do so. Try simply being comfortable and content. Allow yourself to think, but don't let yourself take any action on your thoughts; no checking your phone or writing anything down! Remain committed to simply being in your body in your relaxed posture for your designated amount of time, resting and recharging."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":740,"title":" A Little Alcohol Each Day May Cut Your Risk of Stroke","class":1,"body":"THURSDAY, Nov. 24, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Light or moderate drinking may reduce the risk of one type of stroke but not another, while heavy drinking increases the risk of both types, a new study suggests. A research team from England and Sweden reviewed 25 studies as well as national data from Sweden. The investigators reported that consumption of up to two drinks a day was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke (blocked blood flow to the brain), but appeared to have no effect on the risk of bleeding (hemorrhagic) stroke. According to the American Stroke Association, about 87 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes, while the other 13 percent are hemorrhagic. High-to-heavy drinking (two to more than four drinks a day) was associated with an added risk of both types of stroke, according to the findings published online Nov. 23 in the journal BMC Medicine. Our results showed that heavy drinkers were about 1.6 times more likely to suffer from intracerebral hemorrhage and 1.8 times more likely to suffer from subarachnoid hemorrhage. The association between heavy alcohol consumption and these two types of stroke was stronger than that for ischemic stroke, lead author Susanna Larsson said in a journal news release. She is an associate professor of epidemiology at Karolinska Institute in Sweden.The differences between alcohol consumption and type of stroke may be due to the way alcohol affects the body, the study authors noted. Previous research has found an association between alcohol consumption and lower levels of fibrinogen -- a protein in the body which helps the formation of blood clots, Larsson said. While this may explain the association between light-to-moderate alcohol consumption and lower ischemic stroke risk, the adverse effect of alcohol consumption on blood pressure -- a major risk factor for stroke -- may increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke and outweigh any potential benefit, she added. Although the researchers found an association between alcohol and stroke risk, the study does not prove cause and effect. The researchers said factors other than alcohol use may have affected the results.

Experts urge you to keep an eye on eye safety when making your choices.U.S. emergency rooms treated 251,800 toy-related injuries in 2014, according to a report last year from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Forty-four percent of those injuries were to the head and face area. And a recent study in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology said basketball, baseball and air guns caused nearly half of all primary sports-related eye injuries. When giving the gift of sports equipment, Prevent Blindness strongly urges also providing sports eye protection, Hugh Parry, president and CEO of Prevent Blindness, said in a news release from the group. An eyecare professional can provide guidance for the best protection for each sport and athlete, he added. Prevent Blindness also offers these toy safety tips: Don't buy toys that shoot or include parts that fly off, or toys with sharp or rigid points, spikes, rods or edges. Choose toys that will withstand impact and not break into dangerous pieces, and be sure toys are suitable for a child's ability and age. Don't give toys with small parts to young children, because they tend to put things in their mouths. And avoid toys with long strings or cords, especially for babies and very young children. Dispose of uninflated or broken balloons immediately. Read all warnings and instructions on the package, and always supervise children and show them how to use their toys safely. Look for the letters ASTM. This designation means the product meets the national safety standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":742,"title":" Can Protein in Common Skin Bacteria Offer Disease Protection? ","class":1,"body":"Our most common skin bacteria may help shield us from some skin diseases, a new study suggests. Swedish researchers report that Propionibacterium acnes secretes a protein called RoxP that protects against bacteria that are believed to contribute to several skin disorders. Specifically, RoxP protects against skin cell damage called oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen bacteria. UV radiation from the sun is a common cause of oxidative stress on the skin. Oxidative stress is believed to contribute to several skin diseases, including eczema, psoriasis and skin cancer. The protective effect of RoxP is as strong as antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, according to the study published recently in the journal Scientific Reports. This protein is important for the bacterium's very survival on our skin. The bacterium improves its living environment by secreting RoxP, but in doing so it also benefits us, study author Rolf Lood said in a news release from Lund University in Sweden. He is a postdoctoral researcher in Lund's Department of Clinical Sciences. The name Propionibacterium acnes comes from the fact that it was first discovered on a patient with acne. But whether it causes acne is uncertain -- it may have been present merely because it is so common, Lood said. Propionibacterium acnes is found on people with and without skin diseases. But people have different amounts of the bacterium on their skin, which can produce varying amounts of RoxP, Lood noted. The researchers plan further studies in mice and humans. If the study results are positive, they could lead to the inclusion of RoxP in sunscreens and its use in the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, Lood said.

{"id":743,"title":" Can Surgery Trigger Rare Muscle Disorder? ","class":1,"body":"Patients who've recently undergone surgery -- especially those with cancer or autoimmune diseases -- experience slightly higher risks of developing a rare muscle disorder soon afterward, new research suggests. Evaluating 20 years of data, Mayo Clinic scientists found that 15 percent of patients who developed Guillain-Barre syndrome had undergone a surgical procedure in the prior eight weeks.Guillain-Barre is a rare syndrome affecting only about one in 100,000 people. Symptoms include increasing muscle weakness that sometimes leads to total paralysis, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. It can be fatal if it interferes with breathing. I don't think patients for any reason should be dissuaded from undergoing a surgical procedure they need because of this [research], said study author Dr. Sara Hocker. She is an associate professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Out of 50,000 surgical procedures, we found 31 patients [who later developed Guillain-Barre], Hocker added. It's a rarity. Thought to originate in the immune system, Guillain-Barre syndrome has been linked in prior research to respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infections and certain vaccinations, though it can strike anyone. Zika virus may also be connected to Guillain-Barre syndrome. For this study, Hocker and her colleagues reviewed the incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome in Mayo Clinic patients within two months of having a surgical procedure between 1995 and 2014. Those with post-surgical Guillain-Barre were compared to patients who didn't undergo surgery prior to its onset. Of the 208 total patients (average age 55) who developed Guillain-Barre syndrome in that time period, 31 had recently undergone surgery. The average time lapse between surgery and Guillain-Barre onset was 19 days, the study found. Notably, 61 percent of those 31 patients had a known cancer diagnosis, while 29 percent suffered from an autoimmune condition, such as ulcerative colitis, type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, among others. This means patients with cancer within the prior six months were seven times more likely to develop Guillain-Barre syndrome after surgery, and those with autoimmune illnesses were five times more likely, the researchers said. Autoimmune disorders occur when the body attacks its own tissues. Substantial evidence has already been found to support an autoimmune cause of [Guillain-Barre syndrome], Hocker said. Perhaps the surgical procedure itself and the stress of anesthesia triggered an autoimmune reaction in those who were predisposed. What symptoms might post-surgical patients watch out for? Dr. Thomas Mueller, section chief of neurology at Christiana Care Health System in Wilmington, Del., said Guillain-Barre usually starts with tingling in the fingers and toes. But the real hallmark is progressive weakness over days, he said. There's a whole range of [Guillain-Barre syndrome] -- it can be really mild or really severe, Mueller added. Treatment involves blood plasma exchange or infusions of healthy donor antibodies, he said. Dr. Eugene Lai, a neurologist at Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas, said the new findings that seem to link Guillain-Barre syndrome to surgery could still be a coincidence. Lai questioned whether another, unknown factor may have contributed to the results. It's a good start with interesting results that brings people's awareness to a potential trigger for [Guillain-Barre syndrome], Lai said, but more study needs to be done. The association reported by the researchers doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Hocker noted her research was limited by its retrospective nature, which looked back at data that had already been gathered by other researchers. It was largely dependent on what was already written in the [patient] charts, she said. I think having a prospective [forward-looking] registry or other format to dig deeper to the differences between those patients who develop Guillain-Barre syndrome after surgery and those who develop it in the general community would be better. The study was published online Nov. 23 in the journal Neurology: Clinical Practice."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":744,"title":" US Health Spending Grew Especially Fast Last Year","class":1,"body":" U.S. health spending always grows but it grew at an especially fast rate last year as more people got health insurance for the first time and as pricey new hepatitis drugs hit the market. The annual medical spending report from the federal government shows the country spent $3.2 trillion on health care in 2015, 5.8 percent more than in 2014. Health Spending Project Hope This adds up to close to $10,000 per person — $9,990 to be precise, far more per capita than in any other comparable country. Health care spending grew 2.1 percentage points faster than the overall economy in 2015, the team at the Office of the Actuary at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reported Friday. Health spending also grew rapidly last year and much of it's because so many more people have health insurance than before, CMS said. There are indications that people who'd been sick for some time were seeking medical care for the first time, said CMS's Aaron Catlin, who worked on the report. Following five consecutive years of historically low growth, from 2009 through 2013, health spending growth accelerated in 2014 (to 5.3 percent) and 2015 (to 5.8 percent), the team wrote in their report, published in the journal HealthAffairs. The faster growth in 2014 and 2015 occurred as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded health insurance coverage for individuals through Marketplace health insurance plans and the Medicaid program. PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE SPENDING INCREASED 7.2 PERCENT IN 2015. CMS says 20 million Americans have health insurance because of the ACA, widely known as Obamacare. Roughly half have bought private health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges and half have coverage in the states that agreed to expand their Medicaid programs. Now 90 percent of Americans have health insurance coverage. Obamacare has been under fire because of rising health insurance premiums, and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly voted to repeal it. President-elect Donald Trump at first said he'd repeal it but now says he would ask Congress to keep many of its provisions. Trump's nominee as Health and Human Services secretary, Georgia rep. Tom Price, has been an Obamacare opponent while his nominee to head CMS, which administers the ACA, is health consultant Seema Verma. Verma helped negotiate a custom-made expansion of Medicaid in Indiana.The federal government currently foots the whole bill for Medicaid expansion, and that helped fuel the growth in federal health spending, the report showed. The acceleration in total health care spending growth in 2015 was primarily driven by faster growth in spending on private health insurance, hospital care, and physician and clinical services, the report reads. Private health insurance spending increased 7.2 percent in 2015 (up from 5.8 percent in 2014). In all, private health insurance, which accounts for one-third of all health spending, reached $1.1 trillion last year. Americans spent $338 billion of their own money on health care, up 2.6 percent from 2014, the report found. Spending on prescription drugs grew at an especially high rate — up 9 percent over 2014 for a total of $324.6 billion. Recent rapid growth was due to increased spending for new medicines (particularly for specialty drugs such as those used to treat hepatitis C), price growth in existing brand-name drugs, increased spending on generics, and a decrease in the number of expensive blockbuster drugs whose patents expired, the report read. RECENT RAPID GROWTH WAS DUE TO INCREASED SPENDING FOR NEW MEDICINES (PARTICULARLY FOR SPECIALTY DRUGS SUCH AS THOSE USED TO TREAT HEPATITIS C). Catlin named two specific drugs helping drive that increase: Sovaldi, knowns generically as sofosbuvir, and Harvoni, a combination pill that includes Sovaldi. Both are made by the drug company Gilead. Last year it would have been Sovaldi, Catlin told reporters. This year it would have been Harvoni. Sovaldi costs about $84,000 for a weeks-long regimen that can cure someone of hepatitis C. Harvoni costs more than $94,000 for similar treatment. Hepatitis C affects about 3.2 million Americans, once killing more than 15,000 each year. Gilead argues that the expensive cure costs less than treating a patient for a lifetime with less effective drugs."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":745,"title":"Should I Worry About Zika? Your Questions Answered ","class":1,"body":" Zika has now spread locally in Florida and Texas, infecting more than 200 people presumably bitten by local mosquitoes. The virus has infected hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people across Latin America and thousands have carried it back to the U.S. Mosquito season is done in most of the northern hemisphere but it's still hot in the Caribbean and it's late spring south of the equator. Here's what's known about who should worry about Zika virus: Pregnant women By far those at the highest risk are pregnant women. Zika causes a range of birth defects, from brain damage so profound it causes the pregnancy to miscarry, to horrifying cases of microcephaly, to subtler defects of limbs and joints. It's not yet clear what percentage of pregnant women go on to have babies with birth defects, but studies show pregnancies in all three trimesters can be badly affected. Women who never remember having had symptoms have had their babies affected, as have women who suffer rashes and muscle aches. Doctors now caution all pregnant women to stay away from places where Zika is spreading if at all possible, and if not, to wear mosquito repellent, to cover up with long sleeves and pants, and to stay inside with air conditioning as much as possible. Women who don't live in areas where Zika can spread can relax a little but should remember that Zika can be spread sexually and that people can come back infected from Zika zones. Related: She's pregnant and worried about Zika Partners of pregnant women Zika is spread sexually as well as by mosquitoes, so any sex partner of a pregnant woman, or a woman who might get pregnant, needs to take precautions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that men who may have been infected use a condom for the duration of a sex partner's pregnancy. Women who may have been infected need to put off getting pregnant for at least eight weeks and because the virus can live in semen for six months or longer, men who may have been infected should avoid unprotected sex for at least that long. Zika doesn't always cause symptoms so people need to be aware that if they've been somewhere that Zika is spreading, it's possible they were infected and did not notice. Women thinking about getting pregnant or who might get pregnant accidentally Close to half of all U.S. pregnancies are unplanned, so it's important for all women of childbearing age - and their sex partners — to be aware of the risk. The Aedes mosquitoes that spread Zika can sneak around, unnoticed. It bites stealthily. It sneaks up on people quietly and bites them on their ankles, noted CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden. Aedes live year-round in much of the southern coastal states and in the summer in 25 states, as well as in many vacation areas in Latin America and the Pacific. And Zika can be spread by all kinds of sex, so people are at risk from travelers to those regions, as well. We are not going to stop travel. There are 40 million air trips and about 200 million travelers to Zika-affected areas every year, Frieden said. And four out of five people infected don't even know it. Anyone who's had dengue Dengue virus is a close relative of Zika, and doctors know it can have strange effects. Someone's first case of dengue is usually mild and sometimes, like Zika, they don't even notice it. But the second time they are infected, symptoms can be severe. It's not fully understood why, but dengue seems to interact with the immune system in ways that make an infection worse the second or third times. There are some early scientific studies that suggest people previously infected with dengue might be more vulnerable to Zika, although others suggest they may have some immune protection from it. Zika does appear to be fairly harmless in most people. In the worst cases, it can cause an annoying rash, extreme tiredness, achy muscles, fever and headache. But it does sometimes lead to a rare complication called Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes usually temporary paralysis. A young man died of Guillain-Barre in Puerto Rico in early August, officials there report. There's no way to predict who is at risk of Guillain-Barre. And a mouse study published in mid-August found that Zika may get into adult brain cells and damage them. It is not clear if this happens in people or what the effects might be, but Zika keeps delivering unpleasant surprises the more scientists study it. Plus, anyone who gets infected can carry the virus. People who have sex can transmit it that way, and infected people can infect mosquitoes, which could bite an unsuspecting pregnant woman. People and mosquitoes alike are vectors for Zika, so the fewer vectors there are, the less likely the virus is to spread. Whoever carried the virus to Miami may never have suspected they were infected. If you return from affected places, even if you feel fine you should try to wear mosquito repellent so you don't infect a mosquito, advises Scott Weaver, an expert on viruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch. I'm surprised I haven't seen signs in airports telling people this, Weaver added. Once transmission begins, we may not discover it for several weeks. By that time, it will be hard to control."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":746,"title":"Another Miami Neighborhood Is Cleared of Zika Virus","class":1,"body":" Florida state officials declared a second outbreak of Zika over in the Miami area, this one in a neighborhood known as Little River or Little Haiti. But federal health officials said pregnant women need to take care in the entire Miami area and should stay out of the south Miami Beach area if at all possible. Zika virus has been spreading locally in various parts of Miami since July. South Florida is home to the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that transmit the virus and has plenty of travelers who can carry it with them from other countries hard-hit by the virus.Texas also announced its first locally transmitted case of Zika in recent days. The Brownsville area of south Texas was always considered prime potential territory for Zika since it's also home to Aedes mosquitoes and has seen outbreaks of dengue, a similar virus. The Little River area of Miami is no longer considered to be an area of active Zika virus transmission (red area). It is now designated as a Zika cautionary area (yellow area), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. There have been no new cases of local Zika virus transmission identified in the Little River area for more than 45 days, suggesting that the risk of Zika virus infection is no longer greater than in the rest of Miami-Dade County. The red areain South Miami Beach will continue until 45 days pass without new cases. The remainder of Miami-Dade County continues to have the yellow area designation. Florida has reported 240 home-grown cases of Zika virus and 958 cases carried or transmitted by travelers. Of these, 173 have involved pregnant women. THE LITTLE RIVER AREA OF MIAMI IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO BE AN AREA OF ACTIVE ZIKA VIRUS TRANSMISSION. The main risk is to babies of women infected while pregnant. The virus causes severe birth defects. There's no vaccine against Zika and no treatment for infection, which is mild and almost undetectable in most people. The main way to fight Zika is to eradicate mosquitoes. The $17 million we have spent on Zika prevention and response in our community to date has been money well spent, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said in a statement. The CDC said women still need to be cautious. Women and men living in or who traveled to the identified Little River area should be aware this location was considered a red area from Oct. 13 to Dec. 2, 2016, it said.

Maintenance is a huge consideration for pet owners bringing a new canine companion into their homes, and some breeds are easier to care for than others. The choice may be a bit easier now. That’s because PetBreeds, a pets research site powered by Graphiq, has collected data on which dog breeds are the lowest maintenance. The site’s data journalists used information from multiple sources, including Animal Planet, the American Kennel Club and DogChannel.com, to identify the 25 lowest-maintenance dog breeds among the top 100 most popular breeds in America. These are the dogs that require little grooming, shed the least, need minimal exercise and are easy to train. So which dogs made the cut? The data shows that the Boston terrier, the miniature bull terrier and the German pinscher are all great low-maintenance choices for pet owners. Also on the list is the beloved Labrador retriever, which the American Kennel Club ranked number one for popularity in 2015. This dog only requires occasional grooming, but it does shed regularly. The pup’s demeanor makes it easy to train, which also factors into its low-maintenance reputation. Some surprises also made the list. Less popular breeds, like the Schipperke and the Spinone Italiano – which ranked 108th and 112th on the AKC’s 2015 list – were classified as low-maintenance.

Do you want a dog that will easily learn to fetch your paper, live the longest or perform Lassie-level heroics? Perhaps you want the best of everything and seek a pup that is a jack of all doggy trades.Many pet-seekers choose to adopt purebred dogs because they tend to exhibit traits unique to their breed. A mixed-breed mutt brings a wild card quality that some potential owners choose not to explore. If you have decided on adopting a purebred dog, the next step is to sift through the overwhelming variety of dog breeds (the American Kennel Club currently recognizes 189).To streamline this process, the team at PetBreeds looked at key factors that go into choosing the optimal furry companions. Our data scientists created a Best Dog Breed index that takes into account a dog breed’s standard characteristics. The index is on a scale of 0-100, with 100 being the highest. The attributes were weighted as follows: •  popularity American Kennel Club rankings (25 percent) •  talents (17.5 percent)•  health (17.5 percent) •  personality traits (15 percent) •  life expectancy (10 percent) •  trainability (10 percent) As a result of these curated qualities, the top-ranking dog breeds are generally talented, healthy and well-liked by owners. PetBreeds ranked all the purebred dogs according to their Best Dog Breed index score and created a list of the top 25 breeds, with the lowest index score going first."}

But sometimes, they can bite you in the butt … literally. Reports surface every year with dog bite statistics, chronicling researchers’ different methodologies when determining what counts as a dog attack. The 2014 report Dog attack deaths and maimings, U.S. & Canada (1982-2014), compiled by ANIMALS 24-7editor Merritt Clifton, is one of them. The report aimed to structure data regarding dog breed attacks as reported in the news. Though some argue that the use of press accounts is not the most reliable approach, Clifton argues that media coverage is legitimate because it is multi-sourced, incorporating information from police reports, animal control reports, witness accounts, victim accounts in many instances, and hospital reports. After taking a closer look at the methodology, PetBreeds concluded that this report gave a sufficietly thoughtful and unbiased summary of dog attacks in the United States. Methodology We acknowledge that the data can be evaluated in a few different contexts (breed-specific behavior, bite frequency relative to frequency of severe injuries, degree of relative risk), but instead of drawing definitive conclusions, we decided to simply show the number of attacks.We focused on the number of attacks doing bodily harm in the last 32 years, which includes fatalities, maimings (loss of limb or disfigurement) and other severe injuries that required hospital treatment. The dogs included in the statistics are only those whose breed has been clearly identified and have been kept as pets. The report also excluded police and guard dogs at work. In an ideal world, we’d use a report that factored in the total number of attacks by each breed in the United States, but that information is not readily available.Before we get on with the list, we wanted to make one thing very clear: Just because a dog breed has been involved n an attack does not mean that breed, as a whole, should be condemned. Every dog has a different personality and is shaped by the environment in which he grows up.

Unexpected veterinary charges, puppy finishing school and soiled carpets are among the costs that prospective dog owners often don’t factor in. While a puppy’s love might be priceless, its upkeep definitely has a cost associated with it. Apart from the puppy price or adoption fee, dog owners must also ensure that their pooches are medically accounted for. Tacking onto the initial veterinary costs, canine gear that includes (but is not limited to) collars, crates and carrier bags must also be purchased early on. To keep dogs healthy and happy, owners must invest in the maintenance of their pooches' lifestyles.

{"id":801,"title":"Could this crab have the most crushing claws?","class":1,"body":"The enormous claws of a coconut crab may be more powerful than they look – and they look pretty scary. The crab native to islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans can grow up to a leg-span of 3 feet and a weight of nearly 9 pounds, making it the largest terrestrial crab. Being such massive animals, coconut crabs (Birgus latro) try to eat whatever they can get their burly claws on. While that mostly means vegetation like the hard-shelled coconut for which they are named, they are also know to prey on other small animals like kittens. Anyone who has ever tried to crack open a coconut without tools knows this is quite the feat, even for a 9-pound crab. So a team of scientists decided to measure exactly how much force these hefty crustaceans can exert when they pinch their prey. As it turns out, the coconut crab's claw can pinch with a force greater than that of any other crustacean that has been measured, according to a paper published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE. The 9-pound crustacean could exert a force of up to 3,300 newtons , according to the new research. That's more than 4.5 times as forceful as the grip strength of most humans. As for the top land-dwelling predators, crocodiles top the crabs with bite forces of about 16,460 newtons. But the crabs come closer to hyenas, lions, and tigers, which snap their jaws shut with a force of about 4,450 newtons. (It is important to note that the coconut crabs do not snap their pinchers shut like the big cats' jaws. It's more of a crushing force than a sudden snap.) We expected the force would be very strong. But the actual powers exceeded our expectation, study lead author Shin-ichiro Oka, a chief researcher at the Okinawa Churashima Foundation in Japan, writes in an email to The Christian Science Monitor. And we were also surprised that their pinching force was approximately 90 times of their body weight, he says. If he himself were a coconut crab, Mr. Oka points out, at about 145 pounds, he could crush something with about 6 tons of force. So what is behind these massive pinching forces? One of the things that crabs have is a very large concentration of muscle fibers that have a unique property, being exceptionally long sarcomeres, Graeme Taylor, a biologist at Western University in Canada who studies animal biomechanics but was not part of the coconut crab study, explains in a phone interview with the Monitor. Sarcomeres are a component in skeletal muscles that make it able to contract, so by having especially long sarcomeres, he says, what that enables the crabs to do, in fact, is be able to produce a quite large force per unit area of muscle. Calculations suggested that coconut crabs' sarcomeres should have been particularly long for the animal's strength. But when the researchers measured the coconut crab's sarcomeres, they weren't even close to how long they should have been (although they were still significantly longer than those in species other than crabs). So the researchers say there must be other morphological characteristics behind the powerful pinchers. The researchers suggest that coconut crabs may have evolved such forceful claws as they adapted to their terrestrial lifestyle. As cousins of hermit crabs, coconut crabs start out life in a shell shelter, but as they become adults they shed the shell, and develop harder and bigger bodies. The crabs also often physically fight over resources, so such hefty claws serve as powerful weapons. Their mighty claws also allow them to be active predators by facilitating effective hunting and feeding on other terrestrial organisms with hard exteriors, thereby aiding in the maintenance of their large body size, the researchers write in their paper. In particular, the ability of these crabs to open coconuts demonstrates the impressive force of their claws. Approaching these crabs in the wild and getting them to clamp their claws down on force-sensing devices proved tricky. As the researchers write, During our field study, obtaining data for analysis was challenging, as the large claws of this crab pinched us on multiple occasions."}

Asteroid Day’s shocking new video is a wake-up call to humanity, urging scientists, politicians and the public to take the threat seriously. Astronomer Patrick Michel said our solar system is packed full of gigantic space rocks, some of which are more than 1 kilometer (1,100 yards) in size. We are tracking the movements of about 90 percent of these asteroids, which would wipe out humanity if they plowed into Earth. This means there are a vast number of rogue rocks that could be on a collision course with our planet. But these gigantic objects are not the only threat to our civilization. Michel said: We only know about 15 or 20 percent of the objects which are larger than a few hundred meters in size. If these bodies impact Earth, they can cause regional damage across a whole country or even a continent. There are several proposed ways to tackle asteroids. The first would involve a gravity tractor, which is essentially a spaceship designed to tug the rock onto a new path using its own gravitational pull. Others would involve blasting the space rock with some sort of projectile to try to steer it onto a new course, or even blowing it up with a nuke. However, this could backfire on humanity because it would cause radioactive rock fragments to rain down on the planet. Astronomer Carolyn Shoemaker is an expert on asteroids. She discovered Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which broke apart and spectacularly plunged into Jupiter. She called for more study of doomsday space rocks. The more we learn about all of these objects, she said, the more we can be prepared for preventing an impact that would be dangerous to us."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":803,"title":"Shoreline Gentry Are Fake Climate Victims","class":1,"body":"The fake news problem is getting serious. An example appeared on the front page of the New York Times on Friday, under the headline Rising Seas Turn Coastal Houses Into a Gamble. Supposedly elevated sea levels caused by global warming have homeowners and developers worried about the value of their coastal properties. Supposedly their concern has been heightened by the election of Donald Trump, who has long been a skeptic of global warming. Supposedly the Trump selection of Myron Ebell, a policy specialist who challenges the media consensus on global warming, to head the EPA transition has intensified these worries in Florida and among many climate scientists. The emphasis is ours—though, of course, it’s probably true that somebody in Florida buys the thesis of this story, even if it’s just a Times reporter passing through. Only in the second half of a 3,099-word opus is the truth not so much revealed as hinted. Halting and piecemeal reform of the federal flood-insurance subsidy program that has so benefited wealthy seaside homeowners is why beach-front housing prices are being reset. A Sarasota couple found it harder to sell their Florida house when shoppers noticed a $7,000 annual flood insurance bill. This experience will become more common, economists say, as the federal government shifts away from subsidizing flood insurance rates to get premiums closer to reflecting the true market cost of the risk, the paper notes in passing. Bingo. When Teddy Roosevelt built his Sagamore Hill on Long Island, he did so a quarter mile from shore at an elevation of 115 feet not because he disdained proximity to the beach or was precociously worried about climate change. The federal government did not stand ready with taxpayer money to defray his risk. Estimates vary, but sea levels may have risen at two millimeters a year over the past century. Meanwhile, tidal cycles along the U.S. east coast range from 11 feet every day (in Boston) to two feet (parts of Florida). On top of this, a notable surge event can produce a storm surge of seven to 23 feet, according to a federal list of 10 hurricanes over the past 70 years. We should not exaggerate the degree to which homeowners are being asked to shoulder their own risks. Washington is doling out five-figure checks to Jersey homeowners to raise houses on pilings to reduce the federal government’s future rebuilding costs. But, to state the obvious, normal tidal variation plus storm surge is the danger to coastal property. Background sea-level rise is a non-factor. A FEMA study from several years ago found that fully a quarter of coastal dwellings are liable to be destroyed over a 50-year period. Though it pleased New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to pretend Superstorm Sandy in 2012 was caused by global warming, the storm wasn’t even a hurricane by the time it hit shore—it just happened to hit at peak tide. Sure, certain people in Florida and elsewhere like to conflate the two. It’s in their interests to do so. But the Times is not obliged to make front-page climate propaganda out of a false syllogism. Alas, climate change is one of the worst things to happen to journalism. Our industry’s base of financial support was already being eroded by digital economics. Our intellectual credibility is assailed by fake news, on one hand, and by the rise of bloggers, on the other, many of whom are more perceptive, disciplined thinkers. Climate change is the cheapest grace on offer these days. Climate reporters aren’t expected to understand the science or its limits—understanding is actively discouraged. Just memorize the word consensus and fling denier at anybody who proves inconvenient. This column, for instance, says nothing about the role of fossil fuels in climate change. It doesn’t mention that President Obama’s policies would have no effect on climate change, so the transition to President Trump will have no effect either. The only thing being denied is that climate change is the major factor in repricing shoreline property. Its author will be called a denier anyway. The emperor’s new clothes is our most important parable of groupthink. It reminds us that a certain kind of cowardice expresses itself not as fear but as joy—joy at conformity, joy at being part of a mob, joy at being immune to criticism no matter how bovine your reporting because you exhibit the right stance on climate change."}

The space agency recently announced the selection of Space Exploration Technologies to provide launch services for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.  Launch is targeted for April 2021 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex-4 East on South Base, NASA officials said. The total cost for NASA to launch SWOT is approximately $112 million, which includes the launch service; spacecraft processing; payload integration; and tracking, data and telemetry support. Designed to make the first-ever global survey of Earth’s surface water, in addition to high-resolution ocean measurements, the SWOT mission will collect detailed measurements of how water bodies on Earth change over time, NASA officials said in a statement. The satellite will survey at least 90 percent of the globe, studying Earth's lakes, rivers, reservoirs and oceans, at least twice every 21 days. The data, NASA representatives said, will aid in freshwater management around the world, and improve ocean circulation models and weather and climate predictions. The SWOT spacecraft will be jointly developed and managed by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). The new contract comes as SpaceX works to return Falcon 9 to flight following a mishap during testing in Florida Sept. 1. The investigation team is focusing on a breach in the cryogenic helium system of the second stage liquid oxygen tank for the fiery mishap. In late October, SpaceX officials said they had not confirmed the root cause of the breach. SpaceX representatives said they were working toward returning to flight before the end of 2016."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":805,"title":"How Cassini Will Begin Its Date With Death on Saturn Trilobites","class":1,"body":"It’s the beginning of a spectacular, almost circuslike end for NASA’s Cassini mission. For 12 years Cassini has been buzzing about Saturn, its rings and its moons. As a result we know that there are methane lakes on Titan and jets of water shooting from Enceladus, and the rings themselves have warps, ripples, hills twists and braids. Now the Cassini spacecraft has gradually shifted into an orbit that takes it over the planet’s north and south poles and then down into a series of increasingly vertiginous-looking dives perpendicular to the plane of its buttery glowing rings. Starting on Wednesday, as shown here, with a gravitational nudge from the moon Titan, Cassini is set to commence a series of 20 dives just outside the outer edge of the main ring system. Along the way the spacecraft will try to sample ring particles and gases that live there in its vicinity, and pass only 56,000 miles above Saturn’s cloud tops. In April, Cassini will shift its orbit again to slice between the planet and the rings, sneaking as close as 1,012 miles from the clouds of Saturn in 22 more orbits. Finally, on Sept. 15, at 8:07 a.m., Earth time in New York, the spacecraft will crash into the clouds of Saturn and burn up. Science will never be the same. Nor will Saturn, now forever polluted by a few stray atoms from the blue planet. Thereafter, there will always be a little piece of Earth on Saturn."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":806,"title":" Fireball Lights Up Florida Night Sky: What’s Happening?","class":1,"body":"In the late evening of Nov. 23, people from Key West to the Florida Panhandle observed a massive fireball streaking across the sky. Most of the people who observed the strange occurrence panicked, thinking that it may be a bright meteor or even an extraterrestrial ship landing on Earth. The fireball was spotted mainly in Florida, but residents from Georgia and Alabama reported the event as well. A Meteorological Occurrence The American Meteorological Society as well as different police departments from the affected areas received dozens of reports from people who witnessed the bizarre phenomenon around 11 p.m. local time. The phenomenon was confirmed by dashboard cameras belonging to the North Point Police Department in West Florida. As reported by Bill Cooke of Marshall Space Flight Center, the meteor began 46 miles above the Gulf of Mexico and 8 miles from Sarasota. According to the reports, the object was most likely traveling from northwest into the sea of Anna Maria Island, near the coast of Manatee County, Florida. The same report cites that the fireball must have been the size of a baseball, moving with roughly 40,000 miles per hour. The object was classified as a bolide, not a superbolide, and it produced no damage in the areas where it was seen. A number of approximately 500,000 fireballs pass around our planet every year, which makes the phenomenon not that uncommon. However, since most of the fireballs are smaller and some occur during the daytime, many of them go unnoticed. This meteor vaporized into a fireball illumination due to the interaction of frozen water and carbon dioxide heating the object. If you're interested in observing as many of these phenomena as possible, try using a telescope. Story Of A Meteor Regardless of how common these occurrences are, people got scared and began writing on social media about their experiences. After the police department uploaded the video on their Facebook page, comments begun to flow. It looked like a flare last night. I was driving on I-75 north at about 11:20 and the thing came right above me and just disappeared slowly, said Victor Rath on the Facebook post of the North Port Police Department. Another commenter thought that the phenomenon may have been something different. That is definitely what I saw the other night. At the time I wondered [i]f it were an electrical transformer or something, Donna Launonen wrote on the same Facebook post. The video now has around 80,000 views, over 600 likes and more than 1,600 shares.

{"id":807,"title":"These Fijian Ants Have Been Farming Long Before Humans Were: Study ","class":1,"body":"Fijian ants began planting fruit crops millions of years before ancient humans did, a new study revealed. Researchers from the University of Munich in Germany reconstructed the evolutionary history of the relationship between Fijian ants and fruit plants. They found a mutually beneficial agreement between the two, in which both partners profit from the relationship. Fijian Farming Ants Professor Susanne Renner and her student Guillaume Chomicki discovered that Fijian ants started to cultivate fruit plants more than 3 million years ago, long before humans did. And as it turned out, colonies of the Fijian ant (Philidris nagasau) grow and harvest epiphytes that grow harmlessly upon another tree. These epiphytes include the Squamellaria fruit plants, which grow on branches and are endemic to the island of Fiji. What happens is that Fijian ants first gather seeds from the Squamellaria fruit plants then seek out fissures or cracks in the bark of the host tree. If they find one, the ants will plant the seeds in these spaces, where the seed will germinate. Worker ants watch over these planting sites and possibly fertilize them with their feces, researchers said. As the fruit plants grow, they form large and round hollow structures at the base known as domatia where the Fijian ants will reside instead of building their nests. When the fruit has appeared, the Fijian ants eat them and collect the seeds for future farming. The cycle begins again. A Network Of Ant Farms Scientists discovered that each Fijian ant colony farmed dozens of fruit plants at the same time, producing a trail that links them to one another. These connected network of ant farms often spanned several trees that were adjacent to each other. The plants colonize three or four tree species, said Renner. The professor explained that these tree species are attractive for ants either because their bark is especially soft, which helps ants widen the fissures, or because they produce nectar. Chomicki, who is a graduate student at the university, said dozens of ant colonies have been found to be linked by ant highways on a single tree. All these ant colonies are the progeny of a single queen, which lays her nest in the center of the system, said Chomicki. Profound Symbiosis Researchers said the mutual benefits for Fijian ants and fruit plants are so profound that neither can survive without the other. This symbiosis may have been the result of evolutionary adaptations that pushed them to be compatible."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":808,"title":"Space Food: NASA Developing High Calorie Bars For Deep Space Missions","class":1,"body":"When you consider food eaten by astronauts in space from a utility point of view, you don’t have to think of only nutrition, shelf-life, taste and variety; you also need to account for another factor — the space it occupies. And this last factor becomes especially important when we talk about missions to deep space, such as the planned Orion missions. According to NASA, Orion will take human exploration of our solar system much farther than at present, including to Mars. Till now, humans have gone only as far as the moon, while the other bodies in our immediate neighborhood having been seen firsthand only by machines we have sent out. The first Orion mission is planned for as early as 2021. Unlike the International Space Station (ISS), however, Orion will be short on space. Since the spacecraft needs to go farther than man has ever gone before, and every ounce of weight onboard takes up that much more fuel, it is imperative to keep down the size of the vehicle as much as possible, and to use the space within as efficiently. And since Orion will travel to deep space, there will be no supply ships going to restock it and to take away its waste. This is in sharp contrast to ISS, where astronauts can choose from about 200 items for their meals. But the crews of Orion will still need all their nutrition to keep them healthy and alert. And so, food scientists at NASA are developing high-calorie food bars. On Orion, the goal is to have a number of food bars to select from in a variety of flavors like orange cranberry or barbeque nut for their first meal of the day, reducing the amount of space and storage the breakfasts require. For lunch and dinner, Orion astronauts will be able to select from similar items space station crew members eat and have a food warmer to help them prepare their meals, NASA said in a statement. However, that first part about the food bars was easier said than done. When you have 700 to 900 calories of something, it’s going to have some mass regardless of what shape it’s in, so we’ve taken a look at how to get some mass savings by reducing how we’re packaging and stowing what the crew would eat for breakfast for early Orion flights with crew, Jessica Vos, deputy health and medical technical authority for Orion, said in the statement. Takiyah Sirmons, a food scientist with the Advanced Food Technology team at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, added: There’s no commercially-available bar right now that meets our needs, so we’ve had to go design something that will work for the crew, while trying to achieve a multi-year shelf-life. NASA is also working on growing fresh food in space. In August 2015, astronauts grew, and ate, red romaine lettuce aboard ISS, and a new plant growing chamber — called the Advanced Plant Habitat — is due for delivery to the orbiting space station some time in 2017. Food in long-duration space missions important not only for nutrition of mission crew, but also because the availability of variety in food choices will affect morale positively and ensure the crew consumes enough food."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":809,"title":"Coaxing A Brand New Bond Out Of Biology","class":1,"body":"It’s hard to believe, but 2016 is the year that an enzyme first bonded an atom of silicon—one of the most abundant elements on Earth–to an atom of carbon—the element fundamental to life as we know it. Almost every biological molecule we know of—proteins, sugars, DNA, you name it—is based on a string of carbon atoms bonded together. Enzymes in our bodies, in other animals and in plants and microbes are adept at attaching one carbon to another. But none of those enzymes, so far as we know, have ever bothered to attach a carbon to a silicon. Considering that silicon is the second most plentiful element in Earth’s crust after oxygen, and that carbon and silicon are just about as similar as two elements can be, that’s pretty surprising. The idea of silicon-based life has long tantalized scientists; it even made an appearance on Star Trek in the form of the rock-eating Horta. Silicon is also a key component of computer chips and other electronic devices. Now Caltech chemist Frances Arnold and her team have taken the very first steps in that direction. They coaxed a natural protein called cytochrome c into joining a silicon and oxygen. Cytochrome c doesn’t even usually make bonds, which is to say it’s not a natural enzyme. Then they did one better, mutating the protein so it performed the reaction even more efficiently. When her group was done, their modified enzyme was 15 times better at the reaction than human chemists. They describe their work in a paper out today in Science. What I find most interesting is what nature can do if you only ask. Here’s a bond not found in nature, but a natural protein is happy to do it given the right environment, says Arnold. And we can make it better by directed evolution. One thing Arnold’s enzymes are really good at is making specific configurations of the product molecules. That’s especially important in biology, where it’s not just the ingredients of a molecule that matters but the shape too, so it will fit correctly with proteins. Chemists are excited about the possibilities she’s unlocked. The ability to control shape means the enzymes her group has made could be useful for making new drug molecules that incorporate silicon. Frances has opened up an entire new toolbox for synthetic organic chemists to make interesting new compounds, says Andrew Ellington, a biochemist at the University of Texas, Austin."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":810,"title":"Dino-Killing Asteroid Made Rocks Behave Like Liquid","class":1,"body":"A study of the massive crater that formed when an asteroid crashed into Earth 66 million years ago, wiping out all nonavian dinosaurs and most life on the planet, is giving insights into how impacts can help shape planets and possibly even provide habitat for the origins of life. The study, published in the journal Science on Nov. 17, represents the first findings from the expedition that drilled into the peak ring of the Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico in April and May. The international team was led by researchers from The University of Texas at Austin and Imperial College London. The findings validate the theory that violent asteroid impacts cause a planet's surface to behave like a fluid, said study author Sean Gulick, a research professor at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, a unit of the Jackson School of Geosciences. The research puts a definitive end to an alternative explanation that suggested that such impacts, which are common on other planets and moons, deform the surface by melting most of the rock around the impact. The findings are important for our understanding of this and other planets, Gulick said, because researchers found that the peak ring -- the mountain or hills around the impact -- consists of rock that comes from deep in the crust. It is the same exact kind of feature that we see on all large impacts on rocky planets, whether it be on Venus, on Mercury or on the moon, said Gulick, who was the expedition's co-principal investigator. They're a ubiquitous feature. Yet, prior to this drilling, we did not know how they were formed or what they were made of. What you're actually seeing is a window into the crust kilometers down. The team took core samples of the peak ring, which is now covered by water and the limestone of the modern gulf floor. They found that the asteroid, which hit with the force of 100 million atomic bombs, quickly opened a massive hole nearly 19 miles deep and 120 miles wide. Gulick said he knew they had solved the mystery of how large impacts affect the surface when the cores revealed an unmistakable pink granite, which is found deeper in the Earth, as opposed to the limestone that was present at the time of the impact. It was obvious and exhilarating, he said. That was the big find because it says the peak ring didn't come from something shallow. It came from something deep because it is made up of these buried crustal rocks that are now near the surface. Researchers found that the roughly 10-mile-wide Chicxulub asteroid, which hit in the Gulf of Mexico near the Yucatan Peninsula, pushed rock up from 6 miles below the surface to form the peak ring. Those rocks travelled approximately 20 miles in a few minutes, first being pushed outward from the impact, then rebounding upward above the Earth's surface and finally collapsing outward to form a ring of peaks around the center of the impact. The team also found that impacts appear to fundamentally lower the density and increase the porosity of rock. The granites found in the Chicxulub peak ring contained about 10 percent pore space, much greater than the 1 or 2 percent that scientists would expect, Gulick said. This finding could help explain why NASA's recent GRAIL mission showed the moon's crust -- which has been impacted multiple times -- has an unusually high porosity. These highly porous rocks may also provide a habitat for chemosynthetic life in the wake of impacts, researchers said, by providing places where simple organisms can take hold. There could also be nutrients available within the pores from circulating water that would have been heated by the impact event. Early Earth was constantly bombarded by asteroids, and the team has inferred that this bombardment must have created rocks with similar physical properties, which may partly explain how life took hold on Earth. Future studies will examine this theory. It is hard to believe that the same forces that destroyed the dinosaurs may have also played a part much earlier on in Earth's history by providing the first refuges for early life on the planet, said lead author Joanna Morgan, a professor at Imperial College London and the expedition's co-principal investigator. We are hoping that further analyses of the core samples will provide more insights into how life can exist in these subterranean environments. The expedition was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) and was supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). The Yucatan Government, Mexican federal government agencies and scientists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the Yucatan Center for Scientific Research (CICY) also supported the expedition."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":811,"title":"Notes from Mars 160: The Science Work We're Doing","class":1,"body":"The Mars Society is conducting the ambitious two-phase Mars 160 Twin Desert-Arctic Analogue mission to study how seven crewmembers could live, work and perform science on a true mission to Mars. Mars 160 crewmember Annalea Beattie is chronicling the mission, which will spend 80 days at the Mars Desert Research Station in southern Utah desert before venturing far north to Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station on Devon Island, Canada in summer 2017. Here's her eighth dispatch from the mission: If we find life on Mars, it will either be microbial or fossilized and living under extreme conditions. The huge diversity of microbes on Earth and their long evolutionary history make them excellent candidates for Earthly models of Martian life. For this reason, many studies of microbial life on Mars analogue sites here on Earth are focused on the extremophiles or those microbes that live in areas where conditions are extreme, in terms of temperature or chemical composition. Mars 160 is a twin desert study in a Mars analogue setting with the goal of characterizing life in extreme environments, advancing the understanding of the limits and constraints on life and defining protocols for future successful planetary scientific exploration. On our mission, field science team members carry out field and lab work as part of a multidisciplinary crew at an analogue planetary habitat, while simulating a crew on Mars. [See more Mars 160 photos here, and get daily images by the Mars 160 crew] This week I'd like to introduce you to our crew science team and talk about the science return as well as mention the science operations for the Mars 160 mission. Ecologist Shannon Rupert, our Mars 160 principal investigator, coordinates the science program for the whole expedition. For her, there are two main goals for the mission.  The first is to look for life in extreme environments by examining patterns of biodiversity and distribution of organisms within geologic microhabitats here on Earth that we suspect have analogues on Mars.  Shannon told me, Since we do not know if there was — let alone if there still is — life on Mars, our work centers on having value as Earth-based biological research, while when done in sim can also be used to determine field protocols and exploration strategies that are applicable for future planetary science missions. The lichen work we are doing for this mission is an excellent example of this, and has the added benefit of demonstrating our approach to the microbial work we are doing in a way that people can visualize and more easily understand. The second goal is to engage a team of Earth-based experts in collaboration with the (analogue) Mars-based crew, because, while there are a limited number of scientists who will be the actual astronauts on a Mars mission, there are many scientists on Earth who could contribute to the success of the science. Shannon suggests that current thinking is that astronauts on a human mission to Mars or another planet will be science generalists, and an integrated part of science operations will be for these generalists to work in tandem with the scientists in the field and also fully participate in the collaboration done with science backrooms on Earth. On this mission, Dr. Jon Clarke is our geologist and EVA (extravehicular activity) coordinator. He says that past environments on Earth and Mars are often different to those of the present day. Geology provides the historical perspective of changing environments over time and the context to the samples with data on soil texture, pH, salinity, geomorphic position, aspects and rock type. Without such detailed information, we will not understand many of the factors that potentially control biodiversity and distribution, both past and present. Geological data is a component to every aspect of what we will do on Mars — choosing landing sites, planning safe traverses, managing environmental hazards and locating potential resources — and also provides the basic context and many of the tools required in the search for Martian life. [The Search for Life on Mars (A Photo Timeline)] Until physical samples from Mars can be returned to Earth, in-situ spectral analysis is the main way that scientists can examine the chemical composition of Martian rocks. Understanding what the spectroscopic signatures of Martian rocks can tell us relies on recognizing similar signatures from analogous rocks on Earth that have well-established chemical compositions and formational histories. The spectral properties of rock samples collected during both halves of Mars 160 will be analysed at the University of Arkansas under the supervision of Paul Knightly, who will join our crew in the second phase of the mission. The purpose of analyzing these samples is to better understand the connection between surface features on Mars and their analogues on Earth. Paul Knightly's own research will focus on data-logging equipment to monitor how the ground surface changes over three months.studying the patterned ground and other permafrost features near the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) in the Canadian Arctic, where the second half of the Mars 160 project will take place next summer. In terms of biology, Anushree Srivastava, our biologist, has great responsibility on our team. As a Mars-based astronaut-scientist, she is working astrobiological projects that include the biodiversity of hardy lichens, the physical ecology and abundance of hypoliths, investigations of the patterns of halophilic (salt-loving) microbial diversity in the soil and the sampling of ancient evaporites of Mars analogues. Anushree says, We are exploring the parameters that affect the survival of organisms in the Mars-like conditions. In particular, the halophile research is the principal focus of the Mars 160 science mission. The search for microbial life on Mars is invigorated by the fact that different robotic missions to Mars corroborate the assumption that Mars was warmer and wetter in its distant past and in turn, conducive to life. Scientists have detected chloride salts or evaporate deposits on the surface of Mars using data from a variety of NASA spacecraft — the Opportunity rover, the Mars Odyssey and Mars Global Surveyor orbiters and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. These data provide strong evidence of the presence of brines on ancient Mars when conditions were optimal for life. [Ancient Mars Could Have Supported Life (Video)] Anushree is hopeful that life exists on Mars and says, Since ancient Mars had an atmosphere that was more suitable for life, any microbes living in the brine might be trapped inside the fluid inclusions of evaporate deposits, potentially halite and gypsum, when the atmosphere deteriorated and salty water crystalized via evaporation. Thus, any endeavor of detection of life in the similar microhabitats of terrestrial ancient evaporates can tell us heaps about the possibility of finding salt-loving life on Mars! Anushree is also involved in cross-training our crewmembers who perform field work during EVAs and laboratory work. A key challenge for all our work is the fact that the science work in the field is completed in simulation. Along with the maximum science return, the goal of Mars 160 is to identify and verify the most effective operational methods to use in order to improve scientific exploration and study of a planetary surface. The end result will be to codify processes best suited to the search for life both from a scientific perspective and with collaboration between Earth-based scientists and astronauts on Mars. Here at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah, field and lab work is done in collaboration with a remote science team via asynchronous communication. A team located offsite is part of the simulation and identifies challenges and documents not only the science but also what is effective in terms of methodologies for future planetary exploration. The role of Earth-based experts is to support our Mars-based crew. No other mission here at MDRS has ever had access to such a team of experts from institutions all over the world — in Canada, Spain, the U.K. and Australia, for example. Our Earth-based experts include Dr. Chris McKay and Dr. Kathy Bywaters of NASA's Ames Research Center in California and Paul Sokoloff from the Canadian Museum of Nature. Geologist Paul Knightly says astronauts on Mars will ultimately make decisions on what data or samples they collect, and that is a huge responsibility to carry. Data and samples returned from a mission to Mars will be studied for decades after the mission has ended by scientists on Earth, so it is essential that the data collection objectives prior to and during the mission are made clear. Teams on Earth must also retain enough flexibility to refine objectives when taking into consideration new information gathered by astronauts in order maximize the science return of the mission. For instance, our lichen specialist, Paul Sokoloff, gives regular advice with regard to modifying lichen protocols, according to changing circumstances. One of the aims of our mission is to address the challenges of a cross-trained crew and their ability to perform the necessary science field and lab work without being experts in that field. Shannon Rupert runs an integrated mission and believes in the power of science generalists. A generalist scientist is someone who can stand in for the expert. EMBED AS 02 IMAGE: anu-anastasiya-lab Anastasiya Stepanova has been cross-trained to work with hypolith sampling, and she will work with Anushree in the new laboratory. She says that in future Mars colonization efforts, astronauts will need multiple skills. Anastasiya has a background in journalism and is studying engineering. She has never encountered field work before and says it's a great test to see how fast you can catch on to what needs to be done. Together the hypoliths science team members (including me) lay down quadrats, collect data and process samples back in the laboratory for macroscopic measurements, characterizing physical ecology, accounting for the soil, the extent of colonization and percent abundance — in particular, desert experimental sites. DNA analysis will follow. We will use the MinION instrument to identify species, telling us about the nature of the organisms themselves and what makes them adapt to their environment. Yusuke Murakami, a geophysicist with the 50th Japanese Antarctic Expedition (2008-10), has been crossed-trained in lichens. This means he is able to scout, sample and use the tools needed from the Geophysical Survey to understand the three-dimensional context of the landscape. In terms of navigation, he takes care of safety so that Anushree is able to focus on her research. Yusuke is also trained in the protocols of laboratory work. He says, We can't be everything by ourselves. We need three Anushrees for biology. At the same time, each person who comes to the role brings another perspective, whether they are engineer or architect or artist. There is a joy of sharing the knowledge that is productive and benefits everyone. Shannon Rupert says that this mission is the first time she has seen the generalist and the scientist do the same job in the same site. For her, it's textbook EVA. [Gallery: The Most Memorable Spacewalks in History] Next year, our team will spend a further 80 days in the Arctic at Flashline Mars in the Canadian summer. Though the Utah desert and the Arctic are two different extreme environments, the science objectives will be the same as here. Both are Martian analogues, so we will learn about the comparative relevance of Martian astrobiological exploration from a biological point of view and a geological point of view. At the same time, what we have learned from this phase of the mission we can apply to the next. As for me: I'm the field artist for this expedition, and I'm testing out the relevance of geological field drawing in the spacesuit in a series of experiments that focus on how we gather data during the science EVAs. I'm thinking about the tools, techniques and strategies we use to understand the geology and the biology, as part of the science operations EVA project. Even by the end of our first phase of this mission, I will have spent more time drawing in a spacesuit on a science field trip than anyone, alive or dead — something my mother could never have predicted. More later on this enticing topic."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":812,"title":"Over 9,000 Women In Science Rally To Fight Hate Given Voice Following US Election","class":1,"body":"Among the many threads of rage that the President-elect has spewed over the last year and a half, a lot of his hatred has been directed at women. As we’ve reported here as often as necessary, he’s also a profoundly anti-scientific president-in-waiting. Plenty of women in science are understandably concerned with all this. A group of female scientists drafted an open letter, declaring that they will resist and fight against any such discrimination towards them and any minorities – working in their field, or outside of it. Science is foundational in a progressive society, fuels innovation, and touches the lives of every person on this planet, the letter reads. The anti-knowledge and anti-science sentiments expressed repeatedly during the U.S. presidential election threaten the very foundations of our society. Our work as scientists and our values as human beings are under attack. Far from being just a statement of solidarity, however, the letter reads more like a manifesto, or a call for action. They intend to identify key areas in science where discrimination against women and minorities is particularly rife. They aim to support the education and careers of all scientists, while encouraging collaboration, not divisiveness. They aim to target structural inequality at its root, and to make those in power more aware than ever of the system’s failings. They declare that they will use every day as an opportunity to demonstrate to young girls and women that they are welcome and needed in science. Their initial target, set on November 17, was to get 500 signatories. At the time of writing, they have over 9,000 from all across the world. Writing to Scientific American to explain their letter, the writers – Jane Zelikova, Theresa Jedd, Teresa Bilinski, Jessica Metcalf and Kelly Ramirez – explain that in the wake of Trump’s ascent, they just felt like they had to do something. There is already a well-documented and pervasive problem of discrimination of women and minorities in the sciences, and they are now certain that things are about to get worse. Lest we forget that Trump is someone who, at best, thinks that there are enough STEM programs around already. At his worst, he boasts of sexual assault and is poised to head the most anti-intellectual administration in modern history. We are members of racial, ethnic, and religious minority groups. We are immigrants. We are people with disabilities. We are LBGTQIA, they write. We are scientists. We are women. The motto of the US is E pluribus unum, which means out of many, [we are] one. This open letter is a beautiful, moving example of this sentiment, and it’s needed more now than ever. If you are a woman involved in science, click here and sign that letter."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":813,"title":"Better Questions to Ask Your Data Scientists","class":1,"body":"The intersection of big data and business is growing daily. Although enterprises have been studying analytics for decades, data science is a relatively new capability. And interacting in a new data-driven culture can be difficult, particularly for those who aren’t data experts. One particular challenge that many of these individuals face is how to request new data or analytics from data scientists. They don’t know the right questions to ask, the correct terms to use, or the range of factors to consider to get the information they need. In the end, analysts are left uncertain about how to proceed, and managers are frustrated when the information they get isn’t what they intended. At The Data Incubator, we work with hundreds of companies looking to hire data scientists and data engineers or enroll their employees in our corporate training programs. We often field questions from our hiring and training clients about how to interact with their data experts. While it’s impossible to give an exhaustive account, here are some important factors to think about when communicating with data scientists, particularly as you begin a data search. What question should we ask? As you begin working with your data analysts, be clear about what you hope to achieve. Think about the business impact you want the data to have and the company’s ability to act on that information. By hearing what you hope to gain from their assistance, the data scientist can collaborate with you to define the right set of questions to answer and better understand exactly what information to seek. Even the subtlest ambiguity can have major implications. For example, advertising managers may ask analysts, What is the most efficient way to use ads to increase sales? Though this seems reasonable, it may not be the right question since the ultimate objective of most firms isn’t to increase sales, but to maximize profit. Research from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising shows that using ads to reduce price sensitivity is typically twice as profitable as trying to increase sales. The value of the insight obtained will depend heavily on the question asked. Be as specific and actionable as possible. What data do we need? As you define the right question and objectives for analysis, you and your data scientist should assess the availability of the data. Ask if someone has already collected the relevant data and performed analysis. The ever-growing breadth of public data often provides easily accessible answers to common questions. Cerner, a supplier of health care IT solutions, uses data sets from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to supplement their own data. iMedicare uses information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to select policies. Consider whether public data could be used toward your problem as well. You can also work with other analysts in the organization to determine if the data has previously been analyzed for similar reasons by others internally. Then, assess whether the available data is sufficient. Data may not contain all the relevant information needed to answer your questions. It may also be influenced by latent factors that can be difficult to recognize. Consider the vintage effect in private lending data: Even seemingly identical loans typically perform very differently based on the time of issuance, despite the fact they may have had identical data at that time. The effect comes from fluctuations in the underlying underwriting standards at issuance, information that is not typically represented in loan data. You should also inquire if the data is unbiased, since sample size alone is not sufficient to guarantee its validity. Finally, ask if the data scientist has enough data to answer the question. By identifying what information is needed, you can help data scientists plan better analyses going forward. How do we obtain the data? If more information is needed, data scientists must decide between using data compiled by the company through the normal course of business, such as through observational studies, and collecting new data through experiments. As part of your conversation with analysts, ask about the costs and benefits of these options. Observational studies may be easier and less expensive to arrange since they do not require direct interaction with subjects, for example, but they are typically far less reliable than experiments because they are only able to establish correlation, not causation. Experiments allow substantially more control and provide more reliable information about causality, but they are often expensive and difficult to perform. Even seemingly harmless experiments may carry ethical or social implications with real financial consequences. Facebook, for example, faced public fury over its manipulation of its own newsfeed to test how emotions spread on social media. Though the experiments were completely legal, many users resented being unwitting participants in Facebook’s experiments. Managers must think beyond the data and consider the greater brand repercussions of data collection and work with data scientists to understand these consequences. Before investing resources in new analysis, validate that the company can use the insights derived from it in a productive and meaningful way. This may entail integration with existing technology projects, providing new data to automated systems, and establishing new processes. Is the data clean and easy to analyze? In general, data comes in two forms: structured and unstructured. Structured data is structured, as its name implies, and easy to add to a database. Most analysts find it easier and faster to manipulate. Unstructured data is often free form and cannot be as easily stored in the types of relational databases most commonly used in enterprises. While unstructured data is estimated to make up 95% of the world’s data, according to a report by professors Amir Gandomi and Murtaza Haider of Ryerson University, for many large companies, storing and manipulating unstructured data may require a significant investment of resources to extract necessary information. Working with your data scientists, evaluate the additional costs of using unstructured data when defining your initial objectives. Even if the data is structured it still may need to be cleaned or checked for incompleteness and inaccuracies. When possible, encourage analysts to use clean data first. Otherwise, they will have to waste valuable time and resources identifying and correcting inaccurate records. A 2014 survey conducted by Ascend2, a marketing research company, found that nearly 54% of respondents complained that a lack of data quality/completeness was their most prominent impediment. By searching for clean data, you can avoid significant problems and loss of time. Is the model too complicated? Statistical techniques and open-source tools to analyze data abound, but simplicity is often the best choice. More complex and flexible tools expose themselves to overfitting and can take more time to develop. Work with your data scientists to identify the simpler techniques and tools and move to more complex models only if the simpler ones prove insufficient. It is important to observe the KISS rule: Keep It Simple, Stupid! It may not be possible to avoid all of the expenses and issues related to data collection and analysis. But you can take steps to mitigate these costs and risks. By asking the right questions of your analysts, you can ensure proper collaboration and get the information you need to move forward confidently."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":814,"title":"Is AI around the corner? Scientists close to creating LIVING COMPUTER with ‘HUMAN BRAIN’","class":1,"body":"COMPUTER scientists attempting to electronically replicate the human brain are close to creating a 'living PC'. Engineers at the University of Massachusetts are developing microprocessors which mimic biological synapses - the nerve cells which pass messages across the human body. The science fiction-style project is being undertaken by Joshua Yang and Qiangfei Xia, professors of electrical and computer engineering at the US college. Their work focuses heavily on memristors - a computer component which could change science forever, switching the focus from electronics to ionics. Ionics, unlike electronics, is not dependent on a power source. It essentially has a memory, so even if it loses power it can remember what it was doing before and continue the action. This means computers of the near-future will be able to shut on and off like a lightbulb, not losing any data or files in the process. Different researchers and developers, including Mr Yang and Mr Xia, are now racing to be the first to harness this technology and use it to create a new generation of computers. Professor Jennifer Rupp said: I think there is a race going on. There is a strong driving force, but at the same time it's very important that there are players like HP, because they want to get to the market, show everyone that this is real. Mr Yang and Mr Xia explained the process in more detail in their report, explaining the process behind neuromorphic computing - computers which mimic humans. They said: Memristors have become a leading candidate to enable neuromorphic computing by reproducing the functions in biological synapses and neurons in a neural network system, while providing advantages in energy and size. This work opens a new avenue of neuromorphic computing hardware based on memristors. Specifically, we developed a diffusive-type memristor where diffusion of atoms offers a similar dynamics and the needed time-scales as its bio-counterpart, leading to a more faithful emulation of actual synapses, i.e. a true synaptic emulator."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":815,"title":"Hype Is Ahead Of Science For Campbell's-Backed Personalized Diet Startup Habit","class":1,"body":"mong the more noteworthy of recent news where diet, health, and business converge is the large investment by Campbell Soup in a start-up food company promising customized nutrition. The company, called Habit, has garnered not only Campbell’s sizable cash infusion (over $30 million), but also widespread media attention in response to its claim that dietary prescriptions for weight loss and health promotion can be personalized based on cutting edge science. The company’s founder and CEO has been quoted as saying it is just common sense to reject the idea that we all need the same food. With all due respect to the promise in these promises, and there genuinely may be some, neither science nor sense provides an unqualified endorsement. Let’s start with sense, since an appreciation for it, if not its application, is the more common. What does sense say about dietary customization? Looking at the world from just a bit of altitude, sense seems to suggest that creatures of the same species do, indeed, need substantially the same food. Zookeepers, for instance, rely almost entirely on sense to feed their diverse charges. Sense, not randomized trials, tells zookeepers, and the rest of us for that matter, that the lions are apt to do well with some kind of meat, the sea lions should get fish, and the koalas will manage as only koalas can on eucalyptus leaves. No doubt, there is metabolic and genetic diversity among individual lions of land and sea, as well as koalas, to say nothing of gibbons, tapirs, and iguanas. But when it comes time to feed these or any other creatures in our care, we look right past those minor differences and feed them the fare that suits the species. Common sense, it seems, argues after all for feeding much the same food to the same kind of animal. That just leaves one challenge to sense: are humans fundamentally different? Do our individual differences, in a departure from all the rest of biology, matter more than our phylogenetic family ties? To the best of my knowledge, the answer is a resounding no. We are an extraordinarily adaptive species, and by dispersing to the far reaches of the planet and adapting, in some cases over generations, centuries, and perhaps even millennia to diverse circumstances, we certainly demonstrate true biologic distinctions. Some of us, for instance, are constitutionally intolerant of lactose because we stop making the enzyme that digests it in infancy. Others of us, with ancestors who faced a digest dairy or die dilemma, are beneficiaries of the genetic response of the survivors, and remain capable of breaking down lactose throughout life. There are many other such examples, some of which are just now coming to our attention. But this human distinction is clearly one of degree, not kind, and modest degree at that. We are a species. The fundamentals of the dietary pattern to which we are adapted, and on which we thrive, are indeed common to us all. There are, to be sure, variations on the theme of feeding Homo sapiens well- but the theme is the stuff of massively convergent evidence from diverse populations around the globe, and simply isn’t negotiable. What, then of the science of dietary customization? The Habit website is still rather vague, but indicates that personalization is based on nutritional biomarkers, and your DNA. The latter indicates that this is an exercise in nutrigenomics. The potential of nutrigenomics- matching diet to specific genes- is intriguing. But we are in an age of questions far more than answers. There is a small number of what are called SNPs, standing for single nucleotide polymorphisms, reliably associated with metabolic differences relevant to digestion, and diet. But the number of relevant SNPs is vastly greater than the number we know. What, exactly, any given combination of SNPs means about responses to varied diets is as yet a matter more of conjecture than evidence. And all of this ignores the robust potency of epigenetics, the capacity to change gene behavior with diet (among other exposures) – rather than adapting diet to some fixed panel of genes. We will, certainly, learn more about variation in genetic predisposition relevant to diet. As we do, the capacity to personalize dietary prescriptions will evolve. But that personalization will always, at best, be a thin layer of metaphorical icing. The well-baked cake of food good for Homo sapiens is, and will remain, common to us all. Vegetables and fruits are good for us; Coca Cola is not. So it is; and so it shall be. The fascination with customization, then, is a product of neither science, nor sense- but rather a fad, born from a blend of arrogance, and opportunism. It is arrogant for Homo sapiens to think we are a departure from all the rest of nature; that we, uniquely, need diets unique to each one of us. It is opportunistic of business to exploit this predilection to sell us just what we think we want. The full range of services offered by Habit may confer some good, if only by offering convenience rather than truly scientific customization. Perhaps there will be some of both. Either way, I wish them well, and look on with interest. But before you reach for your credit card, you may want to consider how reliably marketing gets ahead of science, and how distressingly uncommon applications of common sense tend to be. Apply yours, and it’s apt to direct you here: the most reliable of habits where diet and business opportunity commingle is…hype."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":816,"title":"3D embryo atlas reveals human development in unprecedented detail","class":1,"body":"Digital model will aid vital research, offering chance chance to explore intricate changes occurring in the first weeks of life The beautiful and otherworldly development of the human embryo has been revealed in unprecedented detail in an interactive three-dimensional atlas. The digital models, built by a team of scientists in the Netherlands, took around 45,000 hours to produce and offer researchers an unparalleled glimpse into the first eight weeks of human development. Everyone thinks we already know this, but I believe we know more about the moon than about our own development, said Bernadette de Bakker, of the University of Amsterdam, who co-led the project with colleague Professor Antoon Moorman. As de Bakker pointed out, many textbook depictions of embryo development are based on observations made many decades ago, and often contain details inferred from studies on mouse or chick embryos. By contrast, the new resource will offer researchers the chance to explore the intricate changes occurring in the first weeks of life from a series of human specimens, aiding vital research. It is important to understand normal human embryology to clarify how inborn defects and congenital malformations occur, said de Bakker. Published in the journal Science and available for all to view on a special website, the research involved the painstaking construction of 3D digital models of human embryos at various stages during the first two months of development. Around 75 trained students were involved in analysing digital photographs of approximately 15,000 stained sections of tissues from the US-based Carnegie Collection of embryos – an array dating from around 60 to more than 100 years ago, collected by doctors during procedures such as hysterectomies. For each section, organs and tissues had to be carefully labelled in order to build up the digital atlas. If you look at one section, you have to draw a line around the liver, you have to draw a line around the kidneys, draw lines around the nerves, the blood vessels – and that is done manually by a digital pen and tablet, said de Bakker, adding that up to 1,000 sections were manually analysed for each embryo, with as many as 150 organs and structures identified. In total, sections from 34 embryos were analysed, two for each of 17 different stages of development. The resulting atlas is currently composed of interactive, 3D models of 14 of the embryos, each corresponding to a different stage within the first two months of development. Using the tool, scientists can explore the development and changing position of different organs, as well as structures such as the skeleton or nervous system, rotate the embryo and select features of interest. Also available to view are the digital photographs of the sections used to produce the models, as well as detailed figures and tables of data containing unprecedented information on how each organ grows and changes over time. The work has already yielded new insights. We discovered that some organs in humans develop [far] earlier than they first arrive in chick or mouse embryos and some [develop far] later, said de Bakker. That, she says, is important for areas such as developmental toxicology, where mouse or chick embryos are used as model organisms to explore the impact of various drugs or other chemicals. Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, professor of mammalian development and stem cell biology at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the research, said that the new atlas would be extremely helpful to researchers. It is a beautifully careful assessment of development through analysis of material with limited availability. It will provide an invaluable atlas to guide future study, she said. But, Zernicka-Goetz added, the project was a dramatic reminder of how little is known about human embryology. The dearth of knowledge, she says, is down to barriers in experimental study, reiterating recent calls for a debate on the current limits on human embryo culture – an issue which came to the fore following an announcement earlier this year that Zernicka-Goetz and colleagues had broken the record for growing human embryos in the lab. Currently, the widely accepted limit for human embryo culture is 14 days or in other words immediately prior to gastrulation said Zernicka-Goetz. Given our great ignorance of the mechanisms of human development through these stages and the great value to be gained for the understanding and treatment of developmental diseases and for stem cell biology, there is a strong scientific argument for more discussion about the possibility of extending this limit."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":817,"title":"Your dog remembers more than you think","class":1,"body":"At last, scientists may have an answer to a question every dog owner asks: Does your pet remember the things you do together? For people, at least, the ability to consciously recall personal experiences and events is thought to be linked to self-awareness. It shapes how we think about the past—and how we predict the future. Now, a new study suggests that dogs also have this type of memory, indicating that the talent may be more common in other animals than previously recognized. The study, is a creative approach to trying to capture what’s on a dog’s mind, says Alexandra Horowitz, a dog cognition scientist at Barnard College in New York City who was not involved in the research. The idea that nonhuman animals can consciously remember things they’ve done or witnessed in the past, called episodic memory, is controversial—largely because it’s thought that these animals aren’t self-aware. But scientists have shown that species like Western scrub jays, hummingbirds, rats, and the great apes—those that have to recall complex sequences of information in order to survive—have episodiclike memory. For instance, the jays remember what food they’ve hidden, where they stashed it, when they did so, and who was watching while they did it. But what about recalling things that aren’t strictly necessary for survival, or someone else’s actions? To find out whether dogs can remember such details, scientists asked 17 owners to teach their pets a trick called do as I do. The dogs learned, for instance, that after watching their owner jump in the air, they should do the same when commanded to do it!  But that alone doesn’t prove episodiclike memory, says Claudia Fugazza, an ethologist at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, and the study’s lead author. You have to test them when they don’t expect it. So in the next round of training, the owners taught their dogs to lie down after watching them do something like touching an open umbrella or stepping up on a chair. They were no longer required to imitate. And then we surprised them, Fugazza says. Again, an owner performed an action, but this time after the dog laid down, the owner ordered, Do it! The dog then had to recall what it had seen its owner do, even though it had no expectation that it needed to remember the action. The dogs were tested in this way both 1 minute and 1 hour after watching their owners. The dogs succeeded in 33 of 35 trials. That suggests that dogs have something similar to episodic memory, Fugazza and her team report today in Current Biology. But the longer the canines wait, the more trouble they have recalling the action. That’s similar to human episodic memory, which decays at a faster rate when an event isn’t intentionally recorded, the researchers say. For instance, you’re more likely to remember your first kiss than a hug last week from your spouse. It shows that our dogs remember events much like we do, and [it] blows out of the water the old way that most scientists would characterize animal memory, says Brian Hare, a dog cognition expert at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, who was not involved in the study. Our dogs’ memories aren’t based simply on repetition and reward. Discovering that this type of memory is not unique to humans means it did not evolve only in primates, but is a more widespread skill in the animal kingdom, Fugazza says. Indeed, parrots, dolphins, and killer whales could be the next ones to be tested, because other researchers have already taught these species to do as I do. Most likely, they remember more than we think."}

{"id":819,"title":"From Raw Data to Data Science: Adding Structure to Unstructured Data to Support Product Development","class":1,"body":"Data science is fast becoming a critical skill for developers and managers across industries, and it looks like a lot of fun as well. But it’s pretty complicated - there are a lot of engineering and analytical options to navigate, and it’s hard to know if you’re doing it right or where the bear traps lie. In this series we explore ways of making sense of data science - understanding where it’s needed and where it’s not, and how to make it an asset for you, from people who’ve been there and done it. This InfoQ article is part of the series Getting A Handle on Data Science . You can subscribe to receive notifications via RSS. Key takeaways Levels of data structure can exist on a scale from unstructured raw machine logs to analysis specific data tables, which are highly structured and designed to inform specific and currently relevant information needs. As we move away from raw unstructured data, the volume and variety of it will decrease and as such so does the skill set needed to manipulate it, the time needed to prepare it before analysing it, and the attention from business users to assess the value of it. Before doing any data modelling or developing data pipelines, it’s useful to analyse the unstructured data and provide insight into a real business problem or two. To add structure to unstructured data, we can look in three areas: the real-life human behaviour behind the data, any meta data we have about the user whose behaviour it is, and the inherent structure of the technology that is recording the behaviour. To implement this structure in data, first define signals, which are quantitative properties of the concept that help us to identify the presence and nature of it, and then we use the signals to distinguish between the values we’ve defined for our concept. Introduction With unstructured database technologies like Cassandra, MongoDB and even JSON storage in Postgres, unstructured data has become remarkably easy to store and to process. Software and data engineers alike can succeed in a world (mostly) free from data modelling, which is no longer a prerequisite to collecting data or extracting value from it. We can start collecting data from various sources and at large scale without knowing why we’re collecting it or what value it might have towards helping us to achieve our overall product development and business goals. For some readers, alarm bells will be ringing. Why collect data if you don’t know what its value is? After all, for the information manager spending months adding structure by gathering business requirements, modelling the data and simply surfacing it to business users has worked for decades. Other readers may have read the title and thought, Why add structure at all?. After all, for a data engineer the NoSQL revolution means that adding structure to data by modelling it for a relational data store is no longer a necessary requirement for most use cases. While there is a place for both of these concerns, the reality is that neither the information manager nor the leading edge data engineer would be entirely right either. The reality is that data will exist at varying levels of structure throughout our data ecosystems and in order to make the right decisions to define each level, we have to understand the costs and benefits of adding structure. The people costs of completely unstructured data ecosystems While the infrastructure costs of storing data is relatively immaterial, the people costs can increase exponentially with both data volumes and variety. With unstructured data, you will need more data engineers or new highly skilled analysts, versus traditional relational data stores, to make use of the data at all. For every new business need, analysts and business/product managers will have to spend time understanding the supply of data and how they might change their decisions based on it. After all, structured data is sort of a menu of data and unstructured data is more like a bulk size grocery store. Even if the analysts know their way around the data, for each (new) business question data engineering skills will have to be deployed in a potentially complex data preparation process, which every analyst knows requires a specific skill sets and is immensely time consuming, leaving less time for analysis and supporting decisions. In short, the people cost implications for unstructured data are that: A complete absence of structure leaves little room for company wide efficiency gains in the data preparation process, more time will be spent to answer each business question. Less room for regular support to the business from analysts without more advanced data engineering skills, meaning more expensive analysts will need to be attracted and retained. So a data ecosystem that relies completely on unstructured data would be a heavy burden on human resource indeed! This is both true in terms of hours spent in response to each business need, and in terms of skills you will need on staff in your business analyst teams. But what would happen if the data ecosystem relied on structured data only? The time costs of completely structured data ecosystems In the traditional information management funnel, we would start by collecting requirements, defining a target schema (i.e. what should structure of the data look like) and developing pipelines from source to schema. Whether or not to introduce new data into decisions is hardly an isolated process. Time is spent preparing test data, evaluating it and forming consensus about whether it should find its way into routine decision making. All of this is usually done away from the immediate data needs of the business (i.e. not a live business case, but a historical or hypothetical one). In a fully structured data ecosystem, all data sets must be understood and modelled before they are introduced into business decision making. If that work is required before the data can be used, then no data department will be able to keep up with the growing supply of and demand for data by its business users. Data that is absolutely essential to informing decisions about the present and future course of our business could be stuck in an information management pipeline before it gets in the hands of a data analyst providing decision support, never mind before it finds its way into the decision-making and actions of a business manager! So while a traditional information manager may prefer to bring data through the IM funnel which has worked so well for 20 years, they will never succeed in making data a source of competitive advantage. The development time for structured data stores will be too long and will require too much distraction from data and business resources. So we want to design our data ecosystems to balance the agility and low cost per kb storage associated with NoSQL solutions and the efficiency gains and lower cost analysts associated with adding structure via the IM funnel. The business benefits of structure People have a natural tendency to organise around information and as such, a business needs a vast amount of structure to its information in order to achieve that structure in its operations. For example, providing a common view of business performance helps everyone to organise around common objectives (i.e. less debating about what good performance is or how to measure it and more debates about how to improve performance in specific areas). Structure such as key performance indicators, standardised user/business/product metrics and even generic consumer behaviour data stores have an essential role to play in a helping a business communicate and stay on target. Not only that, but structured data can also support communities of practice amongst your analysts. Since analysts have to operationalise each business concept to be scientific, establishing a common language and common operational definitions in your data is often essential for organisations with distributed data analysis teams. Analysts can then share insights and techniques, rather than debating how to translate common business concepts into data objects. More generally, structure is a systematic way of collecting information about a specific real life phenomena or area. It’s a precise set of need requirements for that phenomena and to enforce a structure is to say to any system trying to insert data about this phenomena, you need to have the following information (i.e. data objects), which in turn has to have the following properties (i.e. data types). Striking balance So while modern day data engineers and scientists may prefer a world without structure, overall if an organisation wants to embrace data into its decision making it must also embrace structure onto its data. And so we must find balance: balance between the agility and storage (cost per kb) benefits associated with NoSQL solutions and the efficiency gains in data preparation, the lower cost of business analysts and most importantly the unavoidable need for structure that makes data a common source of value in an organisation. To do this we must define a data management funnel, whose purpose is neither to proliferate unstructured data nor to lock data up in a length evaluation and structuring exercise. So what would that look like? Data management funnel The root problem underlying the tension between structure and unstructured data is a common problem between data management and software management; the need to build tangible products quickly, to explore their value and gain learnings about the strengths before significant investment. Data products could be any of the following: Unstructured data set for data scientists Structure data sets for data analysts A data set of model outputs (e.g. price elasticity coefficients) A self-service dashboard for business users or non-specialist analysts A data-enabled product or platform capability (e.g. trained neural network underlying recommendation engines) In the development of all of these products, more and more we see software management principles make their way into data science with great success. Using unstructured data and a minimum viable product style project, data teams can evaluate both the value of the data and the extent to which structure must be added in order to the value to be realised by non-specialist analysts. This is often done using live data to solve a real business challenge, unlike the IM funnel where historical or hypothetical needs are used to define the idealised schema. So what are the key questions we need to consider to adapt a product management style funnel to be a data management style funnel? Key questions to answer to define your DM funnel stages When does a data set get applied to a live business problem? When and how does the data itself get evaluated for its structural needs and value? When does structured data set get added to the production supply of data in your organization? While you may want to define more stages, effectively these following three stages follow the question areas that must addressed. Three stages of data maturity 1. Raw data: Massive volumes, entirely unstructured. Source: Usually comes directly from a machine (e.g. server logs, api outputs). Access: There is limited access to this data because of the skills to manipulate and analyse it or for privacy reasons. Typical audience: data engineers or data scientists using NoSQL queries or advanced processing using python. 2. Analysis Friendly data: Massive to medium volumes, partially structured or structured data. Source: data objects are calculated in an extract load transform style process from raw data to the tables or NoSQL collections, ideally organised by analysable units (e.g. a user based collection with everything we know about users). Access: Highly skilled analysts and data scientists only as the size and variety of formats in this data make it difficult to query. 3. Management Reporting data: Entirely structured. Source: calculated from either the raw data or the analysis friendly data sets and includes both the numbers that business/product managers use to run the business (e.g. KPIs) as well as any business drivers at an aggregate level (e.g. when companies report their financial growth they often report the drivers of price, volume, foreign exchange, acquisitions, etc). Access: Open as data security policy will allow. Typical audience: Business intelligence analysts or even self-service analysis with business/product managers. At each stage of the funnel, more business logic and terminology is added, and of course more structure is given to the data. Data objects become more predictable in both their format and their range of values and the types of analysis tools used to consume this data are increasingly hungry for relational database form. There are also governance and privacy concerns, as earlier stages are likely to contain personally identifiable and sensitive information than later stages. At each stage of the funnel you should ask yourself who has access to the data and what operations can they perform on it (although that subject is not addressed here). The first stage of the funnel is a land without law, mostly managed for cost per kb, usually only accessible by the central core of data capabilities. Systems and data engineers throw the data in there for exploration by others. Populating data at this stage is low effort and as such this area can get messy quickly! The final stage is the polar opposite, a land of highly governed high structured data, widely available (with the exception of market sensitive data in large publically listed companies). Business/product managers are using data to measure the performance of their decisions, and gain high level understanding of the drivers, and as such it's unlikely that by the time the data has reached this stage it isn’t narrowly defined by definition and variable type. The middle layer, where raw unstructured data is converted into something of partial structure and potentially high value, is the most important and also the most confusing. It’s this layer where balance is structure, communities of practice are serviced and deep insight into the behaviour of your consumers and the reason behind your performance can be discovered. To go from the first (raw data) layer to the second (analysis friendly) layer is daunting indeed! A single piece of unstructured raw data can populate an entire analysis friendly schema. For example, an image posted on Twitter can be broken into data objects for three separate SQL tables: Tweet Image pixels, with columns position_x, postition_y, red, green, blue Tweet, with columns post_text, datetime etc Tweet publisher, with columns account_name, followers, etc Potentially all of that information is relevant to make use of the tweet data. Rather than flushing out the rest of the nuisances of defining a funnel, the rest of this article will speak to those needing to make that first step away from the unstructured land without law and answer the question: where to begin with raw unstructured data? Using data in a raw unstructured format and applying it to real business challenge can be a more effective and efficient way to establish the desired structure of the data, than scoping out the data needs and defining a data schema from there anyways. Solving the challenges in this layer means unlocking the potential to observe, to understand, to predict and control various aspects of your business, especially consumer behaviour, and therefore it’s worth spending time and effort on. Clearly the potential value of this process outweighs the resource requirements, or else data scientists would be out of a job! So how can we can go from unstructured chaos to something of value to our organisations and an informed opinion about what structure is needed for that value to be repeated on a regular basis? Working with unstructured data The reality today is that it’s extremely difficult to know what the value of a data set is until it’s been analysed in the context of a real business challenge (past or present). Using data in a raw unstructured format and applying it to real business challenges can also be a more effective and efficient way to establish the ideal structure of the data, versus scoping out the data needs of business stakeholder and defining a data schema from there. So before doing any data modelling or developing data pipelines, try developing a MVDP (minimum viable data product) and provide insight into a real business problem or two. What are the common types of unstructured data suitable for an MVDP? Common types of unstructured data Web application data formats (e.g. JSON, HSTORE) Document file formats (e.g. HTML, XML, pdfs) Free form text (e.g. text from within a pdf, the text from a tweet or blog post) Images (e.g. jpg, png) GIS vector and raster (although there are databases with these variable types so I won’t count them as unstructured here) Most readers will be familiar with web application data and the process of parsing the data from that format into a structured SQL database. The ubiquitous need to transform JSON and other such inputs from web interfaces into fragmented entries in SQL databases underlies much of the motivation to develop the NoSQL solutions. Document file formats such as HTML and XMLs can be parsed with tools like Nokogiri. Most of the time, nearly all of a pdf is free form text (except document scans, of course). So of the common types listed above, images and free form text pose an industry-class problem for extracting value. When it comes to text and image analysis, the realm of possible tools for analysis is seemingly endless. Rather than advocating for a specific tool, we’re going to understand a specific process. The process involves: Structuring the business problem conceptually Implementing the full space of concepts into computable signals Using data science techniques to establish a mapping from the space of signals to a single structured concept that is relevant to the business problem Why bother with a process at all, why not just reference existing tools for text and images? Of course, when analysing images, a perfect image recognition solution would be fantastic. In such an ideal solution, you could apply a method contains_couch and it would return a yes, no, or even better a .png of just the couch, along with a hash of its properties, e.g. {colour: brown}. In that same ideal world, when analysing text, a perfect natural language processing solution would have a method is_sarcastic or contains. Political. opinion that would return a boolean answer or better yet, the text containing the sarcasm or reduced form of the political opinion itself. And we’d be done! Unstructured data to highly structured and specific business relevant variables. In my experience, we’re not quite there yet. We may be close, but we’re not quite there yet. Not everyone can install a python package or ruby gem, query the text or images with the methods described above and get a robust enough result to make decisions on. In the world between these ideal solutions and the raw data, anything that enhances your understanding, moves you towards better products for your user or better decisions for your business/product managers is helpful! Three places to look for structure conceptually in unstructured data Part of what underlies the explosion of investment in data is not necessarily that there’s so much of it, but instead that behind most data is a human behaviour intermediated by some piece of technology. What we’re really investing in is systems of observation and understanding into human behaviour, particularly as it pertains to our business. e’re going to use this basic idea to define our approach to adding structure to unstructured data. Three places to look for structure conceptually: 1. Meta data: Look for structure in the system of observation (i.e. technology) that created the data. All technology operates in a highly structured way; did the system leave a record of structure (e.g. css tags in an html or meta data in server logs)? 2. Data created by the user: Look for structure in the bespoke user interactions inherent in the software that created the data. Most software has unique and distinct interactions that translate to relevant structures when taken into context of that software. For example, a # doesn’t mean anything in general but on Twitter a hashtag is a functional mechanism that categorises the user created content by topic. It’s also used to tell jokes, e.g. #SorryNotSorry. Similarly, an @mention denotes an interaction between two people via their Twitter accounts. Are there unique features in the content created by users on your site or product? Do they correspond to distinct behaviours or concepts? A record of which of those features were used can provide a huge amount of structure to the behavioural state of the person at that time (e.g. location on the site, intended action from the site, interaction with others, etc). 3. Data about the users themselves: This is sometimes called properties of the root, and generally speaking refers to the object external to your system that causes a change in state of the system and at the same time creates the data. In the case of software users, the root is the person who interacted with the software. Once we have established a structured concept (in one of the three areas above or elsewhere), how can we implement this structure of the concept in the data? Steps two and 3 to add structure computationally First, we define signals. Signals are quantitative properties of the concept that help us to identify the presence and nature of the concept. They are not the concept itself. For example, if all couches were brown, then observing any shade of brown in an image would be one property that signals the presence of the couch. Second, we use the signals to distinguish between the different structured values we’ve defined for our concept by establishing the relationship between the signals we’ve computed and the structure of our concept. The relationship could be deterministic (e.g. contains_couch: TRUE or False) or probabilistic (e.g. contains_couch: 0.9). When the relationship between signals and concept is probabilistic, it’s usually because there isn’t enough information in the signals to define the structure of the concept uniquely. An image that contains the colour brown is a signal of an image with a brown couch, but there will be a chance that it contains a couch and a chance that it does not. For that reason, practitioners will define as many independent signals as is possible, given the unstructured data that they’re working with. In doing so they must strike a balance between three competing factors: the numbers of signals, the independence of those signals and the overall computational cost of computing the signals and the relationship (independence is particularly important since two signals that contribute the same information, e.g. % of image dark_brown and % of image light_brown, won’t improve your ability to identify your concept). To begin with, any quantitative property that corresponds with the concept could be helpful. If a signal is always present when the concept is present and never present when the concept is present, then it would be a perfect signal of concept presence. If furthermore variations in the signal always corresponded to variations in the concept (e.g. different colours of brown, for different colours of couch) then that signal can uniquely define your concept of the couch! In practice, an individual signal rarely reveals the concept as we wish to define it. Instead, it is very common that a large number of signals would be used to define a single concept. Hundreds of signals are used in search engines to produce the results for the search, even though you only type a handful of words. Defining signals is as much an art and leap of creative imagination as it is a science. On the other hand, once signals are defined, establishing how these signals distinguish between different states of your concept is more of a (data) science. To make it through this final step, the first consideration is what data structure will be best to enforce on the data representing your concept? For example, a binary concept such as contains_a_couch, is_political would be a method that takes the signals as inputs and outputs a boolean response. On the other hand, a concept such as text_topic_list would be a method that takes the signals and outputs an array of topics (they could be topic ids, if you have a denormalized master table for the topics themselves). With a set of signals and a target data structured for your concept, machine learning is high on the list of go-to tools to establish your mapping, but not always necessary. In the example below we use a neural network style classification method based on numerical signals to demonstrate how this could be done. Hello, World! In my grad school courses on machine learning and AI, chairs and couches were always the text-book examples. This is because a mundane concept like a chair turns out to be simple to structure conceptually, and therefore nice to explore mathematically, but hugely complex to implement in practice. In our example, the situation will be the opposite: the concepts are incredibly complex to structure in practice but they are idealised in such a way that makes them simple to structure using simple methods. For our example, we will be analysing the social media behaviour of a character called World. World is not a real person and the examples are heavily stylised to demonstrate the concepts we’ve discussed. The unstructured data will be a social media profile webpage in HTML format. The concept we’re going to use to add structure to this profile page is its Selfie-ish-ness, defined as a floating decimal representing the % of the images that are a selfie from World’s profile page. I’ll be using Ruby to demonstrate the methods with code, but they can be done in Python or any language that can process images as well."}

The rusty spotted cat, one of the few wild cats that inhabit the forests of Andhra Pradesh, is among the animals in the Eastern Ghats that need more research support. That is the message researchers are carrying to a forthcoming Emerging Wildlife Conservation Leaders (EWCL) meeting in Washington D.C. Reputed to be the smallest wild cat at about half the size of its domestic cousin, the rusty spotted species shares its habitat with the tiger. Both tigers and rusty spotted cats inhabit the Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve in Andhra Pradesh. The State is one of the few where wildlife enthusiasts can study both ends of the cat spectrum in the same sanctuary. Yet, while the tiger is closely monitored, little is known about the status of the rusty spotted cat (Prionailurus rubiginosus). The species has been recorded in India and Sri Lanka, but it has been sighted in Nepal also in recent times. Many wildlife experts describe it as the smallest cat species in the wild, though some some say the African black-footed cat qualifies for that status. The small Indian cat is listed as ‘Near Threatened’ on the IUCN Red List, but its health in the Eastern Ghats is not clear, says Murthy Kantimahanti, founder, Eastern Ghats Wild Life Society (EGWS) . While the cat is said to be present in all forests in the Eastern Ghats, no significant study has been done, he says. Mr. Murthy has been invited to the conservation meeting in Washington D.C where he would urge that more research is done on various wildlife species of the Eastern Ghats."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":821,"title":"The science of friction on graphene","class":1,"body":"Graphene, a two-dimensional form of carbon in sheets just one atom in thick, has been the subject of widespread research, in large part because of its unique combination of strength, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. But despite many years of study, some of graphene’s fundamental properties are still not well-understood, including the way it behaves when something slides along its surface. Now, using powerful computer simulations, researchers at MIT and elsewhere have made significant strides in understanding that process, including why the friction varies as the object sliding on it moves forward, instead of remaining constant as it does with most other known materials. The findings are presented this week in the journal Nature, in a paper by Ju Li, professor of nuclear science and engineering and of materials science and engineering at MIT, and seven others at MIT, the University of Pennsylvania, and universities in China and Germany. Graphite, a bulk material composed of many layers of graphene, is a well-known solid lubricant. (In other words, like oil, it can be added in between contacting materials to reduce friction.) Recent research suggests that even one or a few layers of graphene can also provide effective lubrication. This may be used in small-scale thermal and electrical contacts and other nanoscale devices. In such cases, an understanding of the friction between two pieces of graphene, or between graphene and another material, is important for maintaining a good electrical, thermal, and mechanical connection. Researchers had previously found that while one layer of graphene on a surface reduces friction, having a few more was even better. However, the reason for this was not well-explained before, Li says. There is this broad notion in tribology that friction depends on the true contact area, Li says — that is, the area where two materials are really in contact, down to the atomic level. The true contact area is often substantially smaller than it would otherwise appear to be if observed at larger size scales. Determining the true contact area is important for understanding not only the degree of friction between the pieces, but also other characteristics such as the electrical conduction or heat transfer. For example, explains co-author Robert Carpick of the University of Pennsylvania, When two parts in a machine make contact, like two teeth of steel gears, the actual amount of steel in contact is much smaller than it appears, because the gear teeth are rough, and contact only occurs at the topmost protruding points on the surfaces. If the surfaces were polished to be flatter so that twice as much area was in contact, the friction would then be twice as high. In other words, the friction force doubles if the true area of direct contact doubles. But it turns out that the situation is even more complex than scientists had thought. Li and his colleagues found that there are also other aspects of the contact that influence how friction force gets transferred across it. We call this the quality of contact, as opposed to the quantity of contact measured by the ‘true contact’ area, Li explains. Experimental observations had shown that when a nanoscale object slides along a single layer of graphene, the friction force actually increases at first, before eventually leveling off. This effect lessens and the leveled-off friction force decreases when sliding on more and more graphene sheets. This phenomenon was also seen in other layered materials including molybdenum disulfide. Previous attempts to explain this variation in friction, not seen in anything other than these two-dimensional materials, had fallen short. To determine the quality of contact, it is necessary to know the exact position of each atom on each of the two surfaces. The quality of contact depends on how well-aligned the atomic configurations are in the two surfaces in contact, and on the synchrony of these alignments. According to the computer simulations, these factors turned out to be more important than the traditional measure in explaining the materials’ frictional behavior, according to Li. You cannot explain the increase in friction as the material begins to slide by just the contact area, Li says. Most of the change in friction is actually due to change in the quality of contact, not the true contact area. The researchers found that the act of sliding causes graphene atoms to make better contact with the object sliding along it; this increase in the quality of contact leads to the increase in friction as sliding proceeds and eventually levels off. The effect is strong for a single layer of graphene because the graphene is so flexible that the atoms can move to locations of better contact with the tip. A number of factors can affect the quality of contact, including rigidity of the surfaces, slight curvatures, and gas molecules that get in between the two solid layers, Li says. But by understanding the way the process works, engineers can now take specific steps to alter that frictional behavior to match a particular intended use of the material. For example, prewrinkling of the graphene material can give it more flexibility and improve the quality of contact. We can use that to vary the friction by a factor of three, while the true contact area barely changes, he says. In other words, it’s not just the material itself that determines how it slides, but also its boundary condition — including whether it is loose and wrinkled or flat and stretched tight, he says. And these principles apply not just to graphene but also to other two-dimensional materials, such as molybdenum disulfide, boron nitride, or other single-atom or single-molecule-thick materials. Potentially, a moving mechanical contact could be used as a way to make very good power switches in small electronic devices, Li says. But that is still some ways off; while graphene is a promising material being widely studied, we’re still waiting to see graphene electronics and 2-D electronics take off. It’s an emerging field. Researchers have studied the unique frictional behavior of graphene for many years, but the complex mechanisms underlying these observations are still not fully understood, says Ashlie Martini, an associate professor of engineering at the University of California at Merced, who was not involved in this work. This paper tackles the challenge head on and provides new insights into the origins of friction on graphene that I anticipate will be applicable to two-dimensional materials in general. Martini adds: The authors of the paper correctly suggest that their work could be used as a foundation for ‘tuning’ friction on graphene. Actually implementing this tuning has the potential for significant impact, and an exciting next step based on this research would be to implement the proposed tuning as a first step toward controllable friction in scientific and engineering applications. Besides Li and Carpick, the research team included former MIT and University of Pennsylvania visiting student Suzhi Li, now a Humboldt Research Fellow in Germany; Qunyang Li at Tsinghua University in China; Xin Liu at the University of Pennsylvania and now at Intel; Peter Gumbsch at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany; and Xiangdong Ding and Jun Sun at Xi’an Jiaotong University in China.

{"id":822,"title":"‘Creation engineering’: The art and science of naming drugs","class":1,"body":"Yearly lists of the most popular baby names show how tastes change over time. While Jennifer, Heather, Michael and Jason may have been favorites in decades past, today’s top contenders include Emma, Olivia, Liam and Noah. The same applies to pharmaceutical drug names. Aspirin, for instance, was a name with legs in the early 20th century. Bayer branded its pain medication with this simple moniker in 1899 and sold it around the world for years. By the end of the century, though, drugs were named with a blockbuster edge and struck very different chords. The late 1990s was the era of Celebrex and Viagra as well as the now-infamous OxyContin. More recently, drugs have reached for even more exotic sounds. Within the past few years, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved Farydak for treating multiple myeloma, Avycaz for abdominal infections, Vraylar for schizophrenia, Idelvion for hemophilia, Luzu for athlete’s foot and Byvalson for high blood pressure. Saying these names aloud, some may hear a strange and lovely music, while others may imagine aliens arriving from distant planets. Similarly, naming a drug is a complicated process. The power of three A branded prescription drug is actually known by three names. The pharmaceutical company gives a new drug a chemical name based on a set of rules established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. For any drug that will be marketed in the United States, the next step is obtaining a name from United States Adopted Name Council. It assigns the active ingredient of the drug a generic name, which must be cleared and reviewed by the International Nonproprietary Name program run by the World Health Organization. This step assures that there is one non-proprietary (generic) name throughout the world for the drug, explained Stephanie C. Shubat, director of the Adopted Name Council. With the generic name settled, a pharmaceutical company proposes a brand name to the FDA, to mark the product as its own. For example, an antidepressant is known in the lab by its chemical name: N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-[4-(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]propan-1-amine. The generic name assigned to this complex chemical is fluoxetine. To the rest of us, the drug is commonly known as Prozac. Prozac is what I call the Big Bang of pharmaceutical naming. It came out of nowhere, it means absolutely nothing, and it really just said, ‘Wow, OK, this is blockbuster naming in the drug world,’  said Scott Piergrossi, vice president of creative development at the Brand Institute, which names, tests, markets or otherwise works on about 75% of FDA-approved names each year and about two-thirds of the global names. David Wood, a pioneer in the field of branding and founder of Wood Worldwide, named Prozac in the early 1990s, before he sold his shop to InterbrandHealth. Today, Prozac even appears in the Oxford English Dictionary. According to R. John Fidelino, executive creative director at Interbrand, it was the first drug name that took both a condition and its treatment out of the shadows. Prioritizing safety though each step of the naming process presents hurdles, approval for a brand name is the most difficult to clear. The FDA’s Division of Medication Error Prevention and Analysis is responsible for proprietary name review prior to approval, explained Lyndsay Meyer, a spokeswoman for the agency, noting that this division can require the company to select another name, for safety reasons, as part of the approval process. Two departments within the FDA — the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research — scrutinize each proposed name and then reject about 20% and 35% of the names, respectively. If reviewing names seems an unnecessary form of regulation, consider that the Institute of Medicine estimates that more than 1.5 million Americans are sickened, injured or killed each year by errors in prescribing, dispensing and taking medications. Meanwhile, a study published this year in the British Medical Journal found that 251,000 people die each year in the United States from medical error or medical care gone wrong, including drug name and dosage mixups. Medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US, after heart disease and cancer, say the study authors, making the goal of everyone in this industry to avoid what they call LASAs: lookalikes, sound-alikes. Name safety is now the number one priority, and predicting name approvability is now the name of the game, said Arlene Teck, creative director at Ixxéo Healthcare, a name engineering agency. The FDA wants to protect any American, traveling anywhere, from any kind of harm that could come from confusing one drug with any other drug or even a local food supplement. The possibility of drug name confusion keeps regulators up at night. Because they can nix any proposed name, the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and HealthCanada exert the strongest influence on drug names, according to Teck. In fact, she says, we are living in the regulated age of drug naming. And for those who believe that computerized prescriptions will reduce mistakes caused by illegible handwriting, a white paper (PDF) commissioned by the FDA found that lookalikes still cause mistakes when prescribers accidentally choose a similar drug name from a drop-down menu. Global influences The FDA has a whole host of reasons why it might require a different name than the one selected by a company. For instance, the use of certain word stems are officially protected by the International Nonproprietary Names program. Word stems are groups of letters, usually just two — os, for instance, or aj — that cannot appear within brand names, explains Teck, as it might cause confusion with a generic name. The FDA also rejects names that seem too fanciful or overstate a drug’s effectiveness and puts the kibosh on names that might stigmatize a patient (or condition). If you are wanting to do metaphors that are life-affirming, and you want to think of things like trees or flowers or something strong like metal, you cannot do that, because it might suggest an ingredient, Teck noted. The global nature of the pharmaceutical industry presents additional challenges. A name may be approved by the FDA and then rejected by European or Canadian authorities. To anticipate both the FDA and European Medicines Agency regulatory outcome, that’s really the number one mission of any team or any agency, said Denis Ezingeard, Teck’s naming partner and CEO of Geneva-based Ixxéo. If you fail, says Ezingeard, you’re down to square one. Even once a product is commercially launched, the FDA retains the authority to request a name change. In fact, the agency may request a name change if doctors report confusion and medical errors even after a drug can be found on the shelf at your local pharmacy. Naming drugs, says Ezingeard, is all about avoiding regulatory pitfalls and has become less and less about creation. After all, recovery from rejection, which could take a long time when coordinating the process across different countries, is costly and difficult. Because of the many rules and regulations, pharmaceutical naming has become highly specialized work that is mostly farmed out to highly specialized creative agencies. The creative process having developed strange and elaborate defenses to avert the disaster of rejection, namers resemble emus, those awkward birds that run instead of fly. Most agencies begin the process by playing the numbers game. For any assignment, the Ixxéo team creates between 2,000 and 5,000 names. That makes pharmaceutical naming different from consumer branding, where the constraints are not as stringent and where you can turn a much lower wheel of names, said Ezingeard, who refers to himself as Dr. Destructo. His job on the team is name elimination, because his primary concern is to get out of the way as many names as possible that are by their nature a possible liability. In the end, 10 are selected as promising from the original 2,000 or 3,000, and from there, the final selection of one name begins. The Brand Institute then typically submits two names at once to regulatory agencies, according to Piergrossi. But there are layers of contingency names in place, especially with Big Pharma planning years in advance, he said, adding, we are well-versed in what’s required by the regulators. Another way the Brand Institute’s subsidiary, the Drug Safety Institute, avoids rejection is by assessing name candidates using a methodology similar to those used by regulatory authorities. For example, FDA examiners are known to look at handwritten samples of a drug name and listen as a variety of people (each with different accents) pronounce the name. They also check for illegal stems, similarity to the names of discontinued products, and common medical or coined abbreviations tucked within the name. Meanwhile, examiners analyze for possible promotional claims and references to active or inert ingredients within the sound of the proposed name. Ixxéo has developed its own regulatory engineering model that mirrors the complex and evolving set of parameters used by regulatory authorities. It’s the very model the FDA could have built, but they didn’t do it, Ezingeard said. Beyond the rules Like poets who write Elizabethan sonnets rather than free verse, pharmaceutical namers must make difficult decisions based on arcane rules, but their work is still a form of artistry. Teck says Ezingeard, an engineer and polymath, developed Ixxéo’s elaborate naming process when he was studying Darwinian evolution. Creation engineering, as Teck refers to the drug-naming process, is based on evolutionary science as well as art history and merges creation with the screening process. In practice, this means swapping names back and forth between Teck, Ezingeard and Ignasi Fontvila, a colleague in Barcelona. Together, they craft names blended from English, French, German, Spanish and Catalan linguistics and based on four distinct dimensions: visual distinctiveness, melodic contrast, verbal velocity — how it sounds when spoken within a sentence — and language neutrality, which is the ability to work across many different languages. Teck and Fontvila then develop a final list of name candidates and tweak each other’s to ensure a higher chance of approval. Teck is legendary in the industry for naming Viagra while at Wood Worldwide in 1992. To name Pfizer’s blockbuster, she ran a focus group with urologists who treated erectile dysfunction. At the conclusion of the session, Teck asked one of the doctors what it felt like for men when the condition went away. The doctor said, Visualize a strong stream. Melding the words vigorous and Niagara, Teck came up with Viagra. Neo-linguistics Now an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary, Viagra is an example of how a name can fundamentally  create, not just change, conversation, Interbrand’s Fidelino said. Prior to Viagra, impotence was a psychological disorder that went to the core of how men defined themselves, he said. By creating a brand that is named in a way that allows people to discuss it, and creating language or using language to describe the condition in a way that makes it easier for people to engage in conversation, you had more people seeking treatment and also improving sexual health and relationships around the world.Later, Interbrand was tasked with creating a moniker for what’s now known as Cialis, a second-to-market impotence drug. But naming a drug that is not first to market is difficult because the name of the game is being unprecedented … being the breakthrough, Fidelino said. He explains that the goal was to find a sound that fit with Cialis’ improvements over its predecessor, the macho-sounding Viagra. Cialis’ treatment window is longer than that of Viagra — it works throughout the day — so if an opportunity arises, a man can spontaneously respond. This unique attribute and improvement over Viagra required new messages and a new framing, said Fidelino, who says naming drugs is about naming the invisible, the intangible. The resulting approach for Cialis was more about relationships and less about sex. A different type of emotion is conveyed by Cialis, rhapsodized Fidelino, noting that it’s a tonally softer name and more elegant. Of the many names created by the Brand Institute, Piergrossi says he is proudest of Latisse, the eyelash growth drug from Allergan. This name was crafted by merging two words: lash and Matisse, the French painter and sculptor. Latisse is marketed directly to consumers, so the name must appeal to those who will use the product. Names intended for doctors are often a play on words or technologies familiar to them or suggestive of a drug’s mechanism of action. For instance, the hepatitis B and C drug Pegasys, explains Fidelino, is based on a pharmaceutical technology known as pegalation. There’s no doubt that there’s virtue in the unusual, said Fidelino, but still, it’s helpful when there’s a real tie-back either to the attributes of the product, the technology of the product, the benefit of the product or the intended outcomes. All the namers acknowledge that this is far easier said than done. In the current consumer climate — often hostile toward Pharma, according to Fidelino — it’s incumbent upon these companies to help people appreciate what they do. This can be achieved, Fidelino believes, by going beyond the tricks and instead creating brands and marketing campaigns with real depth: I’m also a health care consumer, he said. I don’t want to see the public being duped by fancy, superficial promotions."}

{"id":824,"title":"Mercedes want Williams' Valtteri Bottas as Lewis Hamilton's team-mate","class":1,"body":"Williams driver Valtteri Bottas is Mercedes' first choice to replace Nico Rosberg as Lewis Hamilton's team-mate, BBC Sport has learned. But Williams have rejected an initial offer to release Finn Bottas from his 2017 contract. In a separate development, Mercedes technical boss Paddy Lowe is close to finalising a deal to join Williams. Lowe is set to be replaced at the world champions by former Ferrari technical director James Allison. Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff has zeroed in on Bottas as his favoured option as a replacement for Rosberg, who retired five days after winning his first world title last month despite having two further years on his Mercedes contract. Wolff has approached Williams with a proposal that he gives them a major reduction in their engine bill - said to be in the region of €10m euros (£8.4m); more than half the total fee - in return for releasing Bottas. Williams also have the option to run Mercedes reserve driver Pascal Wehrlein in Bottas' place. Wolff, who is part of Bottas' management team, sees the 27-year-old as a close like-for-like replacement for Rosberg - quick, a reliable and consistent points scorer, and relatively easy to manage alongside the more mercurial Hamilton. Williams have said no to Wolff's first offer but negotiations are expected to continue in the coming days. Williams feel they need an experienced contender in one of their cars next season because their other driver is Canadian rookie Lance Stroll. The 18-year-old, who won the Formula Three Euroseries in 2016 and comes with a budget reputed to be at least £20m, has been on an extensive test programme intended to prepare him comprehensively for his F1 debut. But Williams are concerned that partnering him with 22-year-old Wehrlein, who has only one year's experience with the back-of-the-grid Manor team, would be a significant risk to their chances of maximising their championship position. Each place in the constructors' table is worth millions of pounds. There is also a complication with Williams' sponsors, among them the drinks giant Martini, for which having two drivers under 25 does not sit well in promotional terms. German Wehrlein is also in talks with the Swiss Sauber team, which is yet to name a team-mate for Swede Marcus Ericsson. Another option for Williams would be to replace Bottas with Brazilian Felipe Nasr, who drove for Sauber in 2015 and 2016. Mercedes are believed to be reluctant to promote Wehrlein to a race seat because they believe he lacks the necessary experience to be a guaranteed performer who can help them retain the constructors' title. But Mercedes' other choices are limited - every other driver with experience is contracted to a rival. One outside possibility if a deal cannot be done with Williams is Carlos Sainz. The 22-year-old Spaniard is under contract to Red Bull next season to continue with their junior team Toro Rosso for a third season, but sources say the drinks company would release him if Mercedes came in for him. This has not yet been discussed extensively within Mercedes and would not be a preferred option, not least because of their difficult relationship with Red Bull. Lowe's departure from Mercedes would break up the technical team that has dominated F1 since 2014. In his role as executive director (technical), he has been in overall control of the sporting and technical sides of the team, with only Wolff in a more senior role. Williams have been courting the 54-year-for some months and sources close to the deal say he is now on the verge of finalising an agreement to rejoin the outfit where he started his F1 career nearly 30 years ago. Lowe has not yet held formal discussions about his future with Wolff, BBC Sport understands. Allison has had talks with Mercedes and is said by senior insiders to have agreed a deal to run the technical and design side of the team. The 48-year-old, who left Ferrari as part of a reshuffle in July, is one of the most highly-regarded aerodynamics experts and design leaders in F1. Sources close to Ferrari say he is on a year's gardening leave and could not join a rival until the summer of 2017. Lowe would also have to serve a notice period of at least six months once he and Wolff have held the talks that will determine his future. Allison worked at Ferrari through their dominant era with Michael Schumacher between 2000 and 2004; won two drivers' titles with Fernando Alonso at Renault in 2005 and 2006; and stayed there through its change into Lotus in 2012, before moving back to Ferrari in 2013. Following his split with the Italian team in the summer, Allison has already turned down offers from Williams and Renault. Red Bull are not interested in him. McLaren, who came close to signing him in 2012, have been told that Allison is not available because he is committed to another team - which they believe to be Mercedes."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":825,"title":"Antonio Conte: Chelsea boss laughs off points deduction claim","class":1,"body":"Chelsea boss Antonio Conte has laughed off suggestions his side could face a Premier League points deduction. The Blues and Manchester City have been charged with failing to control their players during their 3 December game. After previous incidents, a Football Association appeals board warned Chelsea in July that the time cannot be too far distant when... the only proper sanction is a points deduction. Asked about the possibility, Conte said: Are you joking? Are you joking? Chelsea have been fined five times by the FA for failing to control their players since February 2015. The Premier League leaders were originally fined a record £375,000 following three charges resulting from the 2-2 draw with Tottenham at Stamford Bridge in May. An appeal board reduced Chelsea's fine to £290,000 but referenced the club's lamentable recent record for failing properly to control its players. The last top-flight teams to be docked points for disciplinary issues were Manchester United and Arsenal following a brawl at Old Trafford in October 1990. The charges for Chelsea and Manchester City follow the mass fracas in the 95th minute of the game at Etihad Stadium, which Chelsea won 3-1. City had forward Sergio Aguero and midfielder Fernandinho sent off. Manchester City and Chelsea, at the end of the game, my players tried to keep their calm. I don't understand this. I repeat, I don't understand this, added Conte after his side's 1-0 win over West Brom on Sunday, which took them back to the top of the Premier League. We are trying to improve in all aspects. For this reason, I reply: you must be joking. You must be honest and understand which team is at fault. We had a bad record in the past, but now we are different. The FA commission which ruled on the charges that followed the Tottenham game said Chelsea's record of failing to control their players was abysmal and that there is a recidivist nature to the club's offending. The commission said it considered imposing a points deduction then but decided not to, with one of the reasons given that Chelsea have yet to receive a final warning that such transgressions simply cannot continue if a future regulatory commission is not to resort to other more draconian penalties. Chelsea, along with Tottenham, were warned as to their future conduct but there was no mention in the commission's report of a final warning for the Blues. Meanwhile, Conte said Chelsea striker Diego Costa is showing his passion in the right way after scoring his 12th league goal of the season to see off a stubborn West Brom side at Stamford Bridge. Costa was booked four times in his first seven games of the season but has not been shown a yellow card in his past 10 league and cup appearances for the Blues. If he is cautioned in Chelsea's next four games he will receive a one-match ban, as the cut-off date for a suspension after accumulating five bookings is 31 December. January is arriving, no? It's incredible, said Conte of Costa's run without any bookings. If you ask my why in the past I don't know. But now if you ask me about Diego I can talk well about his work-rate, commitment and behaviour. For me, it's fantastic. I always say to my players, 'stay focused on the pitch'. I don't like the provocation. I want to have players with great behaviours. Costa was booked nine times in domestic matches in 2014-15, his first season at Chelsea, and was shown eight more last season, plus a red card in the FA Cup defeat against Everton in March. His punishment for that dismissal at Goodison Park was a two-game ban, with an additional one-match suspension for his reaction to the red card. Costa has also served retrospectively awarded three-match bans for stamping on Liverpool's Emre Can in a League Cup semi-final in January 2015, and violent conduct in altercations with Arsenal's Laurent Koscielny and Gabriel in September 2015."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":826,"title":"FA reform: Former chiefs say 'elderly white men' block change","class":1,"body":"The Football Association (FA) is outdated, held back by elderly white men and unable to counter the power of the Premier League, say five former executives of the governing body. David Bernstein, David Davies, Greg Dyke, Alex Horne and David Triesman say the FA has failed to self-reform.The five have asked Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport committee to propose legislation to reform the FA. They describe the FA's decision-making structures as arcane and convoluted. It may well move us to redressing the woeful lack of English players or managers and the embarrassing failures of our national team for the past 50 years, the five conclude in a letter to MP Damian Collins, chairman of the committee. Collins responded by saying the committee shares your concern and confirmed a draft bill to deliver the necessary reform was being prepared. Dyke is the most recent of the five to have held a position at the FA, which they say has an inability to reform and modernise in a fast-changing world. Triesman became the FA's first independent chairman in January 2008 but resigned in 2010, later saying it was impossible to make the changes he wanted during his time in the role. Bernstein spent three years in the same role before stepping down in 2013 and being succeeded by Dyke, who left the position in August before being replaced by Greg Clarke. Davies is a former executive director, while Horne was finance director, managing director of Wembley Stadium, chief operating officer and general secretary at the FA, before leaving in January 2015 after 11 years at the organisation. In their letter, they highlighted the domination of the Premier League (EPL) because of its financial might, and added that worse still, there are some 25 life vice-presidents on the FA Council - all elderly white men - who do not represent anyone but block even the most minor of changes. They said: It is little wonder that English football is out of balance. The FA has neither the modernity of approach nor independence required to counter the EPL juggernaut, or to modernise its own governance. The quintet agreed with the findings of the Culture, Media and Sport committee's reports on football governance in 2011 and 2013, which concluded that the FA needed urgent reform. The FA has been given more than enough time to self-reform and therefore we now ask that parliament take this on board, recognise that further promises of change are not serious, and legislate as necessary, including the appointment of a regulator to achieve the changes that are so desperately needed, the five said. The FA says it is working on governance reforms to adhere to Sport England and UK Sport's Governance Code for Sport, which was released in October. The FA welcomes the new Code as a means of ensuring that sports organisations in receipt of public money are operating in an effective and transparent manner that best supports their sports, the governing body said in a statement. We will continue to work with the appropriate bodies, DCMS [Department for Culture, Media and Sport] and Sport England, to achieve this joint ambition. The Premier League says it has kept patience when past chairmen and chief executives have failed to deliver and has supported the FA's reforms. We will keep working hard‎ to ensure standards are maintained and bettered, it said in a statement. Others in the game have a responsibility to do the same. For years, the FA has stubbornly resisted mounting pressure from fans and politicians to modernise and break the stranglehold of the vested interests on its Board. But this blistering attack on the way football is run - and the Premier League's dominance of power and wealth - could prove harder to ignore. At a time when football is already under intense scrutiny over the child sex abuse scandal, these former FA executives - along with the Culture, Sport and Media committee - have thrown down a gauntlet; the demand for legislation, a regulator and even a vote of no confidence in the FA will horrify a sport that fiercely guards its autonomy, and insists it has made recent progress. However, while the government has threatened the FA with funding cuts unless reforms happen soon, its appetite to get even tougher is far from certain.

Pressure is mounting on authorities to strip the Russian city of the March event after a report claimed more than 1,000 Russians benefited from state-sponsored doping between 2011 and 2015. Sochi hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics, where Russia won 33 medals. The Olympic spirit was stolen in 2014, said the Latvian team, who won skeleton and bobsleigh medals in Sochi. While our international federation is still going to 'read and digest the report', we will do what we can, they added in a statement.

Latvia won silver in the four-man bobsleigh and silver in the men's skeleton at the 2014 Games. Their four-man bobsleigh team are also the current world champions. Great Britain and the United States are waiting for the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation to make an official statement before taking a decision on their participation.

{"id":828,"title":"Dario Gradi: Crewe Alexandra director suspended pending FA investigation","class":1,"body":"Crewe Alexandra director Dario Gradi has been suspended pending a Football Association investigation that will include looking into claims he smoothed over a complaint of sexual assault against a Chelsea scout in the 1970s. A former youth player at Chelsea - where Gradi was assistant manager - says he was assaulted by Eddie Heath, the club's chief scout, when he was 15. Gradi, 75, denies any wrongdoing and says he will help the FA's review. Heath, who has since died, has been accused by several people of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s. The BBC understands that the FA, as part of its widened review into child sex abuse allegations, expects to question Gradi after the Independent reported that, in 1974, he went to see the parents of a youth player at Chelsea about a sexual assault. The former youth player - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - told the newspaper: He [Gradi] came to visit my parents and me to smooth it over. I remember him saying something like: '[With] Eddie, [football] is his life and he gets a bit close to the boys. I'm sorry if he's overstepped the mark in his fondness this time.' Chelsea are not known to have taken any action and Gradi has made no specific comments on this claim or his links with Heath. In a statement on Friday, he said: Aside from denying any wrongdoing, it would be inappropriate and unfair on all parties to comment piecemeal through the media at this time in connection with historical allegations. Suffice to say, I will do everything within my power to assist all investigatory authorities into what is becoming a wide-ranging and important enquiry into historical sexual abuse. League Two club Crewe Alexandra have not yet responded to a request for comment. The FA has given no indication about who will be spoken to as part of its review. Gradi has previously said he knew nothing about the alleged abuse of young footballers by anyone connected with Crewe until 1994 and that he then co-operated with the authorities. Despite failing to win any major honours in his management career, Gradi developed a reputation as a fine coach of young players, primarily at Crewe Alexandra. Born in Milan, Italy he came to the UK as a child after the Second World War and went on to play football at non-league level, before becoming Chelsea assistant coach in 1971, aged 29. He remained at the London club until 1976, before returning to Sutton United, who he used to play for. Following spells as manager of Wimbledon and Crystal Palace, he began an association with Crewe in 1983 that now spans 33 years. He was manager from 1983 to 2007, leading the team to the second tier of English football for the first time in 1997, and was awarded an MBE for services to football a year later. Crewe's 11th-placed finish in their first year in the second tier remains the highest finish in the club's history. During Gradi's tenure, the club won the PFA Bobby Moore Fair Play Trophy 12 times in 15 years. Having had a spell as director of football, Gradi had a second stint as manager from 2009 to 2011 before returning to the overseeing role he still occupies. In 2013, aged 72, Gradi became the oldest person appointed to Greg Dyke's FA commission charged with improving English football from the grassroots upwards. Described by the National Football Museum as one of English football's best developers of young players, Gradi's tenure at Crewe has seen internationals David Platt, Geoff Thomas, Danny Murphy, Seth Johnson, Robbie Savage and Dean Ashton emerge. The National Football Museum inducted Gradi into its Hall of Fame in 2004, and he was given the Football League's outstanding contribution to football award in 2011.

Today - Kadeena Cox and Mo Farah. Cycling gold in Rio meant she was the first Briton since 1988 to win a medal in two sports at the same Paralympics. Cox, from Leeds, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis two years ago. She earned a gold in the T38 athletics 400m and triumphed in the C4-5 time trial. She also took athletics silver in the T35-38 4x100m relay and bronze in the T38 100m. Picked to be GB's flagbearer at the Rio closing ceremony, a brilliant year also saw her claim a track cycling World Championship gold in the 500m time trial. Cox began sprinting competitively aged 15 and went on to run 100m in under 12 seconds. She was also bidding for a place on the GB bob skeleton winter sports programme before illness struck. A stroke aged 23 led to her being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. But despite the MS affecting her movement, especially down the right side of her body, her ability to run fast remained. She returned to the track, also discovered a flair for cycling, and pleaded to be part of both squads. Cox now splits her time between the Manchester Velodrome, where she is based with the rest of the GB Para-cycling squad, and her athletics training in Leeds. In Rio, she became the first British Paralympian since Isabel Barr (later Newstead) in 1988 to win medals in two separate sports at the same Games, and the first since Barr in 1984 to win golds in different sports. What she said: I have only been doing it a year and a half and being on top of the world is amazing. Zoe McCartney: Competing in two separate events, winning two golds, a silver and a bronze medal and setting two new world records. Inspiring. Dan Quinton: Kadeena Cox deserves recognition. She did wonders in Rio in both events. Stacey Ellis: Would be great if she won. Amazing achievement. Sports Personality record: First nomination. No Paralympian has won the main award, though wheelchair racer David Weir was fifth in 2012.

{"id":831,"title":"Advantage, Tennis: Study Shows Racket Games Are Best Sport for Heart Health","class":1,"body":"Billions of people around the world love tennis, badminton and squash, and now racket sports are loving them right back in the form of reduced mortality risk. According to the results of a study recently published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, these sports lead the pack in reduced risk of death from all causes by 47 percent, with a 56 percent lower risk of heart disease and stroke-related death, to boot. The study followed survey respondents for an average of nine years per person between 1994 and 2008. More than 80,000 adults over age 30 in England and Scotland were surveyed about the type, amount and intensity of physical activity completed during the four weeks prior. The survey inquired about the six most popular sports: cycling, swimming, running, football, racket sports and aerobics. Of the initial 80,306 responders, 8,790 died from any cause, including 1,909 from stroke or cardiovascular disease (CVD), also known as heart disease, during the study period. The risk-reduction numbers were calculated in comparison with survey responders who didn't engage in any of the sports during the same period. We know that all these sports have beneficial short term effects on e.g. cardiovascular risk factors, explains lead researcher Dr. Pekka Oja of the UKK Institute in Finland in an email interview. Therefore, one would expect that these effects might show up also in the mortality rates. However, up till now there has not been measured evidence of the effects of specific sports on the all-cause or cardiovascular disease mortality. No significant reductions were found for participating in cycling, running or football (soccer to Americans). Death due to any cause was 47 percent less for players of racket sports, 28 percent less for swimmers and 27 percent less for aerobics enthusiasts. Cyclists also showed a 15 percent reduction in that risk. Again, there were no significant reductions for people participating in running or football. For Canadian personal trainer and nutritionist Jamie Logie, the findings reinforce what he already knew. Sports like swimming and aerobics tend to be at a higher intensity and this intensity increase appears to be what can help in preventing death from heart disease. The sports listed require more muscle use and a combination of aerobic and anaerobic energy systems, he says via email. Racket ball is the perfect example of a high-intensity type workout where you perform an all-out exertion for a certain time period followed by a slower rest/recovery phase. When you perform what is also called high-intensity interval training like this, it increases your metabolic rate and lowers your insulin resistance, he says. This helps create skeletal muscle adaptions which help you burn more fat and create glucose tolerance. Research has shown that heart disease is linked more to your intake of sugar and carbs rather than to your intake of saturated fat. So when you perform higher intensity exercise you allow your body to get into a better hormonal state so that it can manage the sugar it takes in. A lack of exercise does the complete opposite and leads to more heart disease, adds Logie. So far, so good. But why did running and soccer fare so poorly at reducing deaths? Well, certain limitations affected the researchers' ability to analyze that data. The percentage of survey participants who played soccer/football was very low. And though running has been shown to reduce CVD and all causes of death in other studies, the authors speculate four weeks might have been too short to show an impact in this activity. The runners (as well as the football players) were younger than participants in the other sports to begin with. We would need five to 10 years' further follow-up to find out how effective participation in running is, Oja notes. Still disheartened? Don't toss those trainers in the trash just yet. This is the first large scale study of the kind. It shows clear associations, but one study doesn't demonstrate the 'truth,' he explains. We need more similar studies to corroborate these results. We also need studies with other common sports in order to demonstrate the health potential of the whole spectrum of sport participation. One can choose any one of these sports according to one's personal likings and opportunities in order to reduce the risk of death, Oja adds. So, for your best shot, engage in what suits you most."}

Bordeaux’s director of rugby, Raphael Ibanez, skipped this fixture to fulfil his duties for French television in Toulon and his side could not have been blamed had they simply dialled in a performance on a chilly, foggy Sunday night in Devon. Instead they dug in sufficiently to terminate Exeter’s interest in the Champions Cup for this season barring a miraculous sequence of results. The contest only rarely approached great heights in terms of sparkling pre-Christmas entertainment and also proved a largely unrewarding evening, among others, for Jack Nowell and Henry Slade, both desperate to impress the watching England head coach, Eddie Jones. Jones, it can be confidently predicted, will not have gone home marvelling at the overall skill level of this contest. Conditions, it has to be said, were not remotely helpful. The ball was greasy and visibility at times resembled something out of the Hound of the Baskervilles, with Ibanez far from alone in missing some of the action. By the time Nigel Owens blew for half-time the bright electronic scoreboard was offering the only effective clues as to what was going on, although happily there was a significant improvement after half-time.

He pitched an inning or two against a team from the Cuban military police and, by some accounts, struck out two batters. He threw a few pitches, people were swinging wildly and letting themselves be struck out by the Leader, said Roberto González Echevarría, a native of Cuba who is a literature professor at Yale and the author of The Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball. Mr. Castro, who died Friday at 90, also avidly followed Havana’s Sugar Kings of the International League, a Class AAA team in the Cincinnati Reds’ farm system from 1954 to 1960. He went to some games because he was a fan and he liked being on TV, Mr. González Echevarría said. The persistent notion that Mr. Castro’s fastball had made him a potential big league prospect has long been debunked by historians. By many accounts, his primary sport as a schoolboy was basketball. He was tall, at 6-foot-2 or 6-foot-3, and he told the biographer Tad Szulc that the anticipation, speed and dexterity required for basketball most approximated the skills needed for revolution. Yet it was primarily baseball, along with boxing and other Olympic sports, that came to symbolize both the strength and vulnerability of Cuban socialism. Successes in those sports allowed Mr. Castro to taunt and defy the United States on the diamond and in the ring and to infuse Cuban citizens with a sense of national pride. At the same time, international isolation and difficult financial realities led to the rampant defection of top baseball stars, the decrepit condition of stadiums and a shortage of equipment. The former Soviet bloc and China also acutely understood the value of sporting achievement as propaganda, but there seemed to be some fundamental differences in Mr. Castro’s Cuba. For one thing, Cuba under Mr. Castro promoted mass sport, not simply elite sport. About 95 percent of Cubans have participated in some form of organized sport or exercise, from children who start physical education classes at age 5 to grandmothers who gather to practice tai chi, said Robert Huish, an associate professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who has studied Cuban sport, health and social programs. Secondly, I think Fidel Castro legitimately liked sports, said David Wallechinsky, the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians. One got the sense with East Germany, for example, that it really was a question of propaganda and that government officials didn’t have that obsession with sport itself that Fidel Castro did. Whatever hardships they endured, Cubans could take pride in their sports stars. As Javier Sotomayor, the only man to clear eight feet in the high jump, soared to his records in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cubans for a time marked the height of his jumps in their doorways, according to Robert Huish, an associate professor of international development studies at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who has studied Cuban sport, health and social programs. There was a real effort to connect nationalistic pride to athletic achievement, said Mr. Huish, who was scheduled to make his 42nd trip to Cuba on Monday. Boxing became a really important factor in that. You would hear how it was connected to revolution and how socialism and having universal access to sport meant that the victory of the boxer is really everyone’s victory. Teófilo Stevenson, a three-time Olympic heavyweight boxing champion from 1972 to 1980, once famously explained why he had turned down a chance to sign a professional contract and perhaps to fight Muhammad Ali, saying, What is a million dollars’ worth compared to the love of eight million Cubans? The idea that sports were healthy and good for developing bodies, Mr. González Echevarría said, derived from the American role in helping to establish Cuba’s educational system while occupying the country from 1898 to 1902 after the Spanish-American War. In Castro’s Cuba, Cuba’s Fidel, a biography by the American photojournalist Lee Lockwood, Mr. Castro spoke little of baseball, instead stressing his long love for basketball, chess, deep-sea diving, soccer and track and field. I never became a champion, he told Mr. Lockwood, adding, but I didn’t practice much. In 1946, an F. Castro was listed in a box score as having pitched in an intramural game at the University of Havana, where Fidel Castro attended law school, though González Echevarría said he could not confirm it was the future leader. The only known photographs of Mr. Castro in a baseball uniform were taken while he played for Los Barbudos, the informal revolutionary team, Mr. González Echevarría said. Mr. Castro was never scouted by the major leagues, Mr. González Echevarría said, and the notion that Mr. Castro was once a promising pitcher is really a lie. Instead, Peter C. Bjarkman, a baseball historian, argues that Mr. Castro’s post-revolutionary identification with baseball derived from two factors: One, an acknowledgment of the entrenched popularity of a sport played in Cuba since the 1860s and as popular there as soccer was in Brazil. And two, a stoking of revolutionary zeal at home and a forging of propaganda victories abroad. While Mr. Castro staged some exhibitions and played some pickup games after coming to power, a primary objective was to bedevil the United States in a calculated step toward utilizing baseball as a means of besting the hated imperialists at their own game, Mr. Bjarkman wrote in an article for the Society for American Baseball Research. Mr. Castro banned professional sports in Cuba in 1961, and several years later, said, Anybody who truly loves sport, and feels sport, has to prefer this sport to professional sport by a thousand times. His strategy worked for decades as Cuba played baseball against mostly amateur competition, or non-major leaguers, winning 18 championships in the Baseball World Cup from 1961 to 2005 and three Olympic gold medals from 1992 to 2004. But the collapse of the Soviet Union (and later Venezuela’s oil economy), cost Cuba its financial benefactors. And its dominance began to ebb amid rampant defections of top Cuban players and the growing inclusion of professionals from other nations in international baseball tournaments. Cuba won only one of the three Olympic tournaments held after 1996, before baseball was discontinued for the 2012 London Games (it will return at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.) And Cuba has yet to win the World Baseball Classic, a quadrennial tournament that began in 2006 and features major leaguers. Meanwhile, the American trade embargo, still in place even though the two countries have begun to normalize relations, has left Cuba with poor sports facilities, including some pools with no water; fewer night baseball games because of the cost keeping the lights on; games halted in some stadiums until fans can retrieve foul balls; and a leaky roof and soaked mats at the national wrestling center. In 2013, Cuban officials took a more pragmatic approach to professionalism, allowing athletes to compete for earnings and to play in other countries (though not in Major League Baseball). Cuban coaches are also being exported to other countries in exchange for hard currency. The athletes keep 80 percent of their winnings and agree to compete for Cuba in international competitions. Antonio Castro, a son of Fidel Castro and a vice president of the International Baseball Federation, told ESPN in 2014 that Cuban players should be permitted to play in the Major Leagues and be able to return to Cuba without fear. Then no one loses, Antonio Castro said. And they don’t have to be separated from their family, from their friends. But after President Obama attended an exhibition baseball game in Havana in March as the first sitting American president to visit Cuba since the 1959 revolution, Fidel Castro threw a brushback pitch. In a column, he criticized renewed relations between the two countries, writing, We don’t need the empire to give us anything. An article on Monday about the way sports symbolized the strength and vulnerability of Cuban socialism under Fidel Castro misstated, in some editions, when baseball was discontinued as a sport at the Olympics. It was for the 2012 London Games, not the 2008 Games, which were in Beijing."}

On July 18, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren released his findings from an independent investigation, published by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Commission, and put together by WADA to examine allegations of doping in athletics. he report surrounded alleged state-sponsored Russian violations of anti-doping laws by Russian athletes in the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. In all seriousness, after December 9 it will be clear, what will happen. There will be yet another attempt [of an attack] on Russian sport, Mutko said. Nobody knows what there will be, everyone is sitting and waiting. They are publishing the report and in a week there will be a big commotion. We don’t have an opportunity to protest, they will name and shame to the whole world, and then we will begin to figure it out. As with the [Russian] Paralympians – they excluded them at first, and after six months they wrote an entire law on recovery and then excluded them for that. But they needed to prove this.

{"id":835,"title":"Russia is spending $30 million on an obscure sport called acrobatic rock'n'roll","class":1,"body":"According to Reuters, Moscow has approved the construction of a complex devoted entirely to the niche sport at the cost of 1.9 billion roubles, or more than $30 million. It will be the first center of its kind in the world, the sport’s governing body, the World Rock'n'Roll Confederation told Reuters. But why is Russia spending tens of millions of dollars on a sport that just 9,000 Russians compete in? According to an official statement from Moscow, where the facility will be constructed, it’s just part of the city’s devotion to athletics. Moscow attaches great importance to building sports facilities. Over the past five years in Moscow the number of new sports facilities being brought on-stream has effectively doubled, the statement read. Others, however, have noted that Russian president Vladimir Putin’s youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, just so happens to have been trained in acrobatic rock’n’roll, competed in the sport, is a vice president at the WRRC and helps to run the sport’s national federation. The Kremlin declined to comment on the possible connection, per Reuters. Even without the facility, Russia has done well in the sport in recent years, with five world championships since 2006, per the WRRC’s website. Tikhonova and her partner are ranked 11th in the world. Moscow’s decision to commit millions to the sport, more than it does to archery or biathlon, sports that country has won Olympic medals in in the past, is especially controversial given several details of the project and recent allegations of widespread state-sponsored doping. Reuters reports that the facility will be nearly 140,000 square feet and will feature a 2,000-person competition space, swimming pool, gymnasium and helicopter pad. Reuters cited political opposition who said the project was specifically for Tikhonova. Allegations of state interference in Russian athletics is nothing new. On Friday, the World Anti-Doping Agency released a report detailing massive state-sponsored doping across 1,000 athletes and multiple sports stretching back at least four years. As a result, many are calling for the International Olympic Committee to impose harsh penalties against the country for future Olympic Games. Dancesport, or competitive dancing, is not an Olympic sport, but it is one of several dozen sports with federations recognized by the IOC. Regardless, as news of the acrobatic rock’n’roll facility spread on social media, several observers expressed gratitude for being exposed to the wildly unusual sport."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":836,"title":"No state doping program in Russia, zero tolerance on violations – Sports Ministry","class":1,"body":"The Russian Sports Ministry says it will thoroughly examine the information presented in the latest McLaren report on alleged doping by Russian athletes, and is eager to cooperate with international anti-doping bodies. The Sports Ministry denied McLaren’s allegations that Russian athletes concealed positive doping tests and that there was a state-sponsored doping system operating in Russia, a statement published on the ministry’s website said. Russia’s Sports Ministry says with all responsibility that there is no state-run program promoting doping in sport, the ministry said in the statement, adding that it pledges to fight doping with a zero-tolerance policy. Russia’s Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov believes Richard McLaren used the wrong terms when speaking of Russia's doping scheme allegedly sponsored by the government. McLaren said 'a state-run scheme'. This is the wrong term. There have been no schemes at all, Kolobkov said, according to his press-service. Russia’s law enforcement agencies are investigating certain violations, I would say, even crimes, carried out in particular by Rodchenkov and his possible accomplices, Kolobkov said referring to former head of Moscow anti-doping lab Grigory Rodchenkov who allegedly ran a massive doping ring, destroyed thousands of Russian athletes' doping control samples and was the single named source in the McLaren report It would be great if they [the WADA] probed into doping violations in other countries as vigorously [as they do in Russia], the minister said. On the other hand, it’s good to hear that McLaren took notice of our initiatives aimed at cleaning Russian sport of doping. I must say, we are doing this not under their pressure, but because we are interested in clean sport more than others, Kolobkov said. Measures have already been introduced to combat doping in compliance with the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport and Council of Europe’s Anti-Doping Convention, the statement adds. The IOC has issued a statement following McLaren’s report, promising to re-analyze urine samples taken from Russian athletes at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, while confirming that re-analyzed blood samples from the Games were found to be clean. The Sports Ministry is calling for an investigation into the McLaren report. Russia’s relevant authorities are investigating all of the circumstances listed in the first part of McLaren’s report, and the Sports Ministry will advise those authorities to carry out a similarly thorough investigation of what has been said in the second part, the ministry statement reads. The latest part of the McLaren report is outdated as after the first section came out, Russian legislation was changed to grant independence to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), said the head of Russia’s Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, Vitaly Smirnov. Personally, I am convinced there is no system of manipulations and violations organized or supported by the government, and there cannot be one. It goes against everything that is being done [in Russia], Smirnov told journalists. Athletes should simply keep on getting ready for PyeongChang [2018 Winter Games] along with their coaches, following their comprehensive, target-oriented programs, the ROC’s first vice-president, Stanislav Pozdnyakov, told R-Sport news agency in a telephone interview. We haven’t actually heard anything new and shouldn’t lose our temper, [we should] systematically fight against doping in our country. I see it as the only way to deal with the problem, Pozdnyakov said, adding that if Russia manages to create a transparent system, there will be no reports such as the one by McLaren. Russia will no longer accept accusations without evidence, said Yelena Isinbayeva, who is an Olympic pole vault champion and also chief of the RUSADA observing board. The Russian anti-doping body will demand that WADA provides proof of doping abuses and lists the names of the alleged perpetrators, Isinbayeva added. From now on we will not tolerate their allegations starting with ‘All of you’ and ‘You have a state-backed program.’ All that is in the past. The current task is to regain credibility and to make all WADA officials certain that we don't stay idle but do our utmost for the sake of restoring our agency, Isinbayeva said, according to TASS. If what the McLaren report alleges is true, it raises questions over the International Olympic Committee's competence, anti-doping litigation lawyer Gregory Ioannidis believes. We need to actually understand that if we make references to the specific Olympic Games which are mentioned in the report, we have to ask the question: who has the responsibility for the organization of the Games? And the answer is simple: the International Olympic Committee. So my question is: why has the situation gone on undetected for such a long time? Legendary USSR and Russian hockey player, MP and activist, Vyacheslav Fetisov, suggested that doping control samples from all athletes who took part in the Olympic Games in London, Rio and Sochi should be re-tested in the wake of the McLaren report, to see how grave the whole situation is. German extreme swimmer Marco Henrichs, who is also a runner and coach, believes that the scrutiny of the Russian Olympic team has nothing to do with so-called fair play, and was initiated for another reason. There is no doubt that doping naturally exists in other countries and in Germany as well. I think that these intensive probes into Russian sport are partially used to create a negative impression of Russians, Henrichs told RT."}

The Roosters player was allegedly asleep at the Palm Beach property when he was awoken by screaming, and he saw a man destroying property and yelling at a woman. He was reportedly knocked unconscious. Host Theo Chambers, a mortgage broker and the son of Chambers Cellars owner Steven Chambers, has moved to distance the Palmbu event from the incident. I would like to particularly stress that the apparent break and entry and assault which took place at my premises the day after the charity event, happened a considerable time after the event had been closed and all attendees had been cleared from the premises by licenced security, Theo Chambers said in a statement provided to AAP by his lawyers. I had also left and locked up the property for the evening. There is no information suggesting that the charity event and the break and entry and assault were in any way connected. As more information comes to hand, I will consider pressing charges and any other claims I may have against those responsible. Chambers said the event raised more than $13,000 for charity. A police spokeswoman said emergency services were called to the Bynya Road premises around 3am on Sunday following reports of a fight. Two men, aged 33 and 24, and a 26-year-old woman, were treated at the scene by NSW ambulance paramedics for minor injuries, the spokeswoman said. Six hundred people attended the party at the Palm Beach mansion, which is an annual charity event called Palmbu in support of the Vasculitis Foundation. The Roosters issued a brief statement saying they were aware of the incident and the NRL had been informed.

{"id":838,"title":"Misplaced priorities ‘killing’ Nigerian sports, says Adelabu","class":1,"body":"Former Green Eagles’ winger, Adegoke Adelabu has attributed the problem facing the nation’s sports to ‘misplaced priorities’ on the part of the people saddled with the responsibility of developing the sport. For the eighth day, players of the victorious Super Falcons are protesting in Abuja over non-payment of camp allowances and winning bonuses for their participation at the 10th African Women Nation’s Cup in Cameroon, which they won. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is also said to own the coaches nine months salaries. The protesting players have refused to hand over the trophy they won in Cameroon to the NFF. Adelabu, who was part of the Green Eagles’ squad to Libya ’82 African Nations Cup, told The Guardian yesterday that the high degree of challenges facing the nation’s sport is an indication for capacity development. One of the greatest factors that drives sport all over the world (the economy of talents) has become the major obstacle to our development because of misplaced priorities on the part of Nigerian sports administrators. Recently, we heard about the tragedy in Brazil, when a plane conveying a football team crashed; imagine those players of blessed memory not haven been paid salaries and allowances for several months? This is how fragile life could be. Many of our players have sustained injuries in the past, which had wrecked their lives and careers. Yet we owe players salaries and allowance with impunity, he stated. Adelabu played for the then IICC Shooting Stars of Ibadan in the mid 1980s. He said that sport is a big business platform, and there is no reason why majority of Nigerian athletes should be suffering after serving the nation or their clubs. Apart from few ex-players running soccer academies, which to me are substandard, but at least players have an avenue to showcase their talents. How many ex-athletes can you see with tangible businesses? Hardly can you get one! All of us do not have to go through the four walls of the university. Sport is a big business platform and there is no reason why majority of our athletes should be suffering after serving the nation or their clubs. We need to understand the concept of the Economy of Talents. That people have the potential capability to contribute to the economy of the nation by trading with their talents if they are properly managed. This should stir up the interest of the government in this concept. Speaking further, Adelabu, a Sports Scientist said: The question we need to ask ourselves is why do we subject athletes to training and competitions if not to build the economy through their talents? I think we are the only country in the world who always complain about money, while trading with the talents of our athletes. Our athletes have brought a lot improvement to the way other nations perceive Nigeria. Hence, they deserve better compensation. Our sport should be packaged (marketed) in such a way that will reflect how people would like to see it before they can buy into it. This will require a high level of intelligent presentation of the objectives of each game, the transformation they are going to bring to the lives of the athletes, the competitive atmosphere and the resultant effect on the emotional appetite of the people to seek for more. Everyone is crazy about premiership and others. Why can’t we be like that? According to Adelabu, the development of a sport is reflected in nation’s ability to modify the training, participation and competitive strategy of the athletes. This brings me to the issue of our inhuman approach to the way we manage our athletes; which consequently affect their long term production capacity. How can someone playing for the national team complain of unpaid allowances? That is a crime against human dignity. Athletes economy is based on the value placed on their performances. When you don’t pay allowances, what you are saying is that they are of no value. Despite the fact that we have won so many competitions in the past and present, it does not reflect in our cognitive approach to sport development, hence we do not have the basis upon which subsequent development will take place. We need to be able to scientifically analyse or enumerate our process goals, because they will help us to account for our outcome goals. It is a good way of managing the productive capacities of our athletes. The ex-IICC Shooting Stars winger further said: We need to admit that we have problems and there should be the willingness to deal with them and not just take advantage of the system to enrich ourselves. Though we are competing in various competitions, but we are in recession in the economy of our talents. All our athletes must be packaged in such a way that they may be useful to themselves when they retire from active sport."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":839,"title":"Should Football Be Banned? Doctors Debate High School Sport Risks From CTE And Concussions","class":1,"body":"Doctors and parents alike are debating whether it's safe to have high schoolers play football as the risk of degenerative disease from concussions become more apparent. As concussion diagnoses grow more common and after top NFL officials formally acknowledge in March the link between the sport and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a group of doctors set out to determine whether the benefits of playing the sport really outweigh the risks, in a discussion published in Pediatrics, a monthly peer-reviewed medical journal. Some doctors took a hard-line stance on discontinuing the sport in high school altogether, while others emphasized the need for a better understanding of concussion risks during play. Pediatricians should advocate for the discontinuation of high school football programs until, and more importantly unless, we can be assured that it does not have long-term detrimental consequences, said Dr. Lewis Margolis of the University of North Carolina. Dr. Greg Canty of Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City said the conversation needs to extend far beyond football. We need to remember the large increases in concussion have been seen across all sports, including soccer, hockey and basketball. It extends across gender lines into female sports where the incidence may be even higher, said Canty. If we eliminate football, what sport is next and what is our threshold? Who is going to be responsible for defining ‘safe play?’ Emergency department visits for concussions and other traumatic brain injuries increased by 70 percent from 2001 to 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. How much of that is due to increased awareness versus an actual increase in concussions is unclear. CTE is a progressive brain injury formerly attributed solely to boxers but increasingly discovered in professional football players. Currently, the condition can only be diagnosed after death, placing increased importance on awareness of risk factors that can cause the disease. Many experts in sports medicine believe that football can be made safe enough, said Dr. John Lantos of Children’s Mercy Hospital. Given that, pediatricians should try to help parents and school boards understand the facts. They should also insure that a culture of safety prevails over a culture of winning at any cost."}

{"id":841,"title":"Muhammad Ali remembered by Davis Miller","class":1,"body":"I’m about as agnostic as you can be, but throughout my life it’s as if Muhammad Ali has saved me. We shared a birthday, 17 January. When, as a young child, my mum died, I was nearly catatonically depressed, I didn’t speak with anyone. But just watching Ali on television lifted me out of that. Partly because of that experience, Ali influenced me to become a writer, and for much of the last 30 years that I have known him, he has been my principal subject. Without Ali I might be selling cars. There are many people who felt like that about him. At the beginning of December, six months after he died, I had an email from his wife, Lonnie, just sharing memories. She had been in love with Ali since she was a kid – their mothers were friends. They first met when she was six and they stayed close over the years. She told me just before his death that she knew at the age of 19 she’d be the last person he would be with, that he would die with her. She didn’t seek that, she just knew it would happen. I think Ali would have probably died five or 10 years before, had it not been for Lonnie. She gave him the largest life she could. She dealt with the users and abusers around him, saved what was left of his fortune and did what she could do with his health. She allowed him to be what he always was, which was a transcendent figure. I think he became an even greater man in his later years. I spent thousands of hours with him and I never once heard him complain about his illness, apart from one time, when he turned to me and said: Man, just think what I could be doing if I didn’t have this! But that was it. He went from superman to everyman. With the Parkinson’s, he became everyone’s ailing family member and he had that disease for over 30 years. His trainer, Angelo Dundee, told me that he always thought Ali would beat his illness and, in effect, that’s what he did. His great gift was to be able to step up and outside himself, and make other people do that too. You could see it even in those late fights when he seemed to purposely take a tremendous pounding. Even in the midst of it he could step away from it for a moment, as if to say: Look at me, I’m the world’s greatest punchbag, but you can’t hurt me. By the time I met him, in 1988, he was proving that every day. I asked him: What does it feel like to be a great man not allowed to be great? He said simply: You don’t question God. He is showing me and showing you that I am just a man like everyone else. There is a perception that he became a Buddha-like figure in those years, but in reality he was no less Ali than he had ever been. I have seen him be insanely narcissistic, as much as Donald Trump, the difference being that Ali had the capacity to let you know that he could be just as interested in anyone around him. Every time I was in public with him, it was the same. He would get out of the car and stand on the street, and in two minutes there would be 500 people, all wanting to make contact with him. He would look deeply at them in return and let them know that connection meant something to him. There must be tens of thousands of people all over the world who will never forget that look. The last time I saw him was in September 2015. I had seen him a few months before and he looked horrible, and that hit me very deeply. But in September, Lonnie had made sure he gained 20lb and he looked more like Ali. He was playful, doing magic tricks for children, doing the routines, being Ali. He never tired of that, and he knew people wanted it. He was, even then, this kind of cosmic brat: he always needed to pull up the carpet of the universe and see what was underneath. He is a genuinely mythological figure, I think, though not in a pop star way. He is not Madonna. He is not even the Beatles. He is someone the poet Homer would have liked to get hold of. At the memorial service, I was sitting between Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens) and Steve Wynn, the casino billionaire. Afterwards, I walked out in Louisville and there were all these people who looked like they had just come from the burning bush. They wanted to share stories of how they had met Ali at Chicago’s O’Hare airport in 1966 or whatever. I got talking to a few of those people. One or two had ended up going to lunch with him. That’s what he was like. If anyone had gone up to his door even six months ago, if he felt OK, he would have invited you in, fed you a meal, just like he did with me those years ago. If his grandkids were there, he would have insisted you played with them, and finally you would have stayed the night. He did that every day, and a lot of those people turned up to his memorial, not just to be there, but because they felt they knew him."}

Although US sports do not have the same reputation for violence as some of the more dangerous parts of European and South American soccer, there would be obvious concerns about allow firearms into venues with alcohol and where passions can ignite. The Seahawks have the lowest arrest rate in the NFL, with 0.8 arrests per game. The San Diego Chargers have the highest, with 24.6 arrests per game – although that figure is partly influenced by the team’s zero-tolerance policy. The bill is likely to face strong opposition in Washington, a state with a strong Democratic base."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":843,"title":"WHY SPORT’S ZERO-TOLERANCE STANCE ON PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS IS WRONG","class":1,"body":"In 1913, Eugene Christophe cheated in the Tour de France. A race vehicle crashed into him, causing his front forks to snap. Instead of repairing them by himself, he cheated by having a small boy pump the bellows for him while he melded them in the local blacksmith’s fire. He broke the rule of the time that dictated the cyclist himself had to repair his own bike. Of course, today that is not cheating at all. When Johnny Hoogerland (Vacansoleil) was thrown into a fence by a media car during the 2011 Tour de France, his team was able to replace his broken bike. He carried on, bandaged up by race medics as he went. And this year, when Chris Froome was the victim of a race motorbike driving too close in crowded conditions, he went up to the line of current rules by running with his bike while a replacement could not reach him. He went onto win the overall race again, of course. The values behind the original rule were reasonable: pitting one man and his machine against another, limiting the effect of wealth in providing mechanics and replacement bikes, and so on. And as every weekend warrior knows the faster the bike, the more it punctures and cracks. There is a tactical trade-off to be made. But there is nothing wrong with the rules today either. They limit the extent to which mechanicals and incompetent race vehicles decide the race, and focus the result on the rider himself in his struggle to be the best. Those are also reasonable values, and ones which many would agree are fairer for the athlete, and more interesting for the spectator. So why do we cling to our zero-tolerance rule for performance-enhancing drugs? The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) claims that this rule embodies the spirit of sport, which it expresses as a list of values: But instead, the rule has led to intrusive and prurient invasion into athletes’ bodies and lives, with humiliating testing protocols and leaked medical data. It has led to widespread mistrust and scapegoating: when the rules on meldonium changed at the beginning of the year, Maria Sharapova was infamously caught out for using it, but WADA allowed an amnesty for lower doses after 172 athletes tested positive for the drug. Rules are frequently enforced patchily because applying them systematically and thoroughly would be unaffordable. One estimate put the figure at $30,000-40,000 AUD ($22,440-29,920) per athlete per year. Testing labs have often appeared incompetent, with Rio, Beijing and Doha labs all recently suspended. Recent reports into Russia proved what we all knew: that there is no level playing field in testing worldwide. Some athletes know they will not be caught by their agency, others take the wrong over-the-counter supplement and get pilloried. I have argued for a new set of rules, based on a new set of values. Those values are athlete safety, and maintenance of the human test. By this I mean that we should ban substances that are risky to athletes, and which mean that the resulting performance significantly loses its human element. This might depend on the sport: a beta blocker might be inappropriate for an archery competition where nerves of steel are part of the test but fine for a weightlifter who gets a little nervous in large crowds. It might also limit the extent of doping rather than the type. If a cyclist improves his blood values by altitude training or by the drug EPO, the outcome is the same, as long as it does not go too far (beyond normal physiological limits) and become dangerous or super-human. We could then focus our limited resources on values that matter. The rules of sport are designed to protect the athlete and to build a structure within which we can have some confidence of a deserving winner, whose talents in a certain area have been tested against the others. They will always be somewhat arbitrary: on December 31 2015, when Sharapova took her meldonium, it was legal. The next day it was not. Australian modern pentathlete Alex Watson was banned for taking caffeine, whereas Chris Hoy brought his own coffee machine to the London Olympics. But if we created an independent body, with a smaller, tighter remit to prevent doping that went beyond the natural physiological limits, or otherwise risked athletes’ health, we would be providing athletes with a framework they can build on instead of a martyrs’ pyre."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":844,"title":"India v England: Ravichandran Ashwin seals series win in Mumbai","class":1,"body":"England subsided to an innings-and-36-run defeat on the final day of the fourth Test in Mumbai as India swiftly sealed a series victory. Resuming on 182-6 - still 49 behind - England's final four wickets fell in 48 balls, with Ravichandran Ashwin taking 6-55 for match figures of 12-167. It is only the third time a Test side has made 400 or more in their first innings and then lost by an innings. India, 3-0 up with one match to play, have now won five consecutive series. The world number ones are unbeaten in 18 matches at home, winning 15 of those, a run that dates back to England's 2-1 series win in 2012. For Alastair Cook's side, a fourth defeat in five matches is their seventh of the year - their 12-month worst of eight losses could be equalled in the fifth and final Test, which begins in Chennai on Friday. In defeats in the second and third Tests, England were punished for batting collapses. Here, they were outclassed, and not helped by their team selection or the shortcomings of their squad. Both Joe Root and James Anderson admitted the tourists were wrong to chose four pacemen and only two spinners on a pitch that assisted the slow bowlers more than any other in the series. Still, their options were limited. Of the travelling squad, off-spinner Gareth Batty had a poor third Test, left-arm spinner Liam Dawson is uncapped and batsmen Gary Ballance and Ben Duckett are out of form. The selection problems were compounded by errors from the tourists in Mumbai. After winning the toss, England found themselves 220-2 but lost their last eight wickets for 180 runs. Then, with chosen spinners Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali disappointing, England missed chances off Virat Kohli, Murali Vijay and Jayant Yadav, who made a double century and two hundreds between them as India racked up a massive 631. Realistically, a different England XI or squad is unlikely to have made a great deal of difference. In these conditions, India are vastly superior. If the pitch in the next Test is going to be like this, you can open the bowling with James Anderson and Ben Stokes. You need an extra spinner and an extra batsman. I don't care who you leave out. You don't pick Stuart Broad because he's good bowler and he's fit, or Chris Woakes because he's had a fantastic year. I would send for another batsman from the Lions. All Gary Ballance has had is nets and drinks, the kid must be soul destroyed. He should be sent home. Ben Duckett isn't good enough when it turns. he's a one-day player. If you're not confident in them, let them go home. The last person they got from the Lions, Keaton Jennings, got a hundred in this match. England's spinners aren't as good as India's, but England's batting hasn't been good enough either. They don't have the patience to bat long enough, to play low-risk strokes. They have lots of boundaries options, but not enough in terms of defence. Every time England are putting a partnership together, there's a lot of risk. England have been hammered. You can make up excuses, to say that Virat Kohli is only good in theses conditions, but that is nonsense. On a turning pitch and facing the expertise, accuracy and sleight of hand of off-spinner Ashwin and left-armer Ravindra Jadeja, the best England could have hoped for was to avoid an innings defeat. That wish evaporated in an eight-over blur of high-quality spin bowling that, at times, was close to unplayable. The masterful Ashwin's best trick was his first, a beautifully disguised carrom ball turning the other way to deceive Jonny Bairstow, who missed by some distance and was trapped lbw for 51. After that, the end came quickly. Chris Woakes was bowled through the gate playing a drive, Adil Rashid flicked to deep mid-wicket and last man James Anderson was caught at mid-on. Overall, taking in the fourth evening, Ashwin finished the match with five wickets for six runs in the space of 25 deliveries."}

{"id":846,"title":"How Phil Jones has become Manchester United's defensive mainstay - Phil Neville","class":1,"body":"It is not so long ago that Phil Jones was becoming Manchester United's forgotten man but he showed again in Sunday's 1-0 win over Tottenham that he can be the mainstay of their back four. Injuries meant he did not play for United's first team from 2 January until the start of November and, in that time, they signed Eric Bailly, and also used Daley Blind, Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo at centre-back. I was left wondering where Jones would fit into Jose Mourinho's plans when he returned to fitness. His ability and potential were not in doubt but his problem was the same as it often has been since he joined United aged 19 in 2011 - a lack of consistency, either in staying fit or in playing in one position for a sustained period. Jones was at the point in his career where he had to play, and deliver. So far, he is doing both. The time to assess him fully on that will be at the end of the season but, since coming back into the team, he has been in absolutely unbelievable form. What we are seeing now are the benefits of him being given the same role in the centre of defence and, over the past seven games, he has proved that he has the ability to become United's number one centre-back. In the past there were always the accusations that Jones was a little bit rash - that he would dive into silly tackles and get himself injured. But I have not seen that since he has come back into the team and there seems to be a bit more maturity to his game. What has also helped him is having a regular partner at the back, and being part of a settled back four. Throughout his managerial career, once Mourinho finds a defensive combination that works then he doesn't seem to change it. At United, Matteo Darmian is his equivalent of Cesar Azpilicueta at Chelsea - a right-footed left-back - and Antonio Valencia has probably been one of the best right-backs in the Premier League this season. Mourinho has found a partnership that works in the centre too, with Jones and Marcos Rojo. The beauty of that is that they are a right and left-footed pairing and I also like the way they concentrate on defending and winning their duels rather than hitting 60 or 70-yard passes or dribbling out from the back. It works. You cannot say they have not been tested together yet because they have come up against three of the best strikers in the league in the past few weeks. Jones and Rojo kept Harry Kane completely quiet on Sunday, the same as they handled Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez and Everton's Romelu Lukaku, and they stopped all three of them from scoring. Bailly is going away to the Africa Cup of Nations, which starts on 14 January, with Ivory Coast and he is going to find it really difficult to get back in the United team before then. Apart from him not playing at the moment, however, I think Mourinho feels he has found his best team with the line-up that faced Everton and Spurs. They look strong at the back and they have got a fantastic balance in midfield with players who can win the ball and use it. A big part of that is Ander Herrera, who has been absolutely outstanding. He does not have the flair or Pogba or the class of Carrick but having him in the team makes both of them better. Herrera is the type that you don't know the true value of until you play or work with him because, from the outside, it may not appear that he scores or makes enough goals, or plays the killer passes. But I would describe him as United's fireman because he is always exactly where he is needed on the pitch. He set up United's winner against Tottenham but, quietly and efficiently, he did a lot more than that. He covered more ground than any other player, made the most interceptions and tackles and, if you look at his touch map, then he touched the ball in every area of the pitch. You can almost say to him 'you go wherever there is trouble, and sort it out'. He is not only a tough player, because of his background at Athletic Bilbao, he is a clever one too. Yes, Sunday's win over Spurs was only United's second in the past nine league games but some of the criticism of Mourinho has been getting over their form is very unfair. They only lost one game during that time and people were trying to look at their draws as disasters when they were nothing of the sort. People might say I am biased as an ex-United player but I am just saying 'look at things from a balanced point of view'. United are sixth in the Premier League, into the last 32 of the Europa League and in the semi-finals of the EFL Cup. That is no disaster. Last week's performance at Everton was probably their poorest in the past couple of months but generally, I have been watching them and thinking they are heading in the right direction. After watching their draw with Arsenal on 19 November I thought this was a much-improved United team with a system that worked. They look like they are going to attack, create chances and score goals. Not only that, they play an exciting and attractive style of football that I associate with United and one that, as a fan for 39 years, I want to see when I go to Old Trafford. Mourinho deserves credit for that, not criticism. Phil Neville was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":847,"title":"Garth Crooks' team of the week: De Gea, Bellerin, Mkhitaryan, Vardy, Costa, Zaha","class":1,"body":"There were goals galore, with champions Leicester putting four past Pep Guardiola's Manchester City and Watford and Burnley both scoring three times in their wins over Everton and Bournemouth respectively. Hull and Crystal Palace shared six goals while Swansea scored three in a much-needed win over Sunderland. Arsenal moved top on Saturday by beating Stoke, before Chelsea saw off West Brom a day later to regain the summit. Manchester United and Southampton both claimed narrow wins against Tottenham and Middlesbrough, before Liverpool and West Ham played out a thrilling draw. My team is at the top of this page. Why not pick your own from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists, and share it with your friends? Pick your XI from our list and share with your friends. The save from Christian Eriksen's free-kick was first class but it wasn't my favourite. The save I thought was immense came in the first half when De Gea was confronted by every goalkeeper's nightmare as the Spain international suddenly couldn't see the ball. In his keenness to set up his defensive wall, he found himself scampering across his line to save what would have been a certain goal. What made the save even better was the fact that the free-kick picked up pace as the ball spun off the turf. To put these saves into perspective, you had to see the relief on the faces of the Manchester United players, not to mention manager Jose Mourinho. It would appear the boys at Old Trafford are starting to feel the pressure. Well, Irish eyes must be smiling in Lancashire after two goals by Irishmen and three well-earned points for Burnley. Jeff Hendrick got the stunning opener but Stephen Ward provided the goal that gave the Clarets a little breathing space in what became a stifling encounter. What impressed me most about Ward's goal was the speed of his reaction. Artur Boruc did well to make the save but Ward was on the rebound like a cobra to make it 2-0. However, I continue to be slightly bemused by managers. Sean Dyche felt that football is a time trial and the whistle must be blown in line with the time added board. Players play until the whistle. The time added is an indicator for the referee, and players continue to do their job until the referee blows for time. It's not the referee's fault if they can't defend in the meantime. I have always thought highly of this defender, especially his competitive qualities. He reminds me of his compatriot and 1978 World Cup-winning captain Daniel Passarella - relatively small in stature but a giant in the battle. Rojo can play anywhere across the back four, but I like him at centre-back where he can attack the ball and the man if necessary. Manchester United never heard a peep out of Tottenham's Harry Kane and that was all down to Rojo. Nine wins on the trot for the Blues suggest a Premier League title could be calling for Gary Cahill and his team-mates once more. The Chelsea captain was superb against a disciplined and well-organised West Brom side - a point Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola might want to consider. It was obvious that David Luiz was still suffering from the effects of last week's appalling challenge from Sergio Aguero. The Brazilian was determined to play but needed some care and attention at the back, and he got it from his skipper. Cahill covered everything and took charge of a situation that normally Luiz would have handled. Another clean sheet for Chelsea and a captain's performance by Cahill. When Hector Bellerin plays for Arsenal they tend to win. His quality of pass is so good when he is in the final third of the pitch, it's quite impressive. The substitute had only been on the pitch for a few minutes, having come back from injury, and he was causing Stoke all kinds of problems down the right. The full-back then produced the most wonderful ball for Theo Walcott to equalise and almost immediately set up a chance for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who should have done better. Bellerin is a fabulous talent and earned his place in the Arsenal team. As for Stoke, it was a valiant effort with notable performances particularly from Joe Allen and Charlie Adam. However Adam needs to be careful. He caught Alexis Sanchez with a nasty clip as he played a one-two with Alex Iwobi for Arsenal's third goal. He got away with what might have been interpreted as an clumsy error by some, but a stamp by others who know what actually takes place on a football field. Adam got away with it this time but it might cost him and his team in the future. This lad is capable of unbelievable things, the only problem is you don't know when the unbelievable is going to happen. Against Hull he was unplayable. You sensed something special was going on when he danced around three players, got in on goal and missed the target but what took place thereafter was just sensational as he almost single-handedly took Hull apart. He was brought down for Crystal Palace's penalty and assisted in their equaliser. But the moment to savour was Zaha's goal because it was special. The draw was the least Palace deserved after a shameful dive in the box by Hull's Robert Snodgrass, and two penalty appeals turned down by referee Michael Jones. Both of the challenges were on Christian Benteke, the second of which looked more like an assault than a foul. Thank goodness Zaha is capable of producing the occasional performance like this. I suppose if he did this every week, he'd be playing for Real Madrid and not Crystal Palace. What a goal. The control was a bit special but the quality of the finish just blew me away. He said in his post-match interview that he wants to score goals - well he won't score many better goals in his career than his strike against Bournemouth. However, it wasn't just the goal that set Hendrick's performance apart from the rest, but his overall contribution. On another day he might have had a penalty when Harry Arter bundled Hendrick over in the box and it again showed that the player has a healthy nose for sniffing out goals. I was as surprised as anyone to see Henrikh Mkhitaryan find it so difficult to get into this Manchester United side. I had observed his talents when he was at Borussia Dortmund and thought what an excellent signing. His performance in the opening game of the season proved again that the Premier League is no stroll in the park, and the player paid the price for not starting well. However, this week has proved a great success for the Armenia international. His goal and performance in the Europa League demonstrated what he is capable of and against Spurs he looked even more impressive. What a pity that such a poor tackle by Tottenham's Danny Rose robbed the best player on the pitch from finishing a match he seem to control from the start. Three brilliantly taken goals by Jamie Vardy made Manchester City look less than ordinary. Vardy was back to his predatory best and I can't make up my mind which of his goals I enjoyed the most - his first, which he rifled past Claudio Bravo into the side of the net? Or his third, which he screwed over the line from what appeared an impossible angle? However, what is most disturbing about this encounter was Manchester City's attitude. When is Pep Guardiola going to take the Premier League seriously? How on earth the Manchester City boss expected go to the King Power Stadium with such a cavalier approach to their defensive responsibilities I can't imagine. What did Guardiola expect? That Leicester would be so intimidated by the reputation of City's attacking flair they would be scared stiff? Well, we saw what Vardy and his team-mates thought of that notion, didn't we? They absolutely shredded Manchester City in 30 minutes and it was nothing less than the visitors deserved for displaying such arrogance. I hated this player last season and now I am starting to love him. What a finish, what a performance and what a victory for Chelsea. One goal was always going to decide this fixture and it was a simple matter of who was going to make the first mistake. Unfortunately for West Brom, it was Gareth McAuley, who has been outstanding for the Baggies once again this season. He let Diego Costa in on a pass he had no right to win and what then took place was quite extraordinary. Costa, having won what appeared to be a lost cause, took aim from the most acute angle and curled a sensational shot into the top corner. Costa seems to be putting all his efforts into his game and seems to be less concerned with setting fires all over the pitch. His first goal was just fabulous and his second wasn't bad either. Stefano Okaka has found adjusting to life in the Premier League quite demanding, having been delayed by injury. However, his manager has persevered with the striker, which has been fortunate for Walter Mazzarri with Odion Ighalo suffering from second-season syndrome. This was Everton's fourth successive away league defeat and I can't remember when I have seen such abject defending on set plays. I have said it before, something is not quite right at Goodison Park and they need to fix it quickly."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":848,"title":"Henrikh Mkhitaryan: Manchester United midfielder out with ankle injury","class":1,"body":"Manchester United midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan has been ruled out until Boxing Day after injuring his ankle in their 1-0 win over Tottenham. The 27-year-old Armenian was fouled by Spurs right-back Danny Rose and after lengthy treatment was taken off on a stretcher in the 85th minute. United manager Jose Mourinho said it was not a serious injury. It looks like next match not, but not needing surgery. Hopefully we have him for Boxing Day, Mourinho told MUTV. Mourinho was initially afraid the injury was serious but said he would be without him for a maximum of a couple of weeks. He will miss Wednesday's trip to Crystal Palace and Saturday's match at West Bromwich Albion but should be back for the Premier League match at home to Sunderland on 26 December. Mkhitaryan's winner against Tottenham was his first Premier League goal for United and his first at Old Trafford. It came on the back of his first for the club in last week's 2-0 win over Zorya Luhansk in the Europa League. Mkhitaryan was signed for £26m from Borussia Dortmund in the summer but had been left out of United's first team until recently. Mourinho urged more of United's squad to follow the example shown by the creative midfielder. He crossed the line to be a better player, Mourinho told Sky Sports He crossed the line mentally, that others have to cross. I want more from some of my attacking players. For a player like him who spends time working and working it means a lot. Not just the way he's creating but his defensive participation in the team. Mourinho said he wanted to dedicate this victory to Marouane Fellaini in his post-match interview. The Belgium midfielder, who gave away a late penalty in the Red Devils' 1-1 draw with Everton last weekend, was jeered by some United fans while he warmed up as a substitute on the touchline at Old Trafford. I am dedicating the victory to Marouane because in the last match, it was him who was involved in the loss of two points, Mourinho said. That's why I want to make it clear he's an important player for me. Mourinho added that the Old Trafford crowd can do what they want and he cannot complain because they are phenomenal with us."}

England, who spent 14 hours in the field, then slipped to 182-6 at stumps, trailing the hosts by 49 runs. When the ball is flying you need to be led by the bowlers and we didn't have that, Anderson told Sky Sports. It was probably our worst morning of the whole tour from a bowling point of view and control. We were clawing it back from there. England's bowlers were easily negotiated by Kohli, who struck 26 boundaries including one six as the spinners finished with combined figures of 8-397 from 118.3 overs. You feed off his energy and his mindset. It was a great innings, Jayant said of Kohli's innings. The tourists' reply began poorly as Keaton Jennings fell for a golden duck, before Alastair Cook was trapped lbw for 18 and Moeen Ali edged to leg gully for a two-ball duck. Jonny Bairstow's half-century gave England some hope but Ben Stokes and nightwatchman Jake Ball were both dismissed inside the final four overs. We have to be positive.

BBC Sport takes a look at the quirkiest and more interesting statistics from the weekend. After 29 goals were registered across Saturday's six games, stats fans were purring in anticipation at the prospect of a record-breaking weekend of goal action. Alas, three 1-0 wins on Sunday let the side down, before Liverpool's 2-2 draw with West Ham left a final sting in the tail. That meant there were 36 goals in total over the weekend - seven short of the Premier League record of 43 set between 5 and 6 February 2011 (since the league was reduced from 22 to 20 teams in 1995). But there is still hope for the goal fanatics out there - this season is on course to be the highest scoring in the era of a 20-team Premier League. There have been 434 goals from 150 games this term and if the scoring continues at its current rate, it will reach 1,098 by the time the 380th and final game is played in May. The record to beat is 1,066 from 2011-12. And when you take the average number of goals per game, this season's average of 2.89 - if maintained - would be the highest in Premier League history. Oldham Athletic stayed up and Crystal Palace went down, while Ian Rush, John Barnes, Teddy Sheringham and Peter Ndlovu were all on the scoresheet. Ace of Base were in the top 10. When are we talking about? The final day of the 1992-93 season - 8 May 1993. That is how far back you have to go to find the last time six home teams scored three goals on the same day in the Premier League. It happened again on Saturday when Watford, Arsenal, Burnley, Hull, Swansea and Leicester all put three goals past their visitors. For those of you old enough to remember 1993, here's a trip down memory lane.

{"id":851,"title":"European Rugby Champions Cup: Wasps 32-17 Connacht","class":1,"body":"Kurtley Beale scored a try with his first touch before receiving a yellow card on his Wasps debut as his side beat Connacht in the European Champions Cup to go top of Pool Two. Beale went over after seven minutes but was then punished for a high tackle. Connacht were in the game up until Joe Launchbury scored the third of Wasps' four tries, Nathan Hughes and Josh Bassett also going over for the hosts. Kieran Marmion and Rory Parata scored tries for Connacht. However, Jack Carty missed two penalties as the Irish club were beaten in Europe for the first time this season. Wasps, who started the day two points behind Pool Two leaders Connacht, are now three points ahead of them after the bonus-point win. They have scored a total of 17 tries in their first three European games. Australia international Beale agreed to join Wasps on 13 May, but suffered a serious knee injury less than a day later which delayed his debut for his new club. However, the 27-year-old made up for lost time as he produced an outstanding display in an incident-packed debut. He spun out of a collision with Stacey Ili before stretching over the line to score the game's first points before being shown a yellow card for a high tackle on Niyi Adeolokun. Beale was also heavily involved in the build-up to tries from Launchbury and Bassett. Connacht had beaten Toulouse and hammered Zebre in their opening two games in this season's competition. Yet they failed to take the lead at any time in what was a physical and sometimes breathless game. Marmion spotted a considerable gap around the forward fringes and sprinted clear to score an opportunist try before replacement Parata's touchdown after a clever interception. Wasps were tested defensively, while Connacht showed spirit to come back from 10-3 down to draw level before moving to within three points of the hosts after trailing 20-10. Yet they could find no way back as Launchbury and Bassett went over in the final quarter to kill the game. What a way to introduce yourself to the fans of Wasps. Kurtley Beale will score many, many prettier tries than the one he scored today but he had a smile from ear to ear when he went over. As for his yellow card, I was amazed. There was no swing of an arm. It surprised me. What's next in Pool Two? All eyes will be on Galway next Saturday (17:30 GMT) as Connacht get a chance to avenge this defeat in the return game. Wasps director of rugby Dai Young on Kurtley Beale being sin-binned for a high tackle: I think there would be a big fine around the corner if I really said what I really thought. There were obstacles in the game, and the referee's interpretation was one we had to battle with.

{"id":852,"title":" Nationals catcher finds perfect way to repurpose his broken bats ","class":1,"body":"In an ideal world, baseball players wouldn’t have to improvise at all. Think about it. For the most part, players are creatures of habit. They eat the same meal before each game. They try to follow the same exact pattern during a hot streak. They read and follow scouting reports. When one of those aspects is slightly different, it can throw some players off their game. That’s not going to be the case with Washington Nationals catcher Spencer Kieboom. When faced with a recent challenge, Kieboom proved he was able to go off script in order to solve the problem. Now that’s smart thinking. Kieboom may not have had any logs to start a fire in his fireplace, but he was willing to improvise. Instead of going out in the cold and chopping up some fresh wood, he did the next best thing: Grabbed a bunch of his broken bats. It’s not only wise, but it’s also a good way to avoid going outside in inhospitable temperatures and doing physical labor. We’re so proud. While we applaud the move, there’s a part of us that wants to say: Think of the collectors! A number of fans are looking at this picture crying their eyes out right now. It’s not easy to get your hands on a game-used major-league bat, and many would kill to add one of these to their collection. But, hey, desperate times call for desperate measures. You have to stay warm in the cold, winter months somehow. Kieboom gets points for creativity here, even if it seemed like the obvious thing to do."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":853,"title":" Five reasons Michigan State is off to a disappointing start this season","class":1,"body":"Sunday’s 81-73 upset at the hands of unheralded Northeastern was Michigan State’s fifth loss already this season. The other four came against national powers Arizona, Kentucky, Baylor and Duke, but this one raised more eyebrows considering the Huskies have lost to the likes of Cornell, Boston University and Stony Brook already this season. With a 7-5 record and only one quality win against Wichita State, Michigan State will have less margin for error entering Big Ten play this season than in previous years. Here’s a look at four issues that have plagued the Spartans so far this season: 1. Injuries have depleted Michigan State’s frontcourt. Few teams have been decimated by injuries worse than Michigan State, which is down three key members of its frontcourt. UNLV transfer Ben Carter will miss the entire season with a knee injury. Projected starting center Gavin Schilling also suffered a knee injury that could cost him the entire season too. And star freshman forward Miles Bridges has missed Michigan State’s last four games with an ankle injury suffered Nov. 29 against Duke. The result is a Michigan State starting lineup featuring four guards and 6-foot-6 former preferred walk-on Kenny Goins at center. Goins and 6-8 freshman Nick Ward will be the only healthy true big men on the roster even after Bridges returns from injury early in Big Ten play. While Ward has done a surprisingly credible job providing interior scoring and protecting the rim, Michigan State’s lack of size has been costly on the glass, typically one of the Spartans’ greatest areas of strength. They’re 189th in offensive rebounding percentage nationally and merely above average on the defensive glass. 2. In retrospect, the November schedule was too tough. While Michigan State has drawn praise in the past for its tough non-conference slates, this year’s was probably too difficult. Before the calendar turned to December, the Spartans played five games against KenPom Top 30 opponents — all away from East Lansing. The gauntlet began with a one-point loss to Arizona in Honolulu. Four days and six time zones later, the Spartans were routed by Kentucky in New York. Then came the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, which featured the likes of Louisville, Baylor, VCU and Wichita State. And as if that’s wasn’t enough, Michigan State fell at Duke on Nov. 29. Michigan State would have held its own against that formidable schedule most years, but the Spartans were too young and too injury-plagued this season. Izzo even acknowledged as much a few weeks ago when he apologized to his team for giving it more than it could handle. 3. Eron Harris hasn’t been consistent enough. As Michigan State tried to rally against Northeastern on Sunday night, its second leading scorer remained on the bench. Tom Izzo chose not to play Eron Harris during the final five minutes because he wasn’t satisfied with the senior’s defense or shot selection. You want to know why he didn’t play? Izzo told reporters in East Lansing. He didn’t guard. He didn’t play very hard. He didn’t play very smart. He took a couple bad shots and he wasn’t playing the way he has to play. If Harris doesn’t do that this week, he won’t be playing this week, either. This has been a constant issue for Harris in his two years at Michigan State. For every 31-point performance against Florida Gulf Coast or 20-point outburst against Tennessee Tech, there’s a 1-for-9 shooting night against Baylor or a game where his lack of defense gets him benched against Kentucky. The bottom line with Harris is that he cannot be counted on as a go-to threat on a consistent basis. He can be an effective complementary scorer who provides instant offense from time to time, but he probably won’t ever evolve into the alpha dog and senior leader Michigan State hoped he would become. 4. Tom Izzo needs to trust his freshman point guard. It’s easy to see why Izzo would opt for experience over talent at point guard to start the season. While veteran LouRawls Nairn isn’t the dynamic playmaker Cassius Winston is, he was far less prone to turnovers or defensive lapses.But the way Winston has improved over the past six weeks, the time has come for Izzo to empower his freshman by making him Michigan State’s starting point guard. Winston scored 21 points and dished out 10 assists in the Northeastern loss, the best performance of his college career so far. In his three previous games, Winston had a combined 27 assists and only five turnovers despite coming off the bench and playing a modest 23 minutes per game. The importance of Winston’s ability to create off the dribble is amplified in Miles’ Bridges absence. Nobody else on the Michigan State roster is as adept at creating scoring chances for himself or others. You could perhaps see a shift in Izzo’s thinking during the Northeastern game as Winston logged a career-high 33 minutes. He was in Michigan State’s starting lineup for the second half and even logged nine minutes playing off ball alongside Nairn. 5. Michigan State’s free throw shooting must improve. More than a third of the way into the season, Michigan State is still leaving a lot of points at the charity stripe. The Spartans are shooting 61.4 percent from the foul line, 333rd best nationally. The biggest problem is that Ward is getting to the foul line about twice as frequently as any of his teammates, but he has only sunk 32 of 60 free throws. What’s more confusing is that Bridges is also shooting just over 50 percent from the free throw line, while Winston and Harris have both missed a fair number of foul shots too."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":854,"title":" Chase for the Championship Is NASCAR's Electoral College ","class":1,"body":"Once upon a time, chill’ren, the NASCAR season ended by crowning a champion that had actually won the championship with a season’s worth of performance, starting at Daytona and ending at the other end of Florida, at Homestead. A driver and team earned points for every race, and those points were added up at the end of the season, and the most points won. But that was judged anticlimactic and not TV-friendly, and the Chase for the Championship was developed, which indeed increased late-season interest in NASCAR. But it did not, critics suggest, crown a true champion. This year, in fact, it crowned the driver who had the best restart after the last caution flag, which was Jimmie Johnson, winning him his seventh title. We could have substituted earning for winning, but that would suggest the aforementioned season-long performance by Johnson and his crew. Which didn’t happen, and will never happen again. Whether you prefer the Chase or the pre-Chase, or the popular vote or the Electoral College, likely depends on whether your candidate won. As with the pop vote or the EC, one person won one, one won the other. Same with the Chase and pre-Chase. And thanks to the statistics fans at Jayski.com, here’s the top five drivers under the Chase format, and the top five under the pure points system, if it still existed: In the Chase: 1, Jimmie Johnson. 2, Joey Logano. 3, Kyle Busch. 4, Carl Edwards. 5, Matt Kenseth.

On Sunday in Houston, Osweiler’s rocky ride as the Texans’ quarterback hit a brick wall, as Osweiler was yanked from the game against Jacksonville and replaced with backup Tom Savage. Houston signed Osweiler in the offseason to a gargantuan $72 million contract, but he has been nothing short of wretched all season long. On Sunday, playing the woeful two-win Jaguars, Osweiler threw two interceptions. That was enough for head coach Bill O’Brien, who gave Osweiler the hook with more than eight minutes remaining in the second quarter. As Savage entered the game, the Houston crowd unleashed a full-throated cheer. Teammates on the Texans sideline slapped Osweiler on the shoulder pads in encouragement, and in the huddle, Lamar Miller motioned for the bellowing crowd to quiet down. Savage proceeded to march the Texans 75 yards down to the goal line, where more strangeness awaited. Akeem Hunt proceeded to fumble the ball going across the goal line, and there was no clear indication of which team recovered it. Two plays later, Savage and the Texans fell short on fourth down, but managed to nab a safety on Jacksonville’s ensuing possession. The Tom Savage Extravaganza is off to a suitably weird start."}

Versatile receiver/quarterback Terrelle Pryor is one of them. Despite being currently in line to become a free agent in March, Pryor is planning to finish out the season despite an injury in his finger. Citing a source, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported Monday that Pryor has ligament damage, while longtime Browns beat writer Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland Plain-Dealer, also citing a source, wrote it’s possible Pryor has damage and will undergo an MRI and seek a second opinion. Either way, Pryor plans to play in the final two games of the season, and get the finger repaired once the Browns are done for the year. According to Cabot, the sprain is in a knuckle and affected the 27-year old in the second half of Sunday’s game against the Buffalo Bills; Pryor was targeted eight times, but had just four receptions, for 19 yards. He dropped one pass at the Bills’ 5-yard line. Pryor leads Cleveland with 67 receptions for 877 yards and four touchdowns. He also has completed 5-of-9 passes for 41 yards and has eight carries for 21 yards and a touchdown. There were reports in October that Pryor’s agent and the Browns had engaged in preliminary contract extension talks, but nothing was finalized.

This is the point where some readers will perk up, sit straight up in their chairs, and go straight to the comments section to tell me how stupid and wrong that I am because other general managers won't want to deal with the Padres due to the medical records scandal which earned Preller a month-long vacation suspension. Phooey, says I (not really, but I do think I should start incorporating stuff like phooey and says I into the rotation of stupid things I say). Since returning to work, Preller has already executed a few trades, which pokes a hole into that balloon full of hot air. Maybe opposing general managers are a tad more cautious when dealing with him, but even that seems a bit much. I could be way off base, but I have assumed all along that every team does some form of what the Padres were doing, albeit less brazenly blatantly and to a lesser extent. But aside from that, this is the point where Preller should throw deposed team president Mike Dee so far under the bus that nary a spot of sunshine can glisten off his bare scalp. When the team's keeping of two sets of medical records came to light, I immediately figured the plan had Dee's greasy fingerprints all over it. Even if somehow Dee had nothing to do with it because he was out of touch and shirking his duties, nobody else needs to hear that. I'd be sorely disappointed if Preller didn't approach every opposing general manager by pinning the plan entirely on Dee's slumped shoulders, preferably while shaking his head, referring to Dee as that rat bastard or something similar, and playing up the fact (or what he would have you to believe is a fact) that he, Preller himself, was the biggest victim in the whole affair.

{"id":859,"title":" Manchester City's second-half comeback secures crucial 2-1 win over Arsenal ","class":1,"body":"Leroy Sane canceled out Theo Walcott’s fifth-minute opener just two minutes into the second half. The oft-criticized Raheem Sterling then completed the comeback with a clever left-footed finish. The win vaults City into second place, two points ahead of Arsenal, which now sits in fourth and nine points off the top. The game sprung to life early on when Petr Cech’s simple ball to Hector Bellerin launched an Arsenal counter out of nothing. Bellerin found Sanchez, whose cutting ball into the path of Theo Walcott allowed the English winger to put the Gunners in front. The win vaults City into second place, two points ahead of Arsenal, which now sits in fourth and nine points off the top.The game sprung to life early on when Petr Cech’s simple ball to Hector Bellerin launched an Arsenal counter out of nothing. Bellerin found Sanchez, whose cutting ball into the path of Theo Walcott allowed the English winger to put the Gunners in front. Fault for the goal lies with City’s midfielders. When Cech pounced on a loose ball in his box, the quartet of David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sane and Yaya Toure had advanced into high positions. Both Toure (top of the box) and De Bruyne, however, were in good positions to re-find City’s defensive shape. Inexcusably, they didn’t. De Bruyne put his head down, turned his back and walked back toward his defensive position. Seconds later, he found himself trailing Bellerin, who had received the ball from Cech and subsequently carried it all the way into the attacking half. Toure, meanwhile, was slow to recognize the need to retreat, and even when he did, he retreated with a jog rather than a sprint. That’s why City’s four defenders and defensive midfielder, Fernando, found themselves on the back foot, scrambling to deal with Arsenal as the Gunners suddenly streamed forward with menace. It’s also why Alexis Sanchez, as he prepared to play the piercing pass, had space to do so. City gradually tightened its grasp on the game after conceding, using a similar system to the one that took them to the top of the league in August and September. Their possession grew more sustained. Sterling had a glorious chance to equalize, but his wayward header conjured up thoughts of the suspended Sergio Aguero and what if scenarios. Guardiola’s side was hesitant to press the Gunners high up the field, though. A major reason for the hesitancy was likely missing personnel. Man City was without Fernandinho (suspension) and Ilkay Gundogan (injury, likely season-ending), meaning Fernando and Toure were pressed into duty. Neither possess the covering capabilities to deal with the likes of Mesut Ozil, Sanchez, Walcott and Alex Iwobi. Late in the first half, City became more aggressive without the ball, but was more often than not exposed when it did press. Toure spent more time waving his arms in frustration than hassling Arsenal midfielders. But the second half exploded into life just as the first had. Sane’s brilliant out-to-in run was spotted by Silva — though Sane was perhaps offside — and the 20-year-old German winger rolled his finish in at the near post. When lineups were released an hour before kickoff, many questioned Guardiola’s decision to opt for Sterling up front instead of the club’s only healthy striker, Kelechi Iheanacho. The first half might have turned the questions into criticism. But Guardiola got exactly what he needed from Sane after the break. Any system that employs a false nine, or any sort of unnatural striker who likes to drift wide, requires at least one winger who will pose a threat in central areas. De Bruyne does that, but often in front of the opposition’s defense rather than behind it. Sane’s speed allowed him to pose that threat. He made similar runs from both wings throughout the second half and was a big reason that the home side looked more dangerous going forward. In fact, Sane’s running, coupled with a halftime adjustment from Guardiola, changed the game. De Bruyne was moved into the false nine role, with Sterling and Sane coming in off the wings. The verticality of the wingers’ runs gave Silva and De Bruyne space in between Arsenal’s defensive midfielders and back four. Toure was also much better in a slightly deeper position, and once City dug itself out of the early hole, Toure’s inability to press higher up the field was no longer as much of a problem. With the game tied at one, the Citizens took the initiative and pushed for a second. In the 71st minute, they got it. De Bruyne received a throw-in at midfield near the left touchline, turned and seemingly without looking sprayed a cross-field half volley to Sterling on the right. Sterling carried the ball inside, dragged it onto his left foot and fired it past Cech at the goalkeeper’s near post. Arsenal fans might again feel aggrieved. Silva was in an offside position when Sterling struck his shot, and ended up running across the face of Cech. But with the shot to Cech’s near post, the keeper’s vision was never impeded by Silva’s movement, and thus the correct call was made."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":860,"title":" Manchester City's second-half comeback secures crucial 2-1 win over Arsenal ","class":1,"body":"This isn’t the first time this season that Lillard has publicly called his team on the carpet for poor performance. Last month, after a blowout loss at the hands of James Harden and the Houston Rockets, Lillard summed up the Blazers’ sluggish start to the season by saying, We kind of suck right now. Things haven’t changed much since then; if anything, they’ve only gotten worse, as a team that looked in October like its biggest problem might be just being pretty good has found itself in disappointingly dire straits. All season long, the Blazers have alternated brief bursts of solid play with frustrating stretches and seeming to take two steps back every time they manage to start moving in the right direction. Lillard wasn’t alone in airing the Blazers out — C.J. McCollum called their effort against Golden State unacceptable, and swingman Allen Crabbe termed it embarrassing — but through 29 games, the reality is that such punchless defense has been par for the course in Portland. Under Terry Stotts, Portland has tended toward a conservative defensive style, forsaking cranked-up pressure aimed at disrupting opponents to force turnovers in favor of hanging back, limiting chances at the rim, guarding the 3-point line and trying to force contested 2-point looks. Last year, when the Blazers outpaced many pundits’ expectations by winning 44 games and making the second round of the playoffs, opponents shot 37.1 percent from long-range against them, which was tied for the third-highest percentage in the league. That damage was mitigated, though, by Portland allowing just 22.9 3-point attempts per game, ninth-fewest in the NBA. And while the 2015-16 Blazers didn’t employ a dominant shot-blocker or rim protector, they both kept opponents away from the front of the rim and limited their effectiveness once they got there, finishing tied for 11th among 30 teams in shots allowed within 5 feet of the basket and allowing the league’s fourth-lowest percentage on those looks. Teams aren’t shooting significantly better against the Blazers in those high-value areas this year. Portland’s got the league’s third-best opposing field-goal percentage on attempts within 5 feet, and opponents are up 1 percentage point from last season against Lillard and company from beyond the arc. It’s volume that’s the issue, as the Blazers are giving up nearly three more 3-point shots and two more up-close attempts per night than they did last year. When you compound that slippage by putting opponents on the free-throw line more often — only Phoenix and Memphis have committed more personal fouls per game than the Blazers, and only the Suns have allowed more free throws per game — while forcing turnovers at the league’s sixth-lowest rate, you’ve got the recipe for some ghastly defensive outings. And man, have the Blazers had those this season. Portland has allowed 110 or more points 18 times in 29 games this season, going 4-14 in those games. Raw totals can sometimes obscure the truth of a team’s mettle, since some teams play at faster or slower paces than others, which can inflate or depress score lines … but that’s not the case for the Blazers, who enter Monday’s action allowing an average of 110.4 points per 100 possessions, dead last in the NBA in defensive efficiency. Should they continue conceding at this clip, Stotts’ club would be the first team since the Jay Triano-and-Andrea Bargnani-era Toronto Raptors to finish a season at or above the 110-per-100 mark. (Those Raps did so in both the 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons.) No matter how well you produce points — and behind the shot- and playmaking of Lillard and C.J. McCollum, the Blazers boast the NBA’s eighth-most potent offensive attack — if you hemorrhage buckets like Portland has through failures of focus, communication and connectivity, you’ll struggle to stay in the playoff picture, let alone reach the ranks of real contenders. After losing six of seven, the Blazers now sit at 13-16, just one game ahead of the nondescript Nuggets and two up on the ever-dysfunctional Kings in the race for the No. 8 seed in the West. With summertime signing Festus Ezeli reportedly unlikely to get healthy enough to make the defensive impact that general manager Neil Olshey had hoped for, and an upcoming slate that includes meetings with a slew of high-powered offenses — including another visit to Oracle on Jan. 4 — Portland’s situation seems likely to get worse before it gets better, barring a game-changing acquisition. Even so, Lillard remains optimistic, remembering that before last year’s surprise trip to the conference semifinals, the Blazers had scuffled to an 11-20 start. One great sustained run — like Portland’s 22-8 stretch from Christmas Day 2015 through March 1, 2016 — can change everything. Before the Blazers can catch fire, though, they need a spark; whether Lillard’s ferocious and frank assessment can do the job remains to be seen. In the NBA season, you have hard times. Right now we’re just having a hard time, Lillard said after the game, according to Richman of the Oregonian. As a team we’ve been in worse positions. We got that fight in us. We gotta have it a lot more consistently."}

The coach looked ready for the one-sided first half to end. So were most of the 15,004 in Intrust Bank Arena. With blank looks on their faces, the crowd was stunned — and quieted. Oklahoma State players hopped up and down the floor with a bounce in their step and confidence in their voices. On this night, they were the aggressor. And they did it for 40 minutes in a 93-76 win at the sold-out arena. The Cowboys never trailed and led by as many as 25 points, thanks to hustle plays like Carroll’s, which gave OSU a 49-31 lead with 45 seconds left in the first half. OSU outrebounded Wichita State 13-3 in the first seven minutes and, at halftime, the margin was plus-nine. In the second half, Oklahoma State lit the Shockers up from deep, sinking eight 3-pointers. The Cowboys snapped Wichita State’s 42-game home nonconference winning streak and became the first team to score 80 points against the Shockers in a regulation game since 2009. We’re starting to grow and get better, OSU coach Brad Underwood said. And today was another step. We were better this week than we were last week. And that’s all I can ask for with this basketball team. A year ago, Carroll and Jawun Evans were key players on a team that won just 12 games, with only one of those coming on the road. They took their lumps, dropping five road games by double-digit margins. Saturday night, the junior and sophomore, respectively, were able to sit back and laugh in a room in the bowels of the Wichita arena. Each scored 22 points — Carroll’s matching a career high — and both looked as confident as ever against a team that has reached the past five NCAA Tournaments. Oklahoma State came into the game knowing it needed to take Wichita State out of its element early. The Cowboys did that by crashing the boards and running. A 3-pointer for Evans from the right corner gave OSU a 9-1 lead. At the other end, Lucas N’Guessan blocked a shot. Carroll sped up the floor and Evans fed him the ball in transition, where he was fouled on a dunk attempt. The lead was 10-1 before WSU made its first field goal.It was big, Carroll said of the fast start. Our whole thing was just to stay poised the entire time because they’re going to make their run, so just stay calm the entire game and fight back. The only time the result came into question was with 9:18 left in the first half. That is when Evans picked up his second foul and went to the bench, the Cowboys leading 28-13. It left freshman Brandon Averette running the point. At one point, Wichita State cut the lead to single digits, with Markus McDuffie stealing the ball from McGriff and beating him to the rim for a layup that made it 38-29. But Averette responded by dicing his way inside for a layup. The Cowboys dropped into a zone defense — something Underwood said OSU hasn’t practiced as much — and Oklahoma State went on a mini-run of its own to stretch the lead back to 15. Evans was able to sit the entire 9:18, keeping him fresh and out of foul trouble for the second half. And Oklahoma State’s lead ultimately grew from 15 to 16 without him."}

Twenty-six of their 33 baskets were point-blank shots in the heart of Oklahoma’s sieve-like defense. Gave up a lot of buckets right at the rim, and can’t afford to do that against a really good ballclub, Kruger conceded. Too many at the rim, too many in the paint. We have to do a better job of keeping them out of there. Everything started fine for the Sooners. OU connected on 17 of 21 shots to begin the game — including a stretch of 13 consecutive makes — to create a 40-27 lead with 7:21 left before the half. But from that point, the Sooners only made 18 of their next 52 attempts. While OU tapered offensively, Memphis thrived behind brothers Dedric Lawson (26 points, 12 rebounds) and K.J. Lawson (19 and 13), as well as Jeremiah Martin (25 points) and Markel Crawford (20). Statistics told the story. Those four players all played 40-plus minutes for the American Athletic Conference team and Memphis shot 56.9 percent. The Tigers even did damage on the free-throw line, connecting on 28 of 32 attempts. The Sooners led 47-38 at halftime and kept fighting off comebacks until Martin made two free throws to give the Tigers a 78-77 lead with 56 seconds left in regulation. When they made their run, don’t know if we approached each possession with the energy you have to have to get a stop at that time, Kruger said. We’ve had several leads in the second half where we haven’t maintained them. Have to do a better job of making that play during that run. Making that play, getting that deflection, block, rebound, whatever. Waiting to see who will do that right now. The Sooners (6-4) were energized when Jordan Woodard banked in a 3-pointer with six-tenths of a second remaining to tie the game at 84 and send it into overtime, but Memphis never stopped attacking. Dedric Lawson snapped an 89-all tie with back-to-back baskets and Memphis rolled out of Norman with a big victory. Woodard scored 22 points. Jordan Shepherd — who started his first game — finished with a career-high 18. Christian James (15), Jamuni McNeace (13) and Dante Buford (10) all had strong contributions off the bench. There’s no time for OU to lick its wounds with Big 12 play around the corner. We have to get back to putting in more work, Woodard said. Sure Coach will have us ready for the next game. It’s tough. Big 12 is tough. Big-time basketball. We’ll be ready."}

He recorded three points, including his 18th goal of the season, as the Winnipeg Jets rolled over the floundering Colorado Avalanche by a final score of 4-1. That win pushes the Jets to within a point of the final Wild Card spot in the West.It’s the middle of December, the holiday break is approaching. The Jets are in a spot where they can challenge for a post-season berth. Perhaps the prospect of finishing in the top three in the Central Division is too daunting. Chicago and St. Louis occupy two of the top three spots in that division, and Minnesota — with seven straight wins — could certainly challenge for the Central by the time this season is over. But a Wild Card spot? The Jets are middle of the pack when it comes to scoring, and in the bottom third of the league in goals against, but the notion at least seems possible, especially since teams ahead of them like Calgary and L.A. aren’t exactly lighting up the league right now. I think we’ve shown we can beat teams like Chicago, St. Louis in their home building. That tells something about our team, said Laine. I think we have a really good team and we just have to play our own game every night, and I think we can and we will be a playoff team.

{"id":866,"title":"Milestone night: King Henrik backstops Rangers to shootout win over Devils","class":1,"body":"NEW YORK (AP) Henrik Lundqvist came up big when the New York Rangers needed him and got a key milestone win. Kevin Hayes scored the deciding goal in the shootout and Henrik Lundqvist stopped 29 shots through overtime and three more in the tiebreaker to help the Rangers beat the New Jersey Devils 3-2 Sunday night. Lundqvist stopped Damon Severson in the fourth round of the shootout to secure the Rangers’ sixth win in seven games and second against the Devils at home in eight days. It also gave Lundqvist his 389th career win, tying him with Dominik Hasek for the most by a European-born goaltender. He was an inspiration to me growing up, Lundqvist said about the feat. He was the first guy I saw play paddle down. I grew up watching him, so this special for sure. Lundqvist has been stellar since serving as the backup to Antti Raanta, who started four straight games from Dec. 8-13. In three games since, Lundqvist is 3-0-0 with a 0.98 goals against average and a .967 save percentage. He also made several big stops on Sunday, which included two saves on New Jersey breakaways, to fend off the Devils. Hank is such a competitor. He works so hard, Rangers center Derek Stepan said. He’s an absolute workhorse – a great teammate. And I expected nothing less from him. New York coach Alain Vigneault isn’t surprised by Lundqvist’s recent play. This is the start of my fourth year. As soon as I got here, I knew his preparation and his work ethic in practice, Vigneault said. That’s why he was one of the best goaltenders in the league at that time, and he continues to be. He just works at his game, he’s really focused, and he’s a great person. Mats Zuccarello also scored in the shootout, and Chris Kreider and Derek Stepan had goals in regulation. PA Parenteau and Miles Wood scored and Cory Schneider stopped 24 shots as the Devils lost their sixth straight. Michael Cammalleri had a shootout goal. Things are going to happen in hockey games, Cammalleri said. We aren’t hiding from the fact that we’re on a losing streak and we have to get out of it. Parenteau broke a scoreless tie early in the second with his seventh goal of the season and the Devils on the power play. Parenteau pushed a loose puck underneath Lundqvist and off the post, but the Rangers’ goalie inadvertently hit the puck into the net as he tried to cover it up. The Rangers upped the pressure in the third and after several chances that were stopped by Schneider. New York finally found the back of the net as Mats Zuccarello quickly swung the puck from behind the net to Kreider, who tapped the puck in to even the score at 8:10. The Devils quickly responded to recapture the lead with 9:28 left in the third. Adam Henrique forced Dan Girardi to turn over the puck behind the Rangers’ net, fought off two Rangers players and sent the puck to Wood, who got a quick shot off in front of the net to give the Devils the 2-1 lead. However the Rangers kept pressing and tied it with 1:13 left in regulation as Stepan redirected the puck past Schneider. It’s not the result we wanted so that’s a little frustrating and disappointing, Schneider said. I thought our defending was good here against a really offensive team, but again at the end of the day it’s the two points that matter. Sunday was the final time the Devils will play at Madison Square Garden this season and the loss extended their struggles away from Prudential Center. New Jersey is now 4-11-5 on the road and looking snap their six game skid."}

Henrik Zetterberg told the Detroit Free Press that players were informed about 15 minutes before warm-up that the ice wasn’t ready. We had a feeling pretty early that there probably wouldn’t be a game, but we have to wait to be certain, I guess, he said. The biggest concern was, I think, the safety for the players to go out and play on the ice that wasn’t ready for us. Now, the challenge becomes rescheduling this game. From MLive.com:Under NHL rules, the game couldn’t have started after 9:30, which is 22 hours before the scheduled faceoff time of the Red Wings game Tuesday in Tampa.The game will be made up when the teams can find a date that is convenient for both clubs.

It looked, for the longest time against the Philadelphia Flyers, like the Predators might come away completely empty-handed. But this was an important win for them. A big comeback. The Predators started slow, but began to gain momentum as the game went on. Filip Forsberg finally converted in the third period, eventually sending the game to overtime, before Ryan Ellis won it in the shootout. Nashville came back for a 2-1 win on the road against a team that only recently had a 10-game winning streak snapped. For the Flyers, this will be looked at as an opportunity missed. They had the run of the play for most of this game, but couldn’t beat Pekka Rinne for that all-important second goal. This game had its feisty moments, too. Flyers forward Jakub Voracek took an elbow to the back of the head along the boards early in the third period, causing him to skate slowly to the bench. He did remain in the game, missing only a couple of minutes."}

The official announcement came Monday. The Vancouver Canucks selected Juolevi with the fifth overall pick in this year’s NHL Draft, bolstering the depth among their defensive prospects. Juolevi, 18, saw some playing time during the pre-season in Vancouver, but he was sent back to his junior team in London. At last year’s tournament, Juolevi had nine assists in seven games. His performance there left an impression on Canucks management ahead of the draft. We thought he had an exceptional tournament for a 17-year-old kid, Jim Benning told Sportsnet earlier this year. To step in and help lead his team to a championship… In all my years of scouting, I don’t think I remember a 17-year-old who did what he did this year. We just felt of all the defensemen, we liked his all-around game the best. On Monday, USA Hockey named Minnesota Wild first-round pick Luke Kunin as its captain for the upcoming tournament. Kunin, a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin, was taken 15th overall in this year’s draft. This season, he has 11 goals and 17 points in 16 games. Colin White, an Ottawa Senators first-round pick in 2015, and Charlie McAvoy, taken in the first round of this year’s draft by Boston, were named alternate captains. I couldn’t be happier to have these three quality guys leading this locker room, said U.S. junior head coach Bob Motzko in a statement. We’ve been saying it every day that there’s a pulse with this group. We know Luke, Charlie and Colin are at the center of that through their style of play and their tremendous amount of heart. We’re fortunate to have them leading this team. Wild prospect Joel Eriksson-Ek was named captain of Sweden’s team. Eriksson-Ek already has experience in the NHL regular season, playing nine games in Minnesota, scoring twice with five points, before he was sent back to Sweden."}

The decision comes after the 28-year-old received less than 10 minutes in three of his last five games, including a season-low 8:17 in last Saturday’s 4-2 win over Dallas. It’s been a tough season for Weise overall. He went pointless in his first four games, then received a three-game suspension for a headshot on Anaheim’s Korbinian Holzer. Upon drawing back in, it took him an awfully long time to score his first goal — coming on Nov. 22 — and, after scoring again the following night, has now gone 12 straight games without scoring a point.

Panarin was today named the NHL’s first star of the week, beating out second and third stars, Henrik Lundqvist and Eric Staal, respectively. From the league: Panarin paced the NHL with seven assists and 10 points in four games – all multi-point performances – to help the League-leading Blackhawks (22-8-4, 48 points) stretch their overall winning streak to five contests. He recorded assists on both goals in a 2-1 victory over the New York Rangers Dec. 13. Panarin then posted consecutive three-point efforts, registering 2-1—3 in a 5-4 win over the New York Islanders Dec. 15 and 1-2—3 in a 6-4 triumph over the St. Louis Blues Dec. 17. He capped the week with another two-assist performance in a 4-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks Dec. 18. The 25-year-old Korkino, Russia, native and reigning Calder Memorial Trophy winner ranks fourth in the NHL with 14-20—34 in 34 outings this season. Panarin is a pending restricted free agent who is reportedly asking for at least $6 million per season on a long-term deal. For the ‘Hawks, it’s one of those good problems to have. GM Stan Bowman had hoped to get Panarin locked up over the summer, but there’s been no deal yet."}

The 27-year-old was unable to suit up in Saturday’s 2-1 shootout loss to the New York Rangers because of an upper-body injury, and now it sounds like he’ll miss some more time, according to the Tennessean. Subban didn’t travel with his teammates ahead of their two-game road swing that begins in Philadelphia tonight and concludes in New Jersey tomorrow. He’s been pretty healthy throughout his NHL career. Subban played all 82 games in both 2013-14 and 2014-15 before missing the final 14 games of last year’s regular season because of a neck injury. In his absence, the Preds were forced to shuffle the deck on defense. Mattias Ekholm, who usually plays with Subban, was paired with Petter Granberg, Matt Irwin and Yannick Weber played together and the pairing of Roman Josi and Ryan Ellis remained intact. In his first year with the Predators, Subban has seven goals, 10 assists and a minus-11 rating in 29 games.

Hayes’ goal was his first in seven games and only his second in 28 games this season. Rask recorded his fourth shutout of the year for the Bruins (17-13-1), who had lost two straight games and five of six coming in. Boston was without leading scorer David Pastrnak, who had right elbow surgery Friday. Pastrnak’s 19 goals rank second in the NHL behind Pittsburgh’s Sidney Crosby (21). Peter Budaj had 29 saves for the Kings (16-13-2), who won their previous two games. Los Angeles was outshot 30-18. Colin Miller‘s wrister from the top of the right circle caught a piece of Hayes’ stick and zipped past Budaj 4:20 into the opening period. Hayes was initially credited with an assist on Miller’s goal, but the call was changed. Dominic Moore also assisted on the goal. Hayes has gone 45 games without an assist dating to last Feb. 22.

{"id":875,"title":"Jonathan Drouin is starting to get on a roll for Lightning at just the right time","class":1,"body":"The 2015-16 season was a tumultuous one for Jonathan Drouin and the Tampa Bay Lightning. A trade request, months of drama about whether or not he would ever play for the team again, and constant trade rumors kind of hid the fact we were still dealing with an incredibly talented player that has top-line potential in the NHL. That potential was on display when he eventually returned to the team’s lineup late in the season and into the playoffs when he was arguably one of their best player on the team’s run to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Final. After a slow start this season, one that included an injury that sidelined him for two weeks in November, Drouin has been on a roll for the Lightning over the past week. Including his goal on Saturday night in the Lightning’s shootout loss to the Edmonton Oilers, Drouin now has eight points in his past eight games, including four goals. This hot streak could not come at a better for the Lightning with four top players — Steven Stamkos, Nikita Kucherov, Ondrej Palat and Ryan Callahan — all banged up at the moment and out of the lineup. None of them were in the lineup on Saturday. For as disappointing as this start has been for the Lightning this season they enter Sunday still only two points behind the Ottawa Senators for the third playoff spot in the Atlantic Division. They were in a similar spot exactly one year ago before going on a run that took them deep into the playoffs for the second year in a row. It is going to be a little tougher this year with Stamkos out long-term, but they still have a top-line forward in Drouin that is starting to play at a high level."}

The Detroit Red Wings did, too. Tatar got his first career hat trick, helping Detroit beat the Anaheim Ducks 6-4 on Saturday night to get a desperately needed win with a breakout offensive performance. It’s perfect timing, he said. Tatar got his third goal early in the third period, putting the puck on both sides of his stick before flipping it over John Gibson. Detroit scored more goals (four) in the first two periods than it totaled over its previous four games – all home losses – and finished with a season scoring high. We knew we weren’t good enough the last four games, Tatar said. Detroit has needed Tatar to play better, too. The Czech winger almost matched the number of goals (four) he scored in his first 31 games of the season. Tatar, who made his NHL debut during the 2010-11 season, scored a career-high 29 goals two years ago and had 21 goals last season. Xavier Ouellet scored his first of the season and third of his career with 2:08 left in the second period to put the Red Wings ahead 4-3, their first lead in five games. Petr Mrazek helped Detroit keep the lead, finishing with 21 saves. Anaheim’s Jonathan Bernier stopped 17 shots through two periods before being pulled by Ducks coach Randy Carlyle. He wanted to turn things around and spark the team, Bernier said. Rakell and Shea Theodore scored in the first period, giving the Ducks a 2-0 lead that seemed safe against a team that has been struggling to score. Cam Fowler gave them another two-goal lead early in the second. Tatar, though, pulled Detroit within a goal for the second time, and quickly the Red Wings figured out a way to score. A little luck helped. Tatar shot the puck and it went off the left skate of Fowler, caromed off the end boards and went off the back of Bernier’s left leg and into the net. It’s a tough building when you’re not used to those bounces, Bernier said. Detroit’s Dylan Larkin went to the front of the net and into the crease and was rewarded with a tying goal midway through the second period that stood after a video review and challenge by Carlyle. I thought I was in good position and had it, Bernier said. It trickled in. Rickard Rakell scored his second goal of the game less than two minutes later, pulling Anaheim within a goal. The Red Wings restored their two-goal lead midway through the third when Frans Nielsen scored off a rebound in front of the net.

After a career-high 29 points a year ago for the Islanders, he had 13 points in 29 games this season before the injury. That had him on a pace to set another new career high in scoring, while he had been playing some of his best hockey in recent weeks.

After the game Green insisted that he was OK, but on Sunday morning Red Wings general manager Ken Holland told Mlive.com’s Brendan Savage that Green is probably considered day-to-day at this point, and that the team will know more about his status on Monday. The Red Wings have a back-to-back situation on Monday and Tuesday of this week with games at Tampa Bay and Carolina. Even if it’s nothing long-term losing Green for any length of time would be a problem for a Red Wings team that is already without defensemen Alexey Marchenko and Brendan Smith at the moment. Green has taken on an increased role on the Red Wings blue line this season and is averaging more than 24 minutes of ice time per game, nearly five minutes more than what he played a year ago in his first year with the team after signing a three-year, $18 million contract in free agency. That increased ice time has also resulted in an increase in his point production. It is not quite to the same level it was during his peak years in Washington when he was the best offensive defenseman in the league, but his 18 points (seven goals, 11 assists) are currently second on the team in scoring and have him in the top-15 among all defensemen across the league. His current scoring rate would put him on a pace for 46 points over 82 games. He has not recorded more than 45 points in a season (mostly due to injuries significantly limiting his availability in recent years) since the 2009-10 season."}

The first hat trick in the tournament’s final made Real the world champions among clubs for a second time in three years, after the royal whites also claimed two UEFA Champions League crowns in three years. But if the champions of Japan, the seasonally-appropriate Antlers and the only team in the tournament not to have won its continental club competition to gain entry, didn’t induce much fear from the outset, they nevertheless put up a fierce fight before Real Madrid made it a 37th straight game without defeat. Kashima pressed high and harried Real at a pace manager Zinedine Zidane wouldn’t have expected in a game against players few outside of Japan have heard of. After all, just two in the Antlers team have played for the Japanese national team more than once, and none in more than a dozen games. They were utterly undaunted and unimpressed by the prospect of playing perhaps the biggest club in the world and would briefly hold the lead in the second half. Kashima’s was already a remarkable story. Because in the Club World Cup, all sides are not created equal. Each confederation sends a single team and the hosts, Japan this year, get to invite its champion as well. Since the Antlers had not won their continental continental club competition last year but merely the Japanese L-League, they had to enter the tournament in the playoff stage. It took three wins just to get to the final, while the European and South American champions began the tournament in the semifinals. Kashima became the first Asian team to reach the final. The Antlers, however, had to beat Auckland City of New Zealand, the Oceania champ, in the playoffs, 2-1. Then they topped African champion Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa 2-0 in the quarterfinals, and then won 3-0 in the semis over Copa Libertadores champion Atletico National of Colombia – the same team slated to play Chapecoense in the Copa Sudamericana final last month, before that Brazilian club’s fateful air crash. That earned a trip to Sunday’s final against Real,  which had bested the Mexican North American champion Club America 2-0. Less than 10 minutes in, it seemed like Real Madrid would cruise with the early goal that would surely break Kashima’s resistance. Luka Modric ripped a volley at goalkeeper Hitoshi Sogahata, who stopped the shot only to have the ball fall right into the path of Karim Benzema. The Frenchman was alert to the opportunity and dinked the ball into the net. But the Antlers, as if to signal their intentions, immediately responded with a rocket that sailed just high by Mitsuo Ogasarawa from outside the box on a nice play. From there on, Real was fairly dominant but didn’t create a whole lot else through the puny spaces left by the Antlers. And Ronaldo was playing an unusually limp game."}

With Cristiano Ronaldo at his best and Zinedine Zidane flourishing in his first full season as a head coach, Madrid looks closer than ever to ending its title drought in the league. Madrid also had the lead after 16 matches in 2014-15, when it had also won the Champions League and the Club World Cup. That team eventually collapsed under coach Carlos Ancelotti and ended the season in disappointment. We all know what happened in 2014 after we won the Club World Cup. It can happen at any moment, said Zidane, who had been an assistant to Ancelotti. I think that the season will be long and difficult for us. If we work hard I don't think that things will change. With two more games without a loss, Madrid will match Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 games unbeaten, a mark set last season."}

But it’s more than production for the mercurial 26-year-old Balotelli, and Italy boss Giampiero Ventura needs to talk to the striker before he agrees to bring him back into the fold for the first time since the 2014 World Cup. He has 13 goals in 33 caps, the last tally coming against England in Italy’s World Cup opening win in Brazil. No one doubts that Mario is a talented player and I have nothing against him, Ventura said. But for every player, not just Balotelli, what counts is the ability to be part of a group, to make sacrifices and share an understanding. There are those who are used to doing so and others who aren’t. After the conversation I will have with him, he will have to ask questions of himself, and above all give himself answers. Balotelli has more than a few bizarre tales in his dossier. Though more than a part of us wonders whether this would happen with any other player on Balotelli’s blistering form, we imagine it would take Balotelli literally slapping Ventura for a call-up not to happen.With Andrea Belotti and Ciro Immobile among those vying for playing time, there are other suitors should Balotelli drop the ball (so to speak). This could be his last chance to impress Gli Azzurri.

Rodriguez says there are offers on the table for his services, which cost Real $84 million after the last World Cup. It’s hard to imagine his value has gone down much as, at 25, he’s still got plenty left in the tank. Chelsea is mentioned as a target. I can’t assure I will stay at Real Madrid. I have offers and seven days left to think about my future. I am happy in Madrid, but I want to play more. I have a bitter feeling as I wanted to play the final, but I am happy for the title. It’s the 15th title in my career. Marca says two of three suitors for Eibar midfielder Dani Garcia hail from the Premier League. West Ham and Southampton are said to be interested in the 26-year-old central midfielder, a box-to-box player who captains Los Armeros. And not quite a transfer, but how about this?

The managers of Liverpool and Everton had differing views on exactly how well Dean did in charge of the match at Goodison Park, which Liverpool claimed 1-0 on a late Sadio Mane goal. The controversy centers on Ross Barkley‘s awful tackle on Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, and what came after the foul. Barkley was shown yellow for going studs-up into Henderson’s ankle, and Dejan Lovren and Seamus Coleman raced to the scene for a shoving match that ended with only Coleman seeing yellow (and Lovren sitting on one).Klopp said he thought Barkley could’ve been sent off, but that overall Dean did well. I saw it. I think everything is clear. If you saw it, say how it was. The referee had a difficult game today, and Mike Dean did really well in that situation.

{"id":894,"title":" Premier League Playback: United back in the title race?","class":1,"body":"As weeks go, you don’t get many better than the one Manchester United has just had. Jose Mourinho must be full of festive cheer (well, as much as he can be) as his side won three-straight Premier League games in the space of six days to launch themselves firmly back into the top four race and they’re just four points off the top four. But are they back in the Premier League title race too? Maybe. Although Chelsea is sweeping all before them and the Blues have a 13-point over United, surely Antonio Conte‘s side have to endure a rough patch somewhere along the line, right? Logic says that’ll be the case and with other title contenders Manchester City and Arsenal clashing in Week 17 and neither looking like title material United’s chances of dragging themselves back into this race have improved drastically. Not much has changed but finally they’re being ruthless in both boxes and getting a bit of luck. Mourinho’s side have been playing well for many months now but haven’t been getting their just rewards with four home draws on the spin holding them back. They should’ve won all four with luck, poor finishing and decisions going against them. Now, though, their star names are aligning and they’re in the groove, plus decisions from the refs seems to be going in their favor. They’ve gone through the tough times and have come out of the other side swinging. United’s veteran striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has said he can play until I’m 50 after his latest two goals which gave them victory against West Brom on Saturday. Zlatan is flying. He has three goals and an assist in his past two games and has 16 goals for the season in 25 appearances for United. No player in Europe’s top five leagues has scored more goals than Zlatan since the end of November. Mourinho’s comments on Zlatan following the 2-1 win at Palace last Wednesday were telling and he may now be questioning his decision to give the 35-year-old a rest over the busy festive period. I knew the character because at his age, the personality and the passion that plays. The quality is there. I knew he would do what he’s doing, Mourinho said. Lots of passion. England is not the best place to be on holiday when a rich guy with a phenomenal career wants a holiday, he doesn’t come to England. You come to England to be in the best difficult league in the world, if you want to prove yourself, if you want to show what you can do. It’s not just about goals. It’s about goals, leadership, motivation. I’m really happy with the guy. It’s not just Zlatan, though. Behind him Paul Pogba has finally found his best position, and partnership, with Ander Herrera and Michael Carrick sitting just behind him. The Frenchman scored one and assisted another against Crystal Palace last week as United now have that Mourinho-esque knack of grinding out wins when they’re not at their best and their key contributors are stepping up and making the difference. It’s not just Zlatan, though. Behind him Paul Pogba has finally found his best position, and partnership, with Ander Herrera and Michael Carrick sitting just behind him. The Frenchman scored one and assisted another against Crystal Palace last week as United now have that Mourinho-esque knack of grinding out wins when they’re not at their best and their key contributors are stepping up and making the difference. Alongside that, Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones have forged an unexpectedly solid partnership at the center of United’s defense to as they’ve conceded just three goals in their last five games. If you look at their run of games over the busy festive period, it’s not inconceivable to believe that United could be on a six-game winning streak heading into their derby against Liverpool on Jan. 15 at Old Trafford.Sunderland (Home) – Dec. 26 Middlesbrough (Home) – Dec. 31 West Ham (Away) – Jan. 2 If United can pick up another nine points from their next three games, it would be huge. Others around them will drop points in the hectic holiday season and all of a sudden Mourinho will have the one thing managers across the Premier League, and just in general, crave: momentum. Now, it may be too big of an ask for United to win the league from this far back but a strong battle for the top four is now in the offing. 10 days again when they were nine points off fourth that didn’t look likely. Maybe, just maybe, we all ruled out United, and Mourinho, too early this season. The well-oiled machine that is Chelsea just keeps churning out wins. The latest was a 1-0 victory at a foggy Selhurst Park on Saturday against Crystal Palace and Diego Costa (who else?) grabbed the only goal with a clinical finish. Costa, 27, has been the main man for the Blues this season with his 13 goals and five assists but now Chelsea must cope without their match winner for the Boxing Day clash with Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge as the old Costa arrived as he was booked for dissent and subsequently banned one game for picking up five yellow cards. N'Golo Kante also misses the game against Bournemouth as Conte must shuffle his pack accordingly. In truth, bringing in Cesc Fabregas for Kante and Michy Batshuayi for Costa should do the trick, especially at home against an inexperienced Bournemouth side. The bigger story here is this incredible run Chelsea is on. 11 wins on the spin has equaled a club record for most consecutive wins in the top-flight and a win against Bournemouth will set a new club record. Despite all of that, Conte believe there’s plenty of room for improvement. The run is fantastic. Congratulations to my players, not me. I am pleased for them because they deserve this, Conte said. I see every single moment, every day. It is commitment, the way we prepare for the game and the way they fight. I am pleased for the fans who are fantastic home and away and who push us. We can improve though. You can always improve in different aspects. I am pleased with this level we have reached and with work we can improve. It is important to understand we are only at the 17th game in the season. There are two games before the half way. We are working very well and are in a good position. We must not look at he table and continue. We must not look at our rivals and continue work hard ourselves. Conte is not a man who rests on his laurels but his side is certainly looking close to unstoppable. The defense looks rock solid. Their midfield balance is spot on. Their attacking players are in sync and scoring vital goals when they need them. Simply put, everything is going right for Chelsea. With no European action this season they look sharp, but most of all the players look hungry to prove all the doubters wrong from last season. Conte is harnessing that hunger and unleashing it expertly in the incredibly efficient 3-4-3 system. The passionate Italian coach isn’t getting ahead of himself as his comments about still needing to improve reinforce. Don’t look at the stat below, Antonio. With a six point lead at the top, his boys don’t have a hand on the trophy just yet. Maybe just a pinky finger? One of the more heartwarming moments for fans of any team arrived this weekend. Southampton’s striker Jay Rodriguez was a man on the cusp of heading to the World Cup in April 2014. He was in the form of his life as Saints challenged for a top six finish under then manager Mauricio Pochettino.  He then ruptured his ACL when landing awkwardly and it’s been a long 32 months on the road to recovery for Rodriguez after he also suffered from a lengthy foot injury following his initial return. This season the 27-year-old has looked rusty and lacking in confidence for Saints whenever he’s played and he missed glorious chances in the last two games against Middlesbrough and Stoke City where he seemed to be thinking about the finish too much. On Sunday against Bournemouth, just his third Premier League start of the season, he scored his first brace in the Premier League since March 2014. Rodriguez is back. His second goal was an instinctive volley from 20-yards which flew into the top corner. Jay Rod is finally back and Saints’ fans were delirious at the Vitality Stadium as he handed them an early Christmas present with a comeback 3-1 win over South Coast neighbors Bournemouth to push them up to seventh in the table. Seeing the Bournemouth players and even referee Mark Clattenburg congratulating Rodriguez on his return to form was a great moment. They understand what he’s been through to get back to his best. As for Rodriguez, his return to form is timely for a Southampton side without Charlie Austin for at least three months following his need for shoulder surgery. That’s robbed Saints of their top scorer this season but in Rodriguez they have a mobile forward who can chase down lost causes and now he’s knack for scoring is back. After the derby win for Saints, ProSoccerTalk spoke to Saints’ manager Claude Puel who was delighted for his No.9 in what he hopes is the rekindling of Rodriguez’s career.I enjoy for Jay. It’s fantastic and it’s a good thing for the team. Jay can do strong work for three or four games after the injury of Charlie. He gives the good attitude, good work, good movement and good pressing every time. Today he deserve it and this is fantastic for him and for the team. All of this gives him confidence for the future, Puel said. The second goal came after the first, but the first gave him the confidence to try the second and it’s a fantastic goal. In soccer, confidence is key and fitness is vital. Rodriguez knows that better than anybody."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":895,"title":" Everton 0-1 Liverpool: Mane wins Merseyside","class":1,"body":"This one was a Merseyside Derby throwback, two rivals trading nasty tackles and shoves at Goodison Park on Monday. Sadio Mane scored the match’s only goal in the third of eight minutes of second half stoppage, beating Ashley Williams and Ramiro Funes Mori to a Daniel Sturridge reboundand lifting Liverpool into second on the Premier League table with 37 points. Everton stays 9th with 23 points. Despite electric attackers on both sides of the ball, the key players were disruptive midfielders Idrissa Gueye and Jordan Henderson. Everton was unquestionably the better side as the first half settled into form. Aaron Lennon had a cross for Romelu Lukaku cut out by Ragnar Klavan, and Ross Barkley bounced a low shot wide as the half reached its midpoint. First to almost every ball, the Toffees looked inexhaustable. Idrissa Gana Gueye was again a lively part of what Everton did, but their midfield joined the backs in buzzing around any ball Liverpool moved into an area of danger. And yet a rare moment of Liverpool attack though Georginio Wijnaldum and Nathaniel Clyne brought the match to its feet only to see Divock Origi rip his shot wide from near the penalty spot. Everton moved out James McCarthy for Gareth Barry at half, with the latter making his 750th appearance. Yet Liverpool had the better of play in the opening stages of the second half. Roberto Firmino flubbed a chance to beat an offguard Maaten Stekelenburg. Then Toffees defender Leighton Baines cleared a chance and went clattering into Stekelenburg after Firmino backheeled Sadio Mane in on the Everton keeper. Stekelenburg continued to move gingerly, and eventually had to leave the match with Joel Robles entering the fray. As things escalated, Mike Dean somehow resisted giving Ross Barkley red for a studs-up tackle on Henderson’s ankle. Seamus Coleman and Dejan Lovren saw yellow in the 69th minute after racing to join a follow-up fracas. A rare moment of attack came via Firmino, who tore into an 80th minute chance only to see Robles fly to push the ball away from danger. With 8 minutes stoppage, there would be plenty of time for an opener. Mane found it when Sturridge hit a bounding ball off the post. A diving Robles couldn’t reclaim the center of goal before Mane left-footed the ball under his flailing arms."}

(AP) A former UConn soccer player who lost her scholarship after giving the middle finger to a television camera plans to sue the school, alleging her punishment was excessive. Noriana Radwan, who now plays for Hofstra, has scheduled a news conference for Monday in New York. She made the obscene gesture to an ESPNU camera while celebrating with teammates after the Huskies beat the University of South Florida 3-2 on penalty kicks in the 2014 American Athletic Conference championship game. Coach Len Tsantiris initially suspended Radwan from the 2014 NCAA Tournament and issued a statement apologizing to the conference, USF and those who watched the game on television. In her federal lawsuit, a draft of which was given to The Associated Press, Radwan alleges that after the publicity died down, she was stripped of her scholarship midway through the school year without due process for what the coach described as serious misconduct. She was never given the opportunity to defend herself, or to appeal the decision in any way, said Greg Tarone, her attorney. They took away her dream and they took away her voice. Tarone also said that while Radwan’s offense was regrettable, it hardly rises to the level of serious misconduct, and the punishment was much harsher than what male athletes at the school have received for more serious offenses. He noted the a UConn football player, offensive lineman Brian Cespedes, was not even suspended from his team after being arrested Saturday on misdemeanor assault charges stemming from a September incident that was not public at the time. It’s clear from the information I’ve gathered that there have been many other incidents of much more serious misconduct and nobody lost a scholarship over it, Tarone said. UConn spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz said the school has not seen the lawsuit and cannot comment on it because of federal privacy laws. Radwan, a midfielder, played in nine games for the Huskies as a freshman. She did not have a goal. She transferred to Hofstra, where she is on a partial athletic scholarship. She started 17 games this past season, scoring six goals and adding an assist. She is seeking monetary damages. What she really wants is to make sure something like this does not happen to any other young woman, Tarone said."}

However, keeping in mind that the rules need to be applied in a neutral and fair manner across FIFA’s 211 member associations, the display, among others, of any political or religious symbol is strictly prohibited. England’s fine is the same as that imposed on Iran last month in a similar case. Religious ceremonies were conducted before Iran hosted South Korea in a World Cup qualifier in Tehran. Wales and Northern Ireland were fined 20,000 Swiss francs ($19,500) and 15,000 Swiss francs ($14,600), respectively, for poppy displays at home World Cup qualifiers on Nov. 12. With FIFA seeking to clarify its rules last month, it also prosecuted a retroactive case against Ireland for a political symbol on players’ shirts at a friendly match seven months earlier. The March 25 game in Dublin against Switzerland commemorated the 1916 Easter Rising of Ireland’s rebellion against British rule. FIFA fined the Irish soccer federation 5,000 Swiss francs ($4,785)."}

Oh, by the way Carlitos, any chance I can borrow a few bucks…?Over the weekend Carlos Tevez said an emotional farewell to Argentine club Boca Juniors as he will now go elsewhere to earn over 20 times what he was earning in China’s top-flight. In fact, Tevez is about to become the highest-paid player in the world. According to multiple reports the former Manchester United, Manchester City, West Ham and Juventus striker is heading to China as the latest big-name to join the riches of the Chinese Super League (CSL). Via AS, Argentine outlet Ole says that Tevez, 32, will earn over $762,000 per week on a two-year contract with CSL side Shanghai Shenhua which he will sign in the next week. That contract equates to $37.5 million a year, or $75 million over the two seasons. Mind. Blown. Below is a look at Tevez scoring his final goal for Boca, as they beat Colon 4-1 at La Bombonera on Sunday in the Argentinian Primera Division. He was subbed out in stoppage time as he got the chance to say goodbye to the fans of his boyhood club. Tevez had previously wanted to see out his career with Boca after leaving Juventus, but now it seems the huge amount of money on offer in the CSL was just too good to turn down."}

Is anybody going to stop the 35-year-old? After scoring two more goals for Manchester United in the 2-0 win against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, Zlatan took his tally in his maiden season in England to 16 goals in 25 appearances in all competitions and he has three goals and an assists in his last two Premier League games. Speaking after the game, Zlatan was at his very best. I’m settling in. I feel happy, I feel good. Even if I’m 35, in my mind I’m 20. I think I could play also at 50, but that won’t be down to me, Ibrahimovic said. The older I get, the better I get – like red wine! Do you like red wine? I’m a perfect example of that. The older I get, the better I play. Never change Zlatan. Also, never retire. Ibrahimovic is on an absolute tear right now with 11 goals in the Premier League. Since the end of November he has scored eight goals for United, which is more than any other striker in Europe’s top five leagues. That’s right, Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Diego Costa and Cristiano Ronaldo are all behind him. He has played in 25 of United’s 27 games this season and with Jose Mourinho previously saying he will rest Zlatan over the festive period, will the Swede be content with sitting on the sidelines when he’s in this kind of form? It will be a bold move for Mourinho to leave him out with United on a run of three-straight Premier League wins and having plenty of winnable games on the horizon. Zlatan has only signed a one-year deal at Old Trafford but with the kind of form he’s in, surely a contract extension will be on the table very soon. Right now, United’s next highest scorers are Paul Pogba and Juan Mata who have five goals in all competitions. Yeah, Ibra is the main man for United and they need to keep him around for another few seasons. Or, perhaps another 15."}

What they’re saying.Jurgen Klopp on his first derby at Goodison Park: As a neutral football fan, things like this are nice to see. It is not easy, even in an outstanding atmosphere. Last year we had a really good away atmosphere in Manchester for the Europa League against United. We had a wonderful atmosphere against Dortmund in both games. The job is to make it as difficult as possible for the crowd to enjoy the game. Ronald Koeman on key to winning his first-ever Merseyside derby: If you act too nice, like we have in the past this season, you need a reaction. Sometimes it is a referee’s decision and the fans are not happy, but you need that reaction from the start. It’s difficult and you have to create it for yourself. Some players always have it and some need something else to get that reaction, but we need to change that as a team. Prediction ,I think Everton will be boosted by the big win against Arsenal last week but I just think Liverpool will expose their defensive weaknesses ruthlessly. 3-1 to the Reds."}

Vardy, 29, was sent off in the first half by referee Craig Pawson after he lunged in on a Stoke’s Mame Biram Diouf with both feet off the ground. At half time Leicester’s Claudio Ranieri was irate about the decision to send the Foxes striker off and tried to speak with the referee, however the fact that 10-man Leicester fought back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 somewhat mellowed Ranieri’s post-game reaction. That said, Sky Sports is reporting that Leicester will appeal the automatic three-game ban for Vardy which would see him miss the home game on Boxing Day against Everton, plus games on Dec. 31 against West Ham and a trip to Middlesbrough on Jan. 2. For what it’s worth, Vardy was nudged by Stoke right back Glen Johnson just before he launched into the two-footed challenge, however with Pawson not sending off Manchester United’s Marcos Rojo for a very similar tackle last week the official was under the spotlight to get the decision right. Even if Vardy was pushed off balance by Johnson, that didn’t mean he had to go hurtling in to Diouf with both studs showing. Even though he got the ball he also got plenty of Stoke’s forward and the decision by Pawson seems likely to be the correct one. If Leicester do appeal the charge then they run the risk of losing Vardy for an extra game. Is that a risk worth taking with the Foxes just three points off the bottom three going into a busy slate of games."}

Nacional was scheduled to play Chapecoense in the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final on Nov. 30 but the majority of the Brazilian team lost their lives in a plane crash while flying to the match. Nacional appealed to the South American federation to declare Chapecoense the champion, a gesture which created a strong bond between the two clubs.

For Everton, a magnificent start (four wins and a draw from their first five games) to Ronald Koeman‘s first season at Goodison Park has quickly been forgotten as panic begins to set in, with the Toffees winners of just two of their last 11 league games. As momentum goes, Tuesday’s home triumph over title-chasing Arsenal will have done wonders for the blue half of Merseyside. As for the Reds, their title quest could all but come to an end on Monday. Should Jurgen Klopp‘s men fail to secure three points, they’ll enter the busy holiday period eight points behind leaders Chelsea, at best. A win would move Liverpool back into second in the league table, just six points back of the Blues. While the game is massive, it’s all been pretty straightforward with the players well aware what’s at stake, according to Klopp — quotes from the AP: Very, very, very, very big. The good thing around the derby is that I don’t have to say a lot because everybody knows what it is. For me, it’s pretty special because it’s my first time at Goodison Park. I like how Liverpool lives with this, the city, lives with these two big clubs. This is the game you want to have. How I said a few times – football is not the most important thing in the world, but on Monday night I’d say for 90 minutes in and around Liverpool, probably it is. So let’s do our best. Neither the importance nor the intensity of the Merseyside derby are lost on Liverpool striker Divock Origi, either — quotes from the Guardian: It will be a war, so we go there in a very positive way. You want to win this game, you know it will not be easy, it is a derby so it will be special and a very big and important game for us as a club also.

Bayern leads on goal difference from promoted Leipzig before the sides meet in Munich on Wednesday. It seemed the defending champions were already looking ahead to the next game as they produced an uninspired performance against Darmstadt, which had fired coach Norbert Meier on Monday after six straight losses. It wasn’t FC Bayern, goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said. The home side made a bright start under interim coach Ramon Berndroth. Bayern needed Thiago Alcantara to make a last-ditch block to deny Sandro Sirigu on a counterattack prompted by Arturo Vidal’s wayward pass seconds after kickoff. Jan Rosenthal went close for the hosts after a corner minutes later and Bayern didn’t threaten until the 40th, when Mats Hummels’ penalty appeal went unheeded. TV replays showed the Germany defender was fouled by Mario Vrancic. Thomas Mueller drew a save from Michael Esser in the Darmstadt goal early in the second half. But Bayern looked short of ideas against the hard-working Darmstadt, which was running more and restricting the visitors’ space. Another lost ball from Vidal had coach Carlo Ancelotti throw his hands up in exasperation on the sidelines. The Chilean midfielder made way for Franck Ribery with over 20 minutes remaining. A moment of individual brilliance was needed for the breakthrough and it came from Costa in the 71st, when the Brazilian let fly with a superb swerving strike from 25 meters (yards) into the goal off the underside of the crossbar. Peter Niemeyer should have equalized from the rebound when Neuer stopped Jerome Gondorf’s free kick but the Darmstadt defender headed straight back at the Bayern `keeper with the goal beckoning. In the end the most important thing is to win and stay first. So I’m satisfied, Ancelotti said. But we can play better and faster. We’ll give our best against Leipzig on Wednesday. In Sunday’s other Bundesliga match, Ingolstadt earned a much-needed victory at Bayer Leverkusen. Previously bottom Ingolstadt climbed above Hamburger SV into the relegation playoff place with its second successive win, while Leverkusen fans whistled their side off at halftime and again at full time in frustration. Alfredo Morales put the visitors in front midway through the first half with a powerful header from Markus Suttner’s fine cross. It got worse for Leverkusen early in the second half when Charles Aranguiz earned his second yellow card for a check on Anthony Jung after losing the ball. But the sending off seemed to spur a response from the home side, which equalized in the 63rd through Admir Mehmedi just after Almog Cohen should have scored at the other end. The Israeli midfielder atoned for his miss with what proved to be the winner 10 minutes later."}

Then, in his press conference, he continued that with an interesting analogy. We conceded two offside goals. The referees are protected very well, that is right, like the lions in the zoo. On replay, the first goal it appears that Leroy Sane was offside, but only by the most minute of margins. The second goal, however, appears to have been officiated correctly, with Raheem Sterling onside on Kevin De Bruyne‘s stunning cross-field pass. Wenger, however, maybe should be more concerned about his team’s complete lack of attacking presence, with almost nothing on net after opening the scoring just five minutes into the game."}

He grabbed his first from the spot after Alassane Pléa was fouled by Yunis Abdelhamid in the area. His second was a true poacher’s goal, as Arnaud Souquet fed him from the right and Balotelli expertly struck home from point-blank range. It did appear he was a fair bit offside on the second, but the flag stayed down. The double gives Balotelli eight Ligue 1 goals in eight matches, and represents his third double of the year.

Spurs had a good chance in the opening few minutes as Harry Kane flashed a cross along the face of goal but it was just out of reach of Christian Eriksen. However, it was Burnley who will feel they truly should have gone in front. Tottenham finished with 30 shots (9 on target) while Burnley could muster just five efforts, with just two on target. 11 minutes in, Stephen Ward found space down the left, and his cross fell right to a charging Andre Gray in the heart of the box, but his poke was straight at Hugo Lloris who rejected the shot, leaving Gray with his head in his hands. The game snoozed its way past the 20th minute, and just like that, Burnley went in front on a bit of sloppy play from Spurs. Harry Winks hung Kyle Walker out to dry on the Spurs right, and that let the visitors work the ball into the box. George Boyd spun and delivered the ball in front of net, and it pinged off the foot of Moussa Dembele right into the path of Ashley Barnes who slid to poke it into the back of the net.The goal for Burnley is just the club’s second on the road all season, and the first from open play, with their only other away goal coming from the penalty spot back in October against Southampton. That seemed to push Spurs into life, and they would respond almost immediately. Walker got space down the right, and he fizzed in a cross to the penalty spot, where Dele Alli stepped right in front of Harry Kane to power it in for the equalizer. Kane had one more go four minutes before halftime, but his shot was saved awkwardly by Tom Heaton. After the break, Burnley made a point to push Spurs out wide, where they seemed slightly uncomfortable. Dembele out wide in the 50th minute found Eriksen in space centrally well outside the box, and the Danish midfielder ripped a dangerous effort that stunningly just grazed over the bar with Heaton beaten. Eric Dier made a dangerous challenge with Grey free, but just got a clip of the ball to keep him from being cautioned or worse. Just down the other end, Eriksen again should have scored right in front of net, but bungled the chance. Danny Rose pressure on Matthew Lowton deep in the corner saw Rose come out with the ball, and he dinked it over to Eriksen in the box, but his header was directly at Heaton. Alli nearly had a stunner past the hour mark, but he just missed the top corner by inches with a turn and clipped shot. Spurs continued to pummel the Burnley goal, and a loopy, dipping ball from Eriksen forced a great save by Heaton on 64 minutes. Burnley wouldn’t be able to hold on forever, though, and it was Rose to put Spurs in front. A good ball from substitute Moussa Sissokho, he fed Rose on the left, and instead of touching inside, he hit it quick and beat Heaton to the near post to put Spurs in front. The visitors had a spell of pressure toward the end looking to make their way back in the game, but there was no way through. The three points for Spurs sees them pull within one of Arsenal, who lost to Manchester City on the road. Burnley remains in trouble, three points above the relegation zone in 16th."}

Kevin De Bruyne delivered one of the assists of the season and Raheem Sterling finished it off in style as Manchester City moved to third in the Premier League table. Theo Walcott had put Arsenal in front early, but they had little else to offer and allowed City to slowly build their way back in. Leroy Sane was the one to equalize just minutes after halftime before Sterling’s winner. Arsenal was content to sit back and see City come at them, and when they got on the ball, they were immediately incisive. Unpressured, Alexis Sanchez was able to dribble forward and feed through Theo Walcott, who had snuck behind Nicolas Otamendi, and the English international struck home clinically for the opener just five minutes gone by. Right down the other end, it should have been 1-1, but the home side missed a huge chance. De Bruyne ripped a perfect cross into the box, and Sterling was there to meet it, but he blasted his header just wide right with the goal gaping. The game slowed down following that chance, with few chances past the half-hour mark, but Arsenal held much of the meaningful possession. Walcott headed just wide from a Gabriel cross on 35 minutes, and David Silva earned the game’s first yellow card minutes later as he brought down Francis Coquelin on a break. Pablo Zabaleta appeared to be slowing by halftime, and out of the break Guardiola replaced him with Bacary Sagna. Hardly even out of the break, Manchester City was level. A chipped ball from David Silva caught the Arsenal back line napping, and it slipped Sane through to charge into the box and tap home just two minutes after the restart. Replay showed Sane was just a hair offside, but the margin was very slight. Petr Cech saved the game for the Gunners on the hour mark, as Sane nearly put City in front. Fernando won the ball in midfield, allowing de Bruyne to feed Sane again as he stayed clearly onside this time, but Petr Cech came off his line to smother the chance and Sane subsequently shot right into the chest of the Arsenal goalkeeper. Then, the moment of the match and maybe a moment of the season. One of the most incredible passes you’ll ever see, Kevin de Bruyne got the ball on a throw-in and somehow contorted his body to clip the ball 40 yards across the pitch while facing his own goal. The ball fell right into the lap of Sterling, and still with work to do, he cut inside and beat Cech to his near post to put Manchester City in front. A stunning goal from start to finish, fitting to win this match. The win for Manchester City sees them jump the Gunners into third place on 36 points, relief for Pep Guardiola now on two straight wins after the rare pair of losses. For Arsenal, they fall to fourth and now sit just a point above rival Spurs after Tottenham downed Burnley."}

Not impossible — this is Star Wars, not a psychological thriller — but a bit bumpier than the usual spoon-fed exposition of a Star Wars flick. It gains momentum in the middle. The ending, however, is absolutely fabulous, giving us some things we’ve never seen before. Stuff we’ve always imagined playing out in the Star Wars universe but which has never been shown. That’s all I’ll say about that. Suffice it to say, the movie pays off wonderfully at the end. As far as the normal movie review stuff: the characters, as Doolittle and other reviewers have noted, were less-than-wonderfully fleshed out, with the audience being given more in the way of archetypes than actual people. Maybe it’s enough in a Star Wars movie to have a Hero, a Secondary, somewhat more reluctant and jaded hero, a couple of stock warrior types and some comic relief. I dunno. There’s an argument to be made that the original trilogy characters were kind of lightly written too and only assumed a lot of heft by virtue of 40 years of Gen-X nostaliga doing the work that George Lucas never bothered to do. Indeed, I’d be eager to have that conversation. I can see both sides of it. Ultimately, though, it doesn’t much matter. This is not Grand Cinema. It’s Star Wars. And as as Star Wars movie it works really well, even if it does things totally differently than any of the other seven movies in the series have done."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":920,"title":"Pirates sign Daniel Hudson to a two-year, $11 million contract","class":1,"body":"The Pirates have signed pitcher Daniel Hudson to a two-year, $11 million deal, per Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports. Hudson, 29, has been a reliever for the last two seasons. As such, he’ll add depth to the Pirates’ bullpen. As Passan notes, Hudson has a potential path to the closer’s role as the club is expected to eventually trade Tony Watson. Hudson posted a 5.22 ERA with a 58/22 K/BB ratio in 60 1/3 innings last season after putting up a 3.86 ERA in 2015, both with the Diamondbacks. Since moving to relief work, Hudson’s fastball has sat in the mid-90’s.

{"id":921,"title":"Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens are seeing a big uptick in Hall of Fame support. Why?","class":1,"body":"Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens have yet to break 50% in the Hall of Fame vote in their four years on the ballot. In this, their fifth year, however, they are likely to see their vote totals go up substantially. That’s if the public ballots compiled by Ryan Thibodaux are any indication. To be sure, Thibodaux does not project or predict who will or won’t be inducted. He merely keeps a tally of support on ballots which are released by the voters. Historically, the public ballots show support for candidates at higher rates than that which is ultimately reflected in the final vote tally. Still, one can compare the preliminary support Bonds and Clemens have received over the years and current support and surmise that each will gain substantially this year. Jeff Passan, based on Thibodaux’s data, believes both will rocket over 50% this year and, maybe not this near and maybe not next, but soon, will be inducted to the Hall of Fame by the BBWAA. I think he’s right about that. I’m not sure I agree 100% on the reason given, however. The given reason: the Bud Selig effect. The Bud Selig effect is the idea that since Selig was elected to the Hall of Fame by the Today’s Game Committee, what basis is there for keeping Bonds and Clemens out? The latter may have used PEDs to elevate their games, but the former turned a blind eye to and, along with the rest of baseball’s establishment, reaped the rewards of PEDs. If the man who did nothing about steroids in baseball until forced to by bad p.r. is in the Hall of Fame, why should the players be barred? The Bud Selig effect holds that Hall of Fame voters have been asking themselves that question for the past two weeks and, finding no suitable answer for it, have been changing their votes against Bonds and Clemens into votes in their favor. It’s an appealing line of reasoning. It has been evidenced by a lot of voters saying as much on Twitter or in columns in the past two weeks. And, as I have argued ad nauseam, Bonds and Clemens belong in the Hall of Fame in their own right. But it also seems a bit too pat for me. Was it hard to predict, a year ago, that Selig would eventually be elected to the Hall of Fame? Two years ago? More to the point, was it ever, in the past decade, hard to see how a double standard with respect to Selig on the one hand and players on the other existed when it came to PEDs and their stain on the game? Of course not. It was always clear that Selig held his own share of responsibilities for PEDs in the game and that the game was always, always going to revere him all the same. I’m not sure why the vote of the Today’s Game Committee, which was inevitable from the moment Selig announced his retirement, changed any of that. While it’s possible that some Hall of Fame voters were truly shocked by Selig’s election and that, as a result, they have been spontaneously compelled to change their votes on Clemens and Bonds, I suspect that something else is going on. I suspect that, while four or five years ago there was a genuinely-felt need on the part of many voters to keep PED users out of the Hall of Fame, the passage of time has made that stance seem pretty empty. I imagine there are a number of voters who have watched Bonds, Clemens, Mark McGwire and others welcomed by their former big league clubs in their retirement. Who have seen them take jobs in Major League Baseball. Who have watched them still be embraced by fans. All of that has happened, no one has died and baseball has chugged on just fine despite their having taken drugs while they played. As a result of all of this, I think a lot of voters have lost their once powerful anti-PED fervor of a few years back. I think they have come to accept that it seems silly now to treat these men as pariahs when, in reality, they were merely men of their era, just as amphetamine users, spitballers and those who played in a segregated environment were men of their eras. Maybe you give them a bit of a discount for their actions, but even at clearance sale prices, Bonds and Clemens are Hall of Famers. Yet I also believe that, despite their gradual realization that neither Bonds nor Clemens was the Antichrist, they needed an excuse to change their vote. And with Selig’s election, they got one. It’s hard to convince someone to change their mind about anything, but when it’s a position imbued with moral convictions — when it’s a position for which one has argued passionately over the years and for which one has taken a good deal of crticism — it’s harder still. It’s a lot easier to change one’s mind due to the facts on the ground changing than it is to admit one was wrong in the first place. I believe that a good many voters came to realize that the anti-PED stance when it comes to the Hall of Fame was less compelling than they first thought a good while ago, but were loathe to change their mind without the cover of some changing facts on the ground to which they could point. They now point to Selig’s election and have the cover to do so. In effect, this is of no real consequence. If the patterns hold and if Bonds and Clemens are inducted in the coming years, the right result will have been reached and, ultimately, that’s all that matters. But I am still loathe to nod along with the idea that putting them in the Hall of Fame was made possible only by some shocking act of hypocrisy on the part of the Hall of Fame or the Today’s Game committee. I am loathe to accept a framing that goes well, since they are willing to drop the standards for Cooperstown we voters have no choice but to do so too. I think that lets voters off the hook for their mishandling of PED associated and PED suspected candidates of the past several years. More importantly, I think it would be better for our understanding of baseball and baseball history to treat Bonds and Clemens being inducted one day to be an act of historical appreciation, just like any other player’s induction is, as opposed to one of procedural spite."}

Carr was treated on the field and the sideline, and it’s believed he was then transported to a local hospital. The injury occurred when Carr was sacked and landed awkwardly, and Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said after the game that Carr suffered a broken fibula. It was 33-14 at the time. The Raiders held on to win, 33-25. Once down 33-7, the Colts staged an impressive comeback and looked like they may get one more shot at it before an acrobatic catch by Amari Cooper converted a third down for the Raiders near the two-minute mark. The Raiders ran for 210 yards. Carr threw three touchdown passes in the second quarter. Now, Matt McGloin takes over as the Raiders’ quarterback. The Colts’ playoff hopes ended with the loss.

It’s the first time the Chiefs have scored in the second half since Week 13 against the Falcons. Alex Smith was involved in the two biggest plays on the drive. He ran for 13 yards for one first down and hit tight end Travis Kelce for 15 yards to pick up another. Kelce is up to a career-high and franchise-record 161 yards on the day and a Broncos defense missing Brandon Marshall and T.J. Ward hasn’t been able to keep up with him at all.

{"id":924,"title":"Chiefs take 21-10 lead into locker room at halftime","class":1,"body":"Broncos coach Gary Kubiak had to break up an argument in the team’s locker room after last week’s loss to the Patriots because cornerback Aqib Talib took issue with left tackle Russell Okung addressing the team following a poor offensive performance. The Broncos offense hasn’t been great on Sunday night, but members of that unit still might have a few choice words for the defense should Kubiak decide to open the floor to comments again at halftime. The Chiefs rolled up 330 yards in the first half of Sunday night’s game, the first time a Denver defense has given up more than 300 yards in a half since 1981, and lead the game 21-10 at the half. Kansas City picked up 150 of those yards on two plays, both of which resulted in touchdowns. Rookie wide receiver Tyreek Hill scored on a 70-yard run (and has 102 yards on four carries) and tight end Travis Kelce turned a short pass into an 80-yard score as the Chiefs raced out to a 21-7 lead before the first quarter was over. The Broncos were more effective in the second 15 minutes as the Chiefs punted twice and missed a field goal, but the offense was only able to generate a pair of field goal attempts when they had the ball. Brandon McManus made one, but failed to convert a fake that had McManus try running for a first down just before halftime. At 52 yards, it would have been a long field goal try but the thought speaks to how little the Broncos believe in their offense at this point. Given the way their defense played to open the game, they’ll need that to change if their playoff hopes extend beyond this evening."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":925,"title":" Pets provide valuable support to those with mental health problems, study suggests ","class":1,"body":" Pets play a valuable role in their owners’ recovery from mental health issues, but are never considered nor incorporated in individual mental health care plans, researchers report. The British study team reached the conclusion following interviews in England with 54 people, each of whom had been diagnosed with a long-term mental health problem. Twenty-five of them identified a pet in their social network. The researchers from the University of Manchester and University of Southampton, writing in BMC Psychiatry, noted that, in the context of mental health recovery, there was limited understanding of the potential value and contribution of pet ownership to personal support networks for self-management. Helen Brooks, Kelly Rushton, Sandra Walker, Karina Lovell and Anne Rogers set out to explore the role of pets in the personal networks of people with long-term mental health issues. In the interviews, the people were encouraged to talk about the relationship, value, utility and meaning of pets in the context of the provision of social support and management provided by other network members. Interviews were recorded, then transcribed before being analysed. The majority of pets were placed in the central, most valued circle of support, the researchers found. Pets were implicated in relational work through the provision of secure and intimate relationships not available elsewhere, they wrote. Pets helped in managing feelings through distracting their owners from both symptoms and upsetting experiences, and provided a form of encouragement for activity. Despite these benefits, pets were unanimously neither considered nor incorporated into individual mental health care plans. They continued: Pet owners talked about the pride associated with having a pet that was seen to be well loved and cared for. Given the high levels of unemployment and isolation within the sample, participants had limited other opportunities to develop this form of validation. One participant’s love of animals had led her to the local city farm where she volunteered, which impacted on her confidence. Often, the physical connection with pets was enhanced through mastery such as teaching an animal tricks. Through these relationships with their pets, participants could present themselves to others in a more positive light. Pets often introduced a source of humour into difficult situations and were often the only thing that could lift participants’ spirits. Pets were identified as having a role in providing routine for their owners, they observed. For some, pets encouraged exercise and for others their pets were the only reason they got out of bed in the morning. Through the rituals of feeding, exercise, grooming and caring for their pet a sense of consistent daily routine became embedded in their lives, which participants felt was vital for their wellbeing. Pets contributed, over time, to individuals developing routines that provided emotional and social support. Discussing their findings, they observed: On the face of things, it appears that the participants raised similar themes as those with physical health conditions. However, in relation to the salience of themes with specific regard to mental health, there were clear differences. Participants in this study had more difficult and contentious relationships with others and experienced greater levels of stigma than those included in studies of chronic physical conditions. This increased the perceived importance of their pets, reflecting the added salience of being labelled with a mental health problem as having a greater impact on one’s sense of ‘self’ than physical illnesses, since the surveillance of moral responsibility may be felt more intensely, and levels of isolation and stigma are likely to be greater. Pets, the researchers suggested, should be considered a main rather than a marginal source of support in the management of long-term mental health problems. This has implications for the planning and delivery of mental health services. The pets at the centre of the study were small animals, such as dogs, cats, birds, hamsters and guinea pigs."}

Mkhitaryan, who grabbed his first Premier League goal in the 1-0 win over Tottenham three days after that success in the Europa League, met a cross from Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the closing minutes and connected with a 'scorpion' kick to seal victory over the Black Cats.Following the win at Old Trafford, United manager Jose Mourinho called the goal phenomenal and Mkhitaryan freely admits it was the greatest of his career to date. That was the best goal I've ever scored, he told MUTV. I was very excited.The first thing I did was look at the assistant and I saw it was not ruled as offside so I just started to celebrate.I was expecting the ball to be in front of me and then I realised I was in front of it. As the ball was behind me, the only thing I could do was a backheel so I did that and I succeeded. Daley Blind's low strike put United in front before half-time, with Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan scoring late on before a superb consolation goal from Fabio Borini. It was United's fourth straight Premier League win and Mkhitaryan wants to extend that run in the New Year's Eve clash with Middlesbrough, which the attacking midfielder may well start after overcoming an ankle complaint. I don't have anything of concern from a past injury so I'm happy to be back to help the team, he said. I will try to do my best for the next game.

Tess Scott-Adams, Centre Manager at Blue Cross in Rolleston said: We were so worried about this group of horses when they arrived. We feared Little Miss Agatha and her foal, who were in an even worse state than the other pair, would not make it. But thanks to the special care and medication they received they are now well enough to find a home. The four have been nursed back to health at Blue Cross rehoming centre in Rolleston-on-Dove, Staffordshire. Rio was very weak and when the team realised he wasn’t feeding from his mum, they encouraged him to drink replacement milk. Both mum and foal were put on a feeding plan to help them gain weight and improve their overall condition. Now, both foals are doing well and are being weaned off their mums and will be looking for new homes in the New Year. Their mums are also now healthy and being assessed as potential riding ponies and will also look for loving new homes soon The foals are looking for a short-term home until they are four years old when Blue Cross will need to re-assess their future as potential riding ponies. They will need a companion of a similar age in their new home and need to be cared for by someone who has experience of caring for and handling young ponies.

Antonio Conte's side earlier set a club record of 12 straight Premier League wins with a 3-0 win over Bournemouth. We have played seven more than [Chelsea], which is why it will be tough, said Guardiola. Liverpool went so close [to the title] one year because they had one game a week and last year, for Leicester, it happened the same. This time Chelsea and Liverpool are the ones. Both Liverpool and Chelsea failed to qualify for European competition this campaign after finishing eighth and 10th respectively in the Premier League last year. Manchester City face Monaco in the last 16 of this year's Champions League, with the first leg on 21 February. In their last season without European football, Liverpool narrowly missed out on the 2013/14 Premier League title to Manchester City, while Leicester won last year's title only playing domestically. Liverpool will move ahead of Manchester City in the table if they beat Stoke at Anfield on Tuesday. Sometimes you play before Chelsea, sometimes later - but it doesn't matter when one team has won 12 in a row, added Guardiola. It's like a final for us if you want to be there until the end of the season.But football is unpredictable. We have to do absolutely everything to be there.

This year, Brees is likely to do it for the fifth time. Brees has an NFL-high 4,858 passing yards this season, meaning he’ll almost certainly top 5,000 yards for the season in Week 17. Brees leads the league in passing by more than 200 yards over Washington’s Kirk Cousins, who has 4,630 passing yards this season, meaning Brees is a virtual lock to finish as the league leader for the seventh time in his career. The rate at which Brees puts up yardage is unprecedented in NFL history: Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Dan Marino and Matthew Stafford have each reached 5,000 yards once, and no one else has ever done it at all. If the 37-year-old Brees stays healthy for two more years, he’s likely to pass both Brett Favre and Manning and move into first place all-time in total passing yards.

Cesc Fabregas set up Pedro to break the deadlock with a deflected shot that looped into the top corner. Eden Hazard capped an impressive display by making it 2-0 from the spot after he was brought down by Simon Francis. Chelsea added a third goal deep in injury time when Pedro's shot hit Steve Cook and the ball span over the line. Bournemouth's best chance saw substitute Benik Afobe denied by Thibaut Courtois but the Cherries ended up well beaten. Liverpool can reduce Chelsea's lead to six points if they beat Stoke on Tuesday. Chelsea were missing two key components of their recent run, with striker Diego Costa and midfielder N'Golo Kante both suspended, but it made little difference. Without Costa to lead the line, and the Blues £33m Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi again left on the bench, Antonio Conte went with a front three of Hazard, Willian and Pedro. It took time for them to hit their stride but the three players eventually proved an effective combination. They were happy to swap positions throughout the game but all three caused the Cherries problems when they ran at them, especially on the break.This is the first time we played without a real forward, Chelsea manager Conte explained. We tried this in training and I think for us at the moment this situation is the best, but I don't forget Michy because he is a young player with great talent. He is adapting to this league and its football. In the future, I trust in him. Kante's absence, meanwhile, saw Fabregas recalled to partner Nemanja Matic at the heart of Antonio Conte's midfield. Again they took time to settle down, giving Jack Wilshere too much room on a couple of occasions before the break, but they were far more assured after half-time. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe switched to a 3-4-3 formation to match Chelsea's shape and, initially, it worked. Even when Pedro put the hosts ahead, the Cherries looked capable of causing them problems and Wilshere got on the ball in some good positions, going close twice. It did not last, and Bournemouth were kept at arm's length for much of the second half - enjoying more possession than Chelsea but unable to do much with the ball, and in constant danger from counter-attacks. You can't be too upbeat about getting beaten 3-0 but there were fine margins and many elements of our game-plan worked, Howe said afterwards. They scored their first goal out of the blue, without any real sustained period of pressure, and the second goal just after half-time was the decisive moment. Howe's side remain seven points above the relegation zone so have breathing space, but their away form is becoming a cause for concern."}

Taylor had his first 300-yard passing day in the NFL, finishing with 329 yards, and added 60 rushing yards as the Bills set a franchise record with 589 total yards of offense. All of that production came after Taylor got in a car accident on his way to the stadium and took a big hit on the second possession of the game that led to EJ Manuel briefly warming up on the sideline. Statistically, yes, it was a good day, Taylor said, via the Buffalo News. But like I said from Day One, you’re judged by wins as a quarterback. Taylor and wide receiver Sammy Watkins connected seven times for 154 yards and a touchdown in the kind of game that the Bills were hoping to see all season. Watkins’ foot injury interrupted that connection and other injuries depleted the receiving corps, but Taylor said Saturday showed how explosive we can be when everyone is healthy. Will Taylor be around to see that play out? As has been well covered this season, the Bills have to make a decision about picking up an option on Taylor’s contract that will pay him over $30 million in guaranteed money. It wouldn’t be much of a decision if there had been more games like the one against the Dolphins, but going out on a high note has worked for others in the past."}

The large cast that he wore on his left leg is gone, which Tannehill said, via the Miami Herald, is great news.

Johnson looked like he was going to miss out on tying Sanders through three quarters as he had 57 yards from scrimmage, but he had 79 yards, including another 29-yard catch on the winning drive, in the final 15 minutes. The season hasn’t played out as anyone in Arizona would have hoped, but Johnson will keep running back from being a spot they need to address in the offseason."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":938,"title":" Manchester City climbed to second place in the Premier League ","class":1,"body":" Pep Guardiola's visitors were far from their free-flowing best en route to their 12th win of the season, but were nevertheless good value for a victory that keeps them seven points behind leaders Chelsea. Yaya Toure's penalty, awarded after Andrew Robertson's clumsy challenge on Raheem Sterling, set the visitors on their way before Kelechi Iheanacho added a second from close range and Curtis Davies conceded an own goal in the last few seconds. Hull have now conceded nine penalties so far in the league this season - four more than any other side. The hosts played well in patches and saw Michael Dawson's second-half header cleared off the line by Bacary Sagna, but their return of one win in 16 matches is a damning statistic that points to only one outcome at the end of the season. And it will not be lost on Tigers fans that the side bottom on Christmas Day have only stayed up three times in the 24 Premier League seasons to date. Guardiola's players will not earn many style points for this latest win but the final result is all that matters as they bid to keep in touch with Antonio Conte's flying leaders. After starting December with back-to-back losses to Chelsea and champions Leicester, Man City now appear to be comfortably back in the winning groove with nine points from nine. Sergio Aguero was sitting out the final game of his four-match ban and his absence appeared to be felt in a first half of few chances. Guardiola decided against employing out-and-out striker Iheanacho from the start in favour of a four-man forward line of Kevin de Bruyne, Sterling, David Silva and Nolito, and they did not click into gear until after the break. And Sterling took centre stage with a probing run into the area which proved the turning point, drawing a needless foul from Robertson that presented Toure with a chance from 12 yards that he did not pass up. Iheanacho, introduced from the bench in the 57th minute, added a simple second after good work by Silva, before more direct running from Sterling forced Davies to turn into his own net in the fourth minute of added time. The only real scare for Guardiola during the match was the early withdrawal of England defender John Stones through injury, but his concerns were quickly allayed. We were a little bit worried about that but it is just a kick, not ligaments or something like that, said Guardiola. Hull pay the penalty .Hull have conceded the first goal of the game a league-high 15 times this season, but the rate at which the Tigers are shipping penalties is an even more alarming statistic. With nine conceded so far, Mike Phelan's men are giving away spot-kicks at the rate of one every two matches. But they have committed just 186 fouls in 18 games so far - just four teams have conceded fewer - meaning they have given away one penalty for every 20.6 fouls committed. A mixture of poor judgement and ill fortune lurk behind most of those spot-kicks - two things the Tigers could do without if they are to escape from trouble. Should they continue to give up penalties at even half the present rate, they will comfortably eclipse the Premier League record of 11 penalties conceded in a season, held by the Blackburn team of 2006-07.."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":939,"title":" Dirk Koetter on benching Doug Martin: I felt Jacquizz Rodgers was better for this game","class":1,"body":"The Buccaneers played without running back Doug Martin for more than a month earlier this season because of an injury, but it was a coach’s decision that kept Martin out of the lineup against the Saints on Saturday. Martin was a healthy scratch as the Bucs opted to go with Jacquizz Rodgers, Charles Sims and Peyton Barber in the backfield. The decision came a week after Rodgers was a healthy scratch and coach Dirk Koetter explained after the game that there’s only room for one in the lineup at a time. It was Rodgers’ turn this week and Koetter shut down attempts to draw conclusions about what the decision meant for Martin’s future with the team.I’m not going to get into any of that, Koetter said, via the Associated Press. We’re blessed with good depth at running back, and this was a decision for today. It is what it is for today, and obviously we have to deal with what comes next. Martin said he wanted to play, but that it was the coach’s decision for him to sit out. Rodgers had 15 carries for 63 yards and a touchdown in the 31-24 loss and has now run for 485 yards on 112 carries this season. Martin has 421 yards on 144 carries, so the performance edge definitely goes to Rodgers. That’s probably not how Tampa envisioned things playing out when they re-signed Martin in the offseason and we’ll see if Koetter’s Saturday decision leads to any others come this offseason."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":940,"title":" Rex Ryan insists he called timeout before game-tying field goal","class":1,"body":"After Dolphins kicker Andrew Franks hit a 55-yard field goal to send Saturday’s game against the Bills into overtime, Bills coach Rex Ryan could be seen pleading with an official on the sideline while indicating that he called timeout ahead of the snap. Referee Craig Wrolstad said in a pool report after the game that the head linesman was standing next to Ryan and said that Ryan never called timeout before the snap. So he called timeout evidently after the ball was snapped or that is when our guy heard him or acknowledged him after the snap, Wrolstad said. Ryan disputed calling timeout after the ball was snapped and said That’s interesting, Ryan said, via ESPN.com. Obviously he never called it, he never blew it dead. I was yelling at him. I went over to him. I’m sure you saw our players trying to call the timeout, trying to put our field goal block team on the field. And so then they’re not saying [timeout], and I looked and I was shocked it hadn’t been called. Then I’m like, ‘Timeout, timeout.’ Then I’m even trying to signal it to the guy. But I’m assuming the thing’s gonna be done. But I’m over there, yelling timeout well before the thing was kicked. It will show up. I’m sure there was audio of it. So we’ll get it. Ryan had plenty of other things to explain after Franks kicked another field goal to win the game in overtime, including his decision to punt with four minutes left in overtime when a loss or tie eliminated the Bills from playoff contention and having just 10 players on the field when Jay Ajayi ran 57 yards to set up the game-winning kick. Neither of those things might have happened had Ryan got the timeout he says he called, but that hardly makes the way things played out any easier to swallow."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":941,"title":" Aresnal 1- 0 West Bromwich Albion","class":1,"body":" Giroud was making his first league start of the season and looped in an 86th minute header from a Mesut Ozil cross for his goal. Until that moment the Gunners had enjoyed nearly 80% possession, but had struggled to find a way past inspired Baggies keeper Ben Foster. He pulled off a number of key stops, including a double save when he parried an Alex Iwobi shot and blocked the rebound at the feet of Alexis Sanchez. The 33-year-old former England keeper also tipped over a fizzing shot from Sanchez before West Brom nearly snatched a goal, with Claudio Yacob skying his shot over the bar after Arsenal keeper Petr Cech dropped a corner. But Giroud finally broke the deadlock to keep Arsenal nine points behind leaders Chelsea, who beat Bournemouth. Relive Arsenal v West Brom. Follow reaction to Saturday's games .Arsenal patience pays off .Arsenal had buckled in defeats by Everton and Manchester City in their previous two games and the focus was on how they would respond against one of the more resolute teams to beat in the top flight. It seemed like they were still feeling the impact of those losses as they had just one shot on target in the first half, but they managed 10 after the break as they increased their intensity and urgency. Sanchez was their main threat as the Chile forward tried to drag the Gunners single-handedly to three points but, like his team, he found himself being continually frustrated. Sanchez seemed set to score when he evaded a number of defenders in a run across the six-yard box only to strike his shot against the post, before Arsenal's persistence was eventually rewarded through Giroud. It has been a big relief, said the France striker. We pushed to the end, kept believing in our game.We were very strong altogether and showed a good strong mentality. It was very important to win. We have shown a big mental strength.."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":942,"title":" Panthers will be without Reilly Smith for 7-10 days","class":1,"body":"The Florida Panthers allowed an early two-goal lead to slip away on Friday night in what turned out to be a 4-3 shootout loss to the Detroit Red Wings. Along with losing the lead and the game, the Panthers also lost forward Reilly Smith to a concussion when he was on the receiving end of a massive hit from Red Wings defenseman Niklas Kronwall in the second period. You can see the hit again in the video above. Smith left the game and did not return, while coach Tom Rowe said after the game that Smith suffered a concussion and is expected to miss at least the next 7-10 days. That timeframe, assuming it does not change — and with concussions you never really know how it could change — means he is likely to miss at least the Panthers’ next three games coming out of the holiday break. They Toronto and Montreal on back-to-back nights on Wednesday and Thursday before going on the road to Dallas on Saturday. After a 25-goal, 50-point season a year ago for the Panthers the 2016-17 season has been a tougher one for Smith with just seven goals and eight assists in his first 35 games. Perhaps even more concerning for the Panthers is that 15 point total is still good enough for fifth on the team. The injury comes just as Smith was starting to see his point production pick up a bit. After record just seven points in his first 23 games he had eight in his past 12. That includes five points (three goals) in the past six games. Injuries have played a role in the Panthers’ struggles this season. They still have not had Jonathan Huberdeau this season, while Nick Bjugstad and Jussi Jokinen have also missed some time."}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								
{"id":943,"title":" Lewis Hamilton pips Max Verstappen to top 2016 F1 driver list ","class":1,"body":" After the curtain came down on the season, we asked you to vote for your top three drivers of the year and it was the three-time world champion who came out on top. Of those who selected their top three drivers of the season via the BBC F1 list, 38% put Hamilton in top spot. The Briton won the most races with 10 but his title challenge was hampered by mechanical issues. Hamilton was in particularly impressive form in the closing stages of the season, taking pole and converting it to victory in each of the final four races but in the end Rosberg did just enough as the German beat his team-mate to the title by five points. Best moment: Hamilton finished the season strongly but it was a brilliant victory in Monaco that kick-started his campaign as he produced a masterclass in defensive driving to keep Daniel Ricciardo at bay for 45 laps. How Max Verstappen will hope a title battle with Hamilton will be as close as this in the near future. The fearless Dutch teenager was chosen as the number one driver of the season by 37% of you - just 1% behind Hamilton. The 19-year-old is clearly an exceptional talent but he produced some breathtaking displays this season that will have perhaps taken even those who know him best by surprise. Best moment: Arguably Verstappen's most eye-catching display was his drive in the wet in Brazil where he battled back from 16th to finish on the podium with one move in particular standing out - a gutsy, around-the-outside pass over Sergio Perez at Turn 10 that he completed in Turn 11 having corrected a big slide on his way through. And this in a season when he won his maiden grand prix in Spain. His victories at Silverstone and Interlagos were peerless, says Tom. But he's always been capable of mind-bending performances; what stood out about Lewis Hamilton in 2016 was the maturity he showed in adversity. He's now the ultimate all-round driver. Some are keen to compare Max to the likes of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost in his talent - which clearly shone in Brazil, says Jennie, but I make him my driver of the season not just for talent, but for the thousands of new fans he is bringing to F1. While Lewis Hamilton is lauded for opening F1 to new audiences and doing his thing in Hollywood, for me it's actually Max who is bringing fans through the gates and turning on a whole new generation to the sport we know and love. Chief F1 writer Andrew Benson: 1) Daniel Ricciardo, 2) Fernando Alonso, 3) Lewis Hamilton Ricciardo was brilliantly fast and consistent all season, while Alonso showed his enduring qualities with some outstanding drives and stunning first laps. For me, both, on balance, shaded Hamilton, who was phenomenal as ever for the most part but had a couple of very shaky weekends and made too many poor starts. Sebastian Vettel finished on the podium in seven of the races in 2016, so is it a bit of a surprise to see him topping this? Certainly by his high standards, Vettel did disappoint this season. After winning three races in his first season at Ferrari, he failed to claim a single victory in 2016. Ferrari were expected to be one of Mercedes' main rivals but that challenge failed to materialise as Vettel instead found himself mostly scrapping around in fourth of fifth, his frustration evident in his many expletive-laden radio messages in the latter half of the season. Worst moment: telling Formula 1's race director, Charlie Whiting, to go away, in a note-quite-so-polite manner. It was the year to forget for Daniil Kvyat as he started the season at Red Bull and finished it at their junior team, Toro Rosso. Kvyat later said that situation led to him no longer enjoying F1 and his future in the sport was left uncertain, but his contract at Toro Rosso was renewed for 2017 and he will be hopeful of coming back strongly in the new year. Worst moment: The Russian was demoted after his home race, where he twice hit Sebastian Vettel within the first three corners of the first lap. Although he did drive to an excellent podium in China before that, managing to rile Vettel in the process. The Mexican came under fire from his fellow drivers' rival team bosses for his track manners over the course of the season. He was criticised by Daniel Ricciardo for not obeying blue flags in Germany and by Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff for cruising around in Singapore while Ricciardo and Nico Rosberg were fighting for victory. In the end he was dropped by Haas having failed to score a single point all year. Worst moment: Being hauled back into the garage by Haas team principal Gunther Steiner after attempting to flounce away. Tom Clarkson: 1) Felipe Nasr, 2) Esteban Gutierrez, 3) Rio Haryanto Until we got to Interlagos, 2016 had been an underwhelming year for Felipe Nasr. More often than not out-qualified by team-mate Marcus Ericsson, he delivered no performances of real merit until we got to Brazil. But that drive to 9th place, in those conditions, and in that car, was spectacular. More please. Jennie Gow: 1) Felipe Massa, 2) Sebastian Vettel, 3) Valtteri Bottas Felipe Massa - in what was supposed to be his final year in F1 it would have been nice for the Brazilian to go out on a high - unfortunately its not been either his, or Williams' year and his best result of a couple of fifth's at the start of the season seem a long time ago. At least he now seems likely to get another chance."}

Team general manager Jim Johannson said the talent level in the United States is currently among the best in the world, and their difficulty in assembling this roster spoke to that. The team will be coached by St. Cloud State head coach Bob Motzko, and the roster has a heavy NCAA influence with 19 of the 23 players on the final roster currently playing collegiate hockey in the United States. Only three players are currently playing major junior hockey, while (forward Jack Roslovic) is playing in the American Hockey League. Boston University alone has six players on the roster. Arizona Coyotes first-round draft pick Clayton Keller (pictured above) is one of the players that headlines the roster. The heavy NCAA influence on the roster is especially interesting when you look at who is not on the roster, especially when it comes to Alex Debrincat and Logan Brown. DeBrincat, a second-round draft pick of the Chicago Blackhawks in 2016, is one of the most dominant offensive players in junior hockey and is currently working on what should be his third consecutive 50-goal, 100-point season for the Erie Otters in the OHL. He had a tough showing at last year’s tournament, but he is still a potential game-breaker that the United States left at home, something that has become a habit at all levels of USA hockey in recent years. The Brown decision is probably a little more understandable because he has been battling a wrist injury this season that has limited him to only 15 games for the Windsor Spitfires, but he and Debrincat are probably two of the best offensive players Team USA would have had at their disposal. The Ottawa Senators selected Brown with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2016 NHL draft. The tournament opens on Monday and runs through January 5. It is being co-hosted by Toronto and Montreal."}

The Bolts also left the game far less healthy, a significant bummer since injuries have already been an issue for the Lightning. About the best news is that Victor Hedman seems like he’s OK after an injury scare. Jonathan Drouin and Braydon Coburn may not have been so lucky. Both players were unable to return from their injuries on Friday, and as the Tampa Bay Times’ Roger Mooney reports, their outlooks are unclear at the moment.

By winning their 12th game in a row with a 2-1 victory against the Montreal Canadiens, the Blue Jackets are more clearly seeing the benefits of their hot streak. Here’s how the Metro looks at the moment: 1. Blue Jackets – 50 points in 32 games played. 2. Penguins – 49 points in 35 GP. 3. Rangers – 47 points in 36 GP. 4. Capitals – 44 points in 32 GP. 5.

The Chicago Blackhawks can tie things up with a win tonight, yet even then, the Blue Jackets will hold two games in hand. So, yeah, they’re the best team in the league right now. As far as Thursday’s game went, it was a tight game where a lot of usual suspects came up big. Sergei Bobrovsky made 36 out of 37 stops against the Canadiens, winning back-to-back games after allowing just a single goal in each contest. The scorers were also guys who have been generating points consistently for Columbus; Sam Gagner scored his 14th goal of 2016-17 while Brandon Saad nabbed his 13th. Nick Foligno generated two assists. That’s the sort of work that the Blue Jackets are, dare we say, starting to expect from these guys.

The Edmonton Oilers, with no playoff appearances since 2006, rank first, with a core of Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl, Jesse Puljujarvi and Oscar Klefbom.

The start time for the game will be 7 p.m. ET. The result here is that Carolina and Detroit will play a back-to-back set on the 27th and 28th, both at PNC. For the ‘Canes, it abbreviates what would’ve been a nice little break — they play New Jersey at home on the 25th, and would’ve had two nights off — and for Detroit, it makes for a very busy end of March. The Red Wings host Minnesota on the 26th, then play in Carolina on the 27th and 28th — the rare three-games-in-three-nights stretch."}

It’s always a nice treat to come home, Matthews said, per the Toronto Star. I’ll have pretty much my whole family (at Friday’s game), so it’ll be nice. I know I talked to my coach, who coached me in midget and bantam and stuff, and he said they had to cancel practice. Nobody wanted to go to practice (Friday) because we’re going in there playing. The Leafs played last night in Denver, where they smoked the hopeless Avalanche, 6-0, and Matthews notched his 16th goal. As of this morning, there were still tickets available for tonight’s game, but it’s expected to be a larger crowd than the average one at Gila River Arena (12,648 so far this season). Matthews’ dad, Brian, is looking forward to it. The fact he’s now going to be stepping on that ice and actually playing knowing 15, 16 years ago he was the one sitting on my knee watching, he told the Arizona Republic, it’s going to be pretty special. Matthews has already faced the Coyotes once. He scored a goal against them Dec. 15 in Toronto, but it was ex-Leaf Peter Holland who got the last laugh, notching the shootout winner for Arizona."}

{"id":958,"title":" Cheap shots from Connelly and Holmes have harmed Mayo ","class":1,"body":" Last Friday, The Irish Independent ran a blurb promoting their interview with Noel Connelly and Pat Holmeswrites John Fogarty. Truth be told, the Mayo players knew this day was coming long before the newspaper did. Some bought it on Saturday morning, some chose not to. Some still haven’t brought themselves to reading it, relying on what team-mates have told them. Not many have lost much shut-eye since then. Yes, some of the claims they consider outrageous and the ramblings of two scorned men but it will be a long time before anyone admits as much on record. There will be no official response. To do that would only fan the flames and Mayo has been burnt enough. Deep down, they know Connelly and Holmes would never have had the chance to sabotage them — and let’s be truthful that is exactly what they have done — had they beaten Dublin in the All-Ireland final replay. The pair mercilessly preyed on that fact. Of course, they were entitled to have their say but to insist they did it in the best interests of Mayo football was incredibly lousy. Connelly and Holmes had been lauded for their dignified departure 14 months ago but it was obvious to many in Mayo the coup stung them deeply long before they acknowledged it in print on Saturday. What wasn’t contemplated was how low they would go to jeopardise existing relationships between players in the camp. They alleged the selection of Andy Moran in last year’s Connacht semi-final was challenged by Alan Dillon. They also maintained Seamus O’Shea asked that his Breaffy club-mate Rob Hennelly be chosen ahead of David Clarke as he preferred his kick-outs. Plenty of unsubstantiated versions of that tale are already swirling around though none has gained any firm credence. While most of the reaction to Saturday’s interview has been balanced, some of it has been misguided. On Sunday, Eamonn Sweeney wrote in the Sunday Independent that Aidan O’Shea has been utterly peripheral in four All-Ireland finals. When TG4 show this year’s replay in the coming days, Sweeney may consider and admire O’Shea’s contribution to Lee Keegan’s goal. Only three Mayo players had more possessions in the drawn game. The finals may not have gone O’Shea’s way but utterly peripheral is an exaggeration. The attempted character assassination of O’Shea is arguably the most shameful aspect of the pair’s tirade. Their portrayal of him as a distracted sportsman doesn’t hold much water when you factor he enjoyed arguably his best season in 2015. It’s obvious that with O’Shea’s 40,000-plus Twitter followers Holmes’ line it won’t matter how many Twitter followers you had during your playing days is directed at him."}

It’s just hard to have such a long streak to the line without the officiating getting too friendly. However, the NBA’s Last Two Minute Report included two incorrectly called fouls – one by Denver and one by Atlanta. Still, the missed calls disproportionately benefited the Hawks. The first missed call in the report came with 1:43 left, when Malcolm Delaney was called for fouling Emmanuel Mudiay. Mudiay (DEN) trips, but not as a result of any contact by Delaney (ATL) that affects his SQBR. Mudiay made both free throws – two extra points for the Nuggets. he other incorrectly called foul was by Nikola Jokic on Thabo Sefolosha with 42.8 seconds left. NBA: Jokic (DEN) and Sefolosha (ATL) engage on the rebound. The contact is incidental and does not affect either player’s ability to retrieve the rebound. To compound matters, Nuggets Coach Michael Malone picked up a technical foul protesting the – we now know, incorrect – call. Of course, the Hawks made all three resulting free throws – trumping Denver’s two extra points. Plus, Jokic – the Nuggets’ best player – fouled out.

The hosts lacked the same spark which had driven them to three straight victories over Aberdeen, Hearts and Hamilton during a flat first half. The lacklustre Light Blues were given a scare 12 minutes in when Greg Tansey's cross was redirected goalwards by Losana Doumbouya but they were grateful his effort lacked the pace to beat the alert Wes Foderingham. Yet despite their lack of energy, Rangers found themselves in front 60 seconds later. Martyn Waghorn drove to byline before firing a cross into the box which seemed to be aimed at no one in particular. But it proved useful as McKay found himself unable to get out its path and watched in horror as the ball fired off his thigh before bouncing into this net. Gers, though, continued to live dangerously. Andy Halliday had Foderingham to thank when he played the ball straight to Larnell Cole in shooting territory, although the Ibrox midfielder did better when he unleashed a fierce hit from 25 yards which required a fine save by Owain Fon-Williams to prevent it finding the top corner. Foderingham had to rescue his side again on 35 minutes when Tansey was gifted time and space on the edge of Gers' box, springing to his right to the the ball behind for a corner. But he did not look so assured in the last piece of action before the break when he spilled Lee Hodson's headed backpass. The ball fell to Liam Polworth with the goal gaping but he let the chance slip as he fired into the side-netting. Garner had the chance to justify his new cult hero status after 67 minutes when Kenny Miller's deflected shot broke to him six yards out but he nudged his header wide. Tansey and Caley sub Aaron Doran both spurned decent chances to level as Rangers' nerves began to show. Jason Holt had the chance to ease their concerns with 13 minutes left but saw his side-footed finish turned away by Fon-Williams. But it took another important stop by Foderingham in the final minute to make sure of the points as he pushed away Scott Boden's strike."}

But Rodgers was happy to see returning striker Leigh Griffiths open the scoring four minutes from the break with his 13th goal of the season."}

The 33-year-old, who was out of contract at the end of the current campaign, has put pen to paper on a new two-and-a-half-year deal which will keep him at The Hawthorns until the summer of 2019.

Albion boss Tony Pulis has been pleased with Foster's form this season, keeping three clean sheets as the club head into the Christmas schedule eighth in the table ahead of the St Stephen's Day trip to Arsenal. We're delighted we've extended Ben's contract. His form this season has been there for all to see and he continues to set the standards at the club all the goalkeepers have to aspire to, said Pulis. Foster joined West Brom on loan from Birmingham in 2011 before making the move permanent the following year. He has made 161 appearances for the club in all competitions, keeping 41 clean sheets and follows midfielders Craig Gardner and Claudio Yacob and Pulis himself in committing his future to the club in recent months."}

With just one win in his last 11 matches, his departure from Palace was hardly a massive shock in itself, but the timing meant that the new boss will hardly have his feet under the desk before facing a quick-fire schedule of Christmas fixtures. Honestly thought Pardew would survive at Palace for a while longer. In truth, perhaps no manager could survive the shimmy. So what does it mean for fantasy managers? Well, it looks like Palace defenders are back on the menu! Chairman Steve Parish has pledged to wind the dial back the other way from Pardew's expansive style of football. And with Big Sam Allardyce in charge, consider it done, Steve. Fantasy managers can now look to bring in Scott Dann (CRY, 5.3) once that tricky GW19 trip to Arsenal is out of the way - the centre back ranks joint top for attempts on goal in the box (12) this season, and if he can add some clean sheets to his returns, you’re laughing."}

Barca, who have reached the final five times in the last six years, have won the Copa del Rey 28 times while Athletic have lifted the trophy 23 times - although not since 1984.

The other eye-catching tie from Friday's draw sees 19-time winners Real take on Sevilla - throwing the reigning Champions League winners against the three-time Europa League holders. Real director Emilio Butragueno, whose side host the first leg at the Bernabeu, said on his club's website: It doesn't matter if the first game is at home or away.

Good news for boxer Nick Blackwell as his brother tells @pasport that he is smiling again after waking from a coma. The 26-year-old from Trowbridge had been in a stable condition, but remained in a coma until this week. Nick is doing well considering the damage he has had, Daniel said. He's looking around, moving his arms and legs, and is drinking, eating and smiling again. Rehab is going to take a long time, but he has done amazingly well so far. The British Boxing Board of Control has been investigating the circumstances surrounding the sparring session that placed Blackwell's life in danger and plan to hold a hearing in January. Blackwell's boxing licence had been withdrawn before last month's ill-advised sparring session after collapsing at the end of his defeat by Chris Eubank Jnr in March. On that occasion he was found to have suffered a bleed on the skull and was put into an induced coma. Blackwell, who remains in hospital, made a full recovery and subsequently announced his retirement from the
